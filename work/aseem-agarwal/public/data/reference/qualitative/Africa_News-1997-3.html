<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE, TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. EASTERN ZAIRE - information as of 27 February</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) At the same time that an attempt is made at a political solution to the crisis in Eastern Zaire, military action continues. Exploratory talks were held in South Africa but efforts for direct contacts between the Zairean Government and the rebels were frustrated. Separate discussions were however maintained with South African, US and UN officials. On the military side, the capture of Kalima and the advance of the rebels towards Kindu mark the most significant developments of the past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) A WFP/UNHCR mission visited Punia to assess the refugee situation at this location. Punia was previously a transit point for refugees on their way to Tingi Tingi. Once fears about a possible attack on Tingi Tingi spread, refugees refused to travel any further and camped in Punia. There are now some 4,000 refugees accommodated in the former prison, the local hospital and an abandoned motor garage. The refugees, in very poor nutritional state, had been surviving on high-energy biscuits and WFP organised an air delivery of 6 metric tons of supplies two day after the mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Kisangani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) The situation in the Kisangani area is tense. At a recent security meeting, a reduction in the field presence of UN and NGO staff members was recommended. Other recommendations included the transfer of all non-essential communications equipment and a maximisation of food distributions in refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) A total of 2,762 metric tons of food has been airlifted into Kisangani since air operations were initiated by WFP on 18 December 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Tingi Tingi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Since the beginning of February, a total 13,045 refugees have arrived in Tingi Tingi. Between 18 and 23 February, 510 metric tons of food were distributed in the Tingi Tingi camps, bringing the total WFP food distributed since mid-December to 1,930 metric tons of food. This past week was the first time that a nearly full weekly ration was distributed to the total camp population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Between 18 and 23 February, the WFP DC3 made 21 rotations between Kisangani and Tingi Tingi, shuttling 83 metric tons of maize, vegetable oil, corn soya blend and beans. Road operations were reduced as adequate stock had previously been delivered, and only 88 metric tons of food were trucked to Tingi Tingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Kalima</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Some 25,000 Hutu refugees are once more on the move after fleeing Kalima.  The camp, opened by UNHCR on February 17, was deserted less than a week later when Zairean rebels captured the town on 22 February. It took less than one hour for all refugees to leave. Residents of Kalima town had started fleeing earlier. The refugees had previously been accommodated at Shabunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Before the departure of the refugees from Kalima, WFP had succeeded in making 10 rotations with the Andover plane, delivering 53 metric tons of mixed foods to the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 Goma</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Sporadic fighting between Mai-Mai and Alliance rebels continues to be reported. Pockets of the former Rwandan army and militia also continue to engage Alliance rebels. Despite these incidents, aid workers resumed activities at way stations on 21 February in the northern axis. Between 17 and 23 February, 496 refugees repatriated through Goma, about half the level of the weekly average earlier in the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) A WFP/UNHCR mission drove to the Ishasha border to assess cross-border population movements, and reported that Zaireans who had sought refugee in Uganda are returning home. Aid agencies in Goma are preparing to assist these people to settle back in home areas. Ishasha is still closed to commercial traffic. The Bunagana entry point, further south, is operational, but a 48- hour notice is required for customs formalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 Bukavu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Bukavu quiet as situation calms following the bombing raids of 17 February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Rehabilitation works continue along the Kigulube road. WFP has released food for use in this programme, a priority for humanitarian agencies.  Distribution of food at way stations has been handed over to UNHCR and NGOs.  WFP is assessing food assistance needs among local populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 Kigoma continues to receive an average of 1,000 refugees each day and the refugee population in the area stands now at 248,480 people. Over 23,000 of these refugees are accommodated in three holding centres in Kigoma town.  The recently opened Lugufu camp already hosts over 10,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 WFP is preparing a new Emergency Operation to assist drought-affected persons. WFP plans to make available 10,000 metric tons of maize and 1,000 metric tons of beans, for positioning in drought-stricken zones, for distribution once the planned targeting exercise is carried out. The food will be distributed by NGOs, through food-for-work activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 Adapting to the new working environment, between 17 and 23 February WFP succeeded in delivering 2,068 metric tons of food for distribution in the communes, a marked increase over the previous week. Food is positioned in all prefectures, and distributions for the month of February are continuing.  Byumba was the first prefecture to complete the February commitment but distributions are also progressing well in the prefecture of Kigali Rural, where an average 100 metric tons of food a day is being delivered. The lack of exact beneficiary numbers and details, and the need for military escorts to be provided, have led to delays in some areas, and the prefecture of Ruhengeri has been unable to deliver food during February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 The number of returnees travelling back from South Kivu between 17 and 23 February numbered 1,311, bringing the total for the month to 3,135 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 Seeds and tools are in the process of being distributed to returnees.  If completed in time, these distributions will enable the majority of the returnees to plant their first crops in several years, a major step towards self-sufficiency. It is hoped that by June, these beneficiaries will no longer be dependent on WFP's food assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.4 A WFP headquarters mission is currently visiting Rwanda to look into a future monetization programme. The programme aims at raising some USD 35 million through the sale of food, for the development of Rwanda. The actual sale of the food is likely to take place in Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, and will involve WFP and other partner agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.5 WFP has positioned a Twin Otter in Kigali, to service locations within Rwanda difficult to access by road due to insecurity, particularly Cyangugu, and Bukavu across the border. The aircraft will be ferrying cargo and passengers, and will be on standby for emergency evacuations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 A seed distribution programme co-ordinated by FAO is presently ongoing, to reach all parts of the country. WFP is effecting the seeds distribution in some areas, and providing food for an estimated 110,000 people at internally displaced persons sites and regroupment sites. The provision of a combined seeds/food package is to minimise the risk that seeds may be used for consumption, rather than for planting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 WFP and MSF-Holland suspended activities in Kabarore commune, Kayanza province, following confrontations between the military and rebels who reportedly crossed the border among the refugees. Although in general there seems to be a slight improvement in the security situation, incidents are still reported in various areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 Authorisation has been granted by the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee for fixed quotas of fuel, including Jet A-1, to be imported into Burundi for the use of UN agencies and NGOs. The quantities of fuel now approved are those initially requested, but no exemption made for importing kerosene, badly needed for storage and transportation of vaccines and medical supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 A new WFP emergency operation (EMOP 5816) worth USD 6.7 million has just been approved to assist 110,000 internally displaced persons in northern districts. Total food requirements are 9,766 metric tons. Food assistance will be provided during a six-month period, as much as possible through food- for-work schemes. Rebel insurgency in northern Uganda has resulted in the displacement of over 220,000 people. WFP's assistance will be provided to those who, displaced from their land and sources of income, have no alternative to provide for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Urgent food contributions are needed to continue the provision of assistance to Sudanese refugees. Current WFP resources will be depleted by April, including a recently donated contribution of 15,000 metric tons of grain. Some cash for local purchases has been made available, but a combination of drought and insecurity has led to low maize production in Uganda, and it is unlikely that purchases may be effected in time to ensure undisrupted deliveries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. ETHIOPIA/SOMALIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Repatriation of Somali refugees from Ethiopia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The voluntary repatriation of 290,000 Somalis from Ethiopia has begun, with the return of several hundred refugees to the north-west of Somalia, where the political situation has recently improved. A total of 2,800 Somalis have registered for repatriation from Teferi Ber and Doronaji camps, near Jijiga, and UNHCR expects 10,000 refugees to return home by the end of May.  Each returnee receives nine months worth of food, provided by WFP, and the equivalent of 30 dollars in travel funds from UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. LIBERIA AND SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. LIBERIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Demobilisation has come to end with more than 21,315 soldiers, including 4,306 child and 250 adult female soldiers disarmed and demobilised over the period 22 November 1996 to 7 February 1997. This represents over 91 percent of ECOMOG's estimate of the total number of fighters (33,000).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 WFP has contributed more than 600 metric tons of food aid towards the demobilisation process and continues to support demobilised soldiers through EU and UN Office of Project Services (UNOPS) &quot;bridging&quot; projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 WFP led an inter-agency assessment mission to Bomi County from 11-12 February. The mission found an improved nutritional situation in Tubmanburg, Government Farm/Gaya Hill and Gbah. Feeding centres in Government Farm and Gbah have been closed due to the improved nutritional situation and increasing accessibility to the region. Security has improved since the end of January and no incidents of harassment have been reported. Commodities such as rice, bulgur wheat, maize meal and palm oil brought from Monrovia are available at the household level and in limited quantities in local markets.  Priority needs of the population in Gbah and Government Farm are agricultural inputs, medicine and clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Demobilisation has prompted the spontaneous return of internally displaced persons from Monrovia shelters to their villages in parts of Bomi, Cape Mount, Bong and Margibi Counties. In shelters managed by the Concerned Christian Community, the population has dropped from 73,302 to 51,100 persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 An inter-agency assessment mission to Lofa County on 12 February confirmed reports of increasing numbers of returnees from Guinea to Foya and Zorzor districts, towns that have been destroyed by war and abandoned for several years. Reportedly more than 1,000 returnees, mostly men, have crossed the border to assess and clean up villages before sending for the rest of their family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 The Liberia Committee on Food Aid (CFA), chaired by WFP, was established on 31 January. Members include CRS, EU and USAID. This committee, modelled after the CFA in Sierra Leone, will coordinate all food aid policies and strategies in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 Peace violations have been reported along the Bo-Freetown highway and roads and villages in the northern and eastern provinces as RUF leader calls on troops to resume activities. However WFP activities have continued as normal with the exception of a halt on deliveries from 19-20 February due to attacks on the Bo-Freetown highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 In a bid to move the peace process forward, the Committee for the Consolidation of Peace (CCP) is holding talks with RUF rebel leader Foday Sankoh in Abidjan. All necessary structures are in place for the start of demobilisation once Government/RUF agreements are finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 Government soldiers have rescued some 700 unaccompanied children living in the forest in Kailahun district. The children, aged 9 to 15, apparently fled rebel attacks four years ago and are reported to be severely malnourished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. ANGOLA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Save the Children US closed its Quibaxe office in Bengo Province after repeated armed attacks on its warehouse. The latest incident occurred 10 February when more than 200 metric tonnes WFP food and 111 resettlement kits were looted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 On 17 February a joint WFP-German Agro Action mission to Bocoio, Benguela Province confirmed damaged maize crops due to lack of rain. WFP will provide packages of 9 kg of maize, 1.2 kg of beans and 0.75 litre of vegetable oil for an estimated 10,000 people. Lack of rain in the provinces of Bengo, Cuanza Sul, Cuanza Norte, Luanda Malange, and Zaire continues to threaten this year's harvests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 On 17 February a joint CRS, UNICEF, UCAH, MSF-F, OXFAM, Human Rights Watch and WFP mission visited Cubal in Benguela Province to investigate reports of attacks on Iambala village, 45 km south of Cubal. Some 3,000 to 5, 000 displaced people in the area will be given food rations and health care services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 The poor condition of the Luena airstrip in Moxico Province and the complexity of flight clearance procedures at Catumbela air base have limited WFP's capacity to transport cargo by air. Since October 1996, Government repairs to the airstrip have not been made, reducing the number of possible flights per day from six to three. As a result, WFP will begin transporting cargo by road at a greater cost (USD 15-USD 20 more per metric ton) and time- frame (5-6 days) due to poor road conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 Discussions on the political aspects of the peace process continue.  Some 215 FAA underage soldiers were demobilised on 14 February in Luanda and transported to their areas of origin. WFP has assumed responsibility for distribution of reintegration rations to ex-combatants who were demobilised three or more months ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - International staff of UN agencies and international NGOs were today evacuated by 12.15 local time from Kisangani, eastern Zaire, to the Zairean capital, Kinshasa. Three flights evacuated international staff. A WFP representative said that national staff remained in Kisangani, and would try to maintain operations and communications &quot;as best they can under the circumstances&quot;. The departure of international humanitarian agencies from Tingi-Tingi and Kisangani effectively severs established channels of communication with the largest camp for Rwandans in eastern Zaire. One UN official said to IRIN that the pull-out &quot;places considerable responsibility on UNHCR to locate the refugees afresh and re-establish contact&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A rebel spokesman told Reuters on Friday that ADFL troops were six kilometres from the Tingi-Tingi camps, but that the advance was being held back &quot;to resolve the problem of the refugees&quot;. Spokesman Mwenze Kongoro, described as rebel &quot;minister of justice&quot;, said from Kigali that the ADFL would eventually take Tingi-Tingi &quot;but not right now&quot;. One NGO said that its local staff in the camp had been &quot;primarily Rwandans&quot;. Rwandans from the Tingi-Tingi camps - holding some 160,000 people - started leaving the camp yesterday in fear of rebel attack. Camp leaders, however, have exercised strong control over the camp population, and are known to be defending the front line. Sources from Tingi-Tingi say the camp leadership set up its own policing, jails and justice system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rebel radio &quot;Voice of the People&quot; said today that ADFL troops had taken Kindu, but were still &quot;chasing the last enemy soldiers out&quot;. It said there was still sporadic fighting. The Zairean defence ministry denied today that the garrision town of Kindu fell to the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) on Thursday, and claims to have sent in reinforcements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rebel radio claimed on Friday that a military aircraft belonging to the Zairean armed forces was shot down on Thursday morning near Kisangani by the ADFL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Yesterday, the US government urged both Zaire and rebel leader Laurent- Desire Kabila to restrict their military activities to avoid jeopardizing attempts at peace talks in South Africa. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the US called upon the parties &quot;to refrain from any military actions in the coming days that would undermine prospects for peace and that would create further sufferings and instability in Zaire itself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The South African government yesterday denied allegations that Zairean envoy Honore Ngbanda had no authorisation to attend the talks. On Thursday, Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo told Reuters news agency that Kabila was considered &quot;a puppet&quot;. Kabila has now reportedly left South Africa. There have been no face-to-face talks yet between the warring parties, but South African, US and UN officials have held &quot;close proximity talks&quot; with Kabila and Zairean envoy, Honore Ngbanda, who is President Mobutu's nephew and senior security advisor. There have been conflicting responses towards the talks from members of the Zairean government, which says &quot;foreign troops&quot; must first be withdrawn from eastern Zaire before a peace conference can be held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Joint OAU/UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region, Mohamed Sahnoun, arrived in Paris on Friday for talks with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and other officials on the Zaire crisis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NELSPRUIT - Mpumalanga's provincial government admitted for the first time on Thursday that there are serious flaws in the secret R12,2-billion agreement which it signed last year with the controversial Dubai-based Dolphin Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians in the province stress however that they are legally bound to honour the contract for the full 50-years that it remains in force and that all they can really do is recommend certain changes in it to Dolphin president, Ketan Somaia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia is currently at the centre of a R35-million government tender scandal in Kenya, where a recommendation by Kenya's Public Accounts Committee has been tabled in Parliament to ban government from ever doing business with either Somaia or any company associated with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mpumalanga deal gives Dolphin a monopoly of all commercial development and transverse rights in at least six State owned game reserves, the world's second biggest canyon at the Blyde River Canyon, the world famous historic town of Pilgrim's Rest and Loskop Dam for the full 50-year period.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga Parks Board (MPB) head, Alan Gray, signed the contentious contract without any public consultation on November 1 last year but only admitted its existence four weeks later when investigative news agency, African Eye News Service, reported on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bowing to wide-spread outrage amongst affected communities, central government officials and conservationists, provincial environmental affairs MEC, David Mkhwanazi, said on Thursday that despite initial government condemnation of criticism, a review of the contract had revealed at least ten serious flaws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include, he said, clauses demanding absolute secrecy of the contract's terms for 50-years, the actual granting of rights to the region's prime natural heritage sites for 50-years instead of a shorter period and clauses enabling Dolphin to pull out of the deal without any liability should it be dissatisfied with the numbers of tourists visiting the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPB's continuing disregard for gazetted land claims on at least three of the core development areas and its continuing failure to consult with affected communities were also identified as major stumbling blocks, as was the fact that MPB would be responsible for conducting all environmental impact assessments (EIA) for Dolphin develop-ments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics insist that the fact that Dolphin will be bankrolling MPB's budget for the 50-years that the contract remains in force could unduly influence its ability to conduct unbiased EIAs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conceding that public objections had been &quot;fair&quot;, Mkhwanazi added that clauses in the contract granting Dolphin exclusive rights to Africa's last undeveloped 'Big Five' reserve, Manyeleti, plus Pilgrim's Rest and two Adventura resorts, would have to be removed completely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The critics had a very good argument here, as Manyeleti isn't even part of Mpumalanga yet, so we can't talk about it, while Pilgrim's Rest actually falls under the Public Works department and not under MPB,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, Adventura is not in my jurisdiction at all - it falls under the national ministry. The objections were therefore fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the fiasco as an &quot;expensive lesson&quot;, Mhkwanazi also confirmed that he had been instructed to keep national environment minister, Pallo Jordan and tourism minister, Peter Mokaba, briefed of all further developments on a weekly basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows both his department's and MPB's failure to deliver a copy of the 39-page contract to either MP during initial briefing sessions last week and also the failure to turn over reports from the province's watchdog Environmental Council (EC) condemning the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mkhwanazi instead suspended the R30 000 per month EC because of &quot; unacceptable spiraling running costs&quot; and axed his personal consultant, Rupert Lorimer, when he objected to the deal in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lorimer was reinstated on Tuesday and appears to have been instrumental in forcing the government to admit to flaws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ketan Somaia, in turn, confirmed that the secrecy clause in the contract had been included at his insistence, in order to keep details of Dolphin's offer secret from possible competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismissing the suggestion that the deal should have been public because the land on which it is based is a valuable public asset, Somaia insisted that &quot; no-one should force us to put this in the public arena ... we do not want to give (our competitors) an edge&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refused to comment on the possibility that if the contract was public, competitors may have offered MPB more than the R12,2-billion he has committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether Dolphin would have been able to secure similar sweeping exclusive commercial rights in First World countries, such as attempting to get exclusive development rights to the Grand Canyon in the USA, Somaia insisted that &quot;no, but Africa is different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a completely different concept here. Its not the same at all,&quot; is all he would say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Dolphin's undertaking to build a public tourism school, plow at least R4-million into small business development and fund the province's first ever international airport, opposition politicians in the province have also pledged their support to Somaia.  A delegation from both opposition parties, the National Party and the Freedom Front, announced that they were &quot; awed by Dolphin's professionalism&quot; after returning from an all expense paid trip to Dolphin's lodges and hotels in Kenya and Dubai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa is not for sissies. In any case, if you look at the amounts involved, then the alleged (R35-million) misappropriation is like a drop of water in the sea compared to the Kenyan economy - or even the Dolphin economy.  All businessmen have at least some deals that go sour and some that work out, &quot; said FF legislative whip, Hein Mentz, when quizzed about Somaia's failure to deliver on a Kenyan government tender he won seven years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPB's head, Gray, insists that he has a letter from Kenyan president, Daniel arap Moi, clearing Somaia of any wrongdoing in the case but both Moi's office and Kenya's High Commission in South Africa deny the existence of the letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will be talking to Somaia as soon as possible about amendments to the contract, as this thing is very very urgent. It is extremely urgent and the sooner we put this whole episode behind us, the better,&quot; said Mkhwanazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why affected communities and other interested parties should trust the government to handle the issue properly this time, Mkhwanazi would only say &quot;they'll just have to wait and see&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They'll get the best out of this deal yet,&quot; he promised.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila claimed in Goma, eastern Zaire, yesterday that his troops had captured Tingi-Tingi and its airport, and the strategically important town of Lubutu, 200 kilometers southeast of Kisangani.  Tingi-Tingi camps in eastern Zaire held some 170,000 Rwandans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila said he had ordered troops of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) not to hurt refugees, and invited UNHCR and humanitarian agencies to come back to Tingi-Tingi to give assistance.  Today, the ADFL issued an ultimatum for senior army officers to join the ADFL by March 13 or &quot;be considered rebels, with all the consequences that this carries&quot;, rebel spokesman Giles Ingala Gwamona announced in Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been no independent confirmation of rebel victories or refugee movements; the evacuation of international staff from UN and NGOs on Saturday, from Kisangani and Tingi-Tingi, has effectively severed independent information to the outside world. 57 international staff were evacuated from Kisangani to Kinshasa on Saturday morning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees appealed to all concerned in the conflict to allow unimpeded humanitarian access to refugees caught in the fighting. The refugees were in poor condition before they left the camps, with more than thirty dying daily, mostly infants and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, thousands of refugees were reported on the move by foot and by truck towards Kisangani, reports AFP, quoting sources from Kisangani. Zairean truck drivers said they saw a 15-kilometer column of refugees, moving out of Lubutu on the road to Kisangani. A humanitarian source told IRIN that a plane overflying Tingi-Tingi on Sunday reported that the camps appeared empty.  There are also many local Zaireans displaced by the conflict; but humanitarian agencies have no figures regarding the size of the internally displaced population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila, however, claimed thousands of refugees had returned when rebels moved in. At his rebel headquarters in Goma, he was quoted by news agencies as saying he wanted those in the camp &quot;to be repatriated to their own country and we will give a secure corridor for their evacuation&quot;. Kabila had only last week promised he would &quot;hold back&quot; his troops from Tingi-Tingi camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest claims come as South African mediated talks continue to try to find a solution to the conflict and implement a ceasefire. Kabila refused last week to sign a ceasefire proposal in South Africa, in the &quot;close proximity talks&quot; mediated by South African, UN and US officials. He told journalists that he would only negotiate directly with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, saying the ADFL &quot;waits for an invitation from Mobutu to say that he personally will negotiate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mobutu, now in France recovering from treatment of prostrate cancer, has decided to delay his return home for a few days. An aide told journalists that the decision was unrelated to his health, and was to pursue his search for a solution to the eastern Zaire crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French NGO Cepza Celpa said today that Kisangani was calm, and that no refugees had been seen arriving from the Tingi-Tingi/Lubutu area. Kisangani is the last significant stronghold of the Zairean army in eastern Zaire. A journalist who recently returned from Kisangani said the Zairean army, with the assistance of mercenaries, were mounting air attacks out of Kisangani two or three times a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers express surprise that Tingi-Tingi camps fell so quickly, as Rwandan militia, including former Rwandan soldiers, were known to be vigorously defending the area. However, previous events have demonstrated that the dispersal of refugees significantly undermines the military position of the Rwandan fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of international journalists have been invited today by General Mahele, Chief of Staff, to fly to Kisangani. Sources say the General has promised to take journalists by helicopter to survey the Kisangani area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC has taken note of instructions given to police with regard to the use of force in effecting an arrest against suspects. The ANC is of the view that the instruction is an internal police guide issued for operational purposes given by police management.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC will therefore not seek to elevate an operational matter to the level of substantive policy issues. The debate that is currently taking place with regard to the matter must, rather than sensationalise the matter, address itself on the most appropriate measures that police must undertaken in effecting such arrests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - ANC STATEMENT ON THE DECISION OF THE AMNESTY COMMITTEE NOT TO REVEAL NAMES OF ALLEGED INFORMERS IN GOVERNMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to media queries regarding the attitude of the ANC towards the decision of the Amnesty Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee on revealing names of former police informers allegedly in high government circles, the ANC takes this opportunity to publish a letter from Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to the TRC's Amnesty Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter summarises the attitude of the ANC towards the issue at hand:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 1, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Hassen Mall, Chairperson, Amnesty Committee, Truth and Reconciliation Committee, CAPE TOWN.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Judge Mall,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to reports which appear in today's newspapers, Mr Roelf du Plessis, a lawyer representing five former Security Branch police officers who are applying for amnesty, has asked that his clients be allowed not to disclose the names of &quot;top government officials&quot; who allegedly worked as informers for the Security Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reportedly, the reason he gave for this request is that disclosing the names of the informers would put them in danger and be grossly unfair to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press further reports that you will make a ruling on the matter on Monday, March 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African National Congress is of the firm view that the Amnesty Committee should deny the request made by Mr du Plessis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have always understood that full disclosure of the truth is an inalienable part of both the amnesty process and the search for national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument that the lives of informers would be threatened by the fact of disclosure, does not make sense when viewed against the disclosures that affect people who were directly involved in carrying out actual murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The informer network established by the apartheid organs of state was part of the machinery responsible for gross violation of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the process of ensuring that such violations do not recur, it is vital that this machinery in all its parts should be disclosed and dismantled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reluctance to disclose the informer network indicates that it has not been dismantled. It also suggests that the network continues to be used for purposes which cannot but be inimical to the process of reconciliation and the protection of the democratic order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For these reasons, we strongly urge the Amnesty Committee to direct that the disclosure be made both with regard to the hearing in question as well as all other relevant hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yours faithfully,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Private hospital group Clinic Holdings has bought a 64 percent stake in the Libertas Hospital in Goodwood for R15,8 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed Clinic Group bought the holding from D &amp; E Health Benefits, a wholly owned subsidiary of Norwich Holdings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D &amp; E will keep a 26 percent stake in Libertas and some of the medical aid societies it manages will hold the balance of the shareholding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libertas will be integrated into the network of 26 private hospitals owned by Clinic Holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinic Holdings' Mark Palmer said the 196-bed Libertas Hospital fitted perfectly into the group's spread of speciality services. Libertas' rehabilitation facility for spinal injuries and its psychiatry unit would complement the cardiac unit in the City Park Hospital, the arthritis, haematology and oncology specialisations in Wynberg Hospital and the trauma unit at the new N1 City Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D &amp; E Health Benefits managing director Robin Melville said the sale of Libertas was good for both groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not practical to operate a single hospital in the modern trend towards hospital chains, where there are huge synergies in being part of a group operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see great advantages in joining forces through Libertas with Clinic Holdings,&quot; Mr Melville said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospitals in the Clinic group would be added to the list of preferred hospitals for the medical aid societies managed by D &amp; E, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinic Holdings already has a tie-up with Southern Healthcare, jointly owned by Anglo American, Southern Life and United Healthcare of the United States, and with Apex Healthcare Network, a joint venture between African Oxygen and Medic-Clinic. Managed health care contracts between Southern, Clinic and Apex were signed last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Cape Metropolitan Council has given its tacit endorsement to Cape Town's Olympic vision by contributing R2,5-million to the bid effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By all accounts Cape Town's Olympian hopes are well founded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">International perceptions, despite the grave imprint made by crime, acknowledge the reality of a city not only technically capable of staging a Games that would do credit to Olympic ideals, but which would provide a beautiful and fitting setting for the first African Olympics in the history of the modern Olympic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naturally, international perceptions are a little different from South Africa's, focused as we are on the challenges and opportunities of the transition, and of casting the foundation for a stable future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the South African Olympic vision is no less romantic, it is meshed with the anxieties and hopes that South Africans have about their future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's R2,5-million contribution to the bid by the Cape Metropolitan Council has underscored two things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firstly, support for the bid spans virtually the entire political spectrum, and the project has the confidence of key decision-makers in the city.  Secondly, there is lingering concern about how public resources are used when many pressing causes deserve treasury attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What should not be forgotten is the fact that the bid itself is geared to stimulating economic growth which will benefit all communities, considerably increase national and local tax revenues, create thousands of permanent jobs, and affirm South Africa's place in the world market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, most importantly, it is for these very reasons that three independent and scientifically conducted surveys have shown overwhelming national and local support for the project. Vigilance is vital, but so, too, is an acknowledgement of the informed optimism that is the essential spirit of South Africa's Olympic plan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is not a certain indication of how the International Olympic Committee's selection college will think in Lausanne on Friday, but it is a significant pointer to international perceptions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey was conducted by the international sports newsletter, Sport Intern, published and edited by Karl-Heinz Huba, who is reputed to be close to IOC president Juan Samaranch and certainly well-connected within the Olympic fraternity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Huba asked all 11 candidates to name their short-list choices. Four cities declined to take part. Athens, with seven out of seven, was the only city tipped by all candidates as a certainty on the short list. Rome was next with six votes, and Cape Town and Stockholm third with four votes each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro and Seville (which is generally regarded as a rank outsider) each got two votes, and Buenos Aires got only one. Lille, St Petersburg and San Juan were not mentioned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - About three decades ago, the idea surfaced that Africa needed its own news service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was at the height of decolonisation, and the thought would have been inspired by politics rather than by any great desire to see a free flow of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took a while, till 1983, for it to come to fruition. The Organisation for Africa Unity then set up the Panafrican News Agency (Pana). It never was a success, though.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few of the participating governments paid the money they promised. Its problems were compounded by the bad communications systems in most countries.  And making matters no easier was the fact that many of Pana's contributing national news agencies were required to write the news the way their governments liked it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sad saga was recalled at a conference held in Johannesburg last week to see if the idea could be revived of setting up an Africa news service, or of finding ways of closer cooperation between the continent's media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference was arranged by the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism and was attended by journalists from several African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose was to discuss the need and feasibility of co-operation rather than to take firm decisions. However, despite being so tentative, it differed in such important ways from the first attempt to launch an all-Africa news agency that it must have a much better chance of success than the OAU attempt ever had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One difference was that it was journalists, not politicians, talking. The theme, Africans Reporting Africa, might have seemed a bit ideological. But it wasn't. It was a practical question: how to improve coverage of Africa, and how to get an Africa perspective into that coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The few times politics came into the discussion, it was mainly to emphasise the need for more light to be shed on government activities in some countries.  Politics tended to be treated with fair cynicism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the questions was whether it might be possible for the OAU's Pana to be restructured into a proper continental news agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pana representative from Dakar, Senegal, thought it could. He admitted Pana was finished as a state-sponsored news agency. But it was being privatised, and, no longer needing to do the bidding of governments, he thought it had the infrastructure and the experience to be turned into a news agency that could provide the Africa perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A journalist from Tanzania doubted this. In her language, she said, the word for excrement sounded much like Pana. It made her think that, from experience of what the agency used to produce, it should at the very least change its name before expecting other media to join in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A journalist from Nairobi said many countries couldn't make their own news agencies work, so what about Pana which had to rely on these agencies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without quite resolving the Pana question, the search switched to, among others, the Inter-Press Service (IPS), which is based in Harare. It is a subscriber service which disseminates news by E-mail but which also makes use of the Sita communications system, used by airlines, to gather information in parts where there are no telephones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another agency is Misa (Media Institute for Southern Africa), which is based in Windhoek. Formed in 1989 to serve southern Africa in virtual opposition to what its founders saw as South Africa's information monopolies, it is now eager to link up with this country's media to expand its service.  Its only condition for membership is support for media freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This marks another important difference from the earlier attempts to establish an Africa news service - South Africa's becoming part of the African family. There are sensitivities about the potential for &quot;South African imperialism&quot;, in the sense of trying to dominate through the power of its economy and communications system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, there can be no doubt that for such a venture to succeed, the South African media will have to take a leading part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It makes great sense for South Africa's media to do exactly that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if any one factor is destined to put Africa in touch with herself and with the world, it is the advent of the Internet. Some of the journalists present told about the problems experienced elsewhere on the continent, of there being no telephone links in places and of lines, where they do exist, sometimes being down for weeks mainly as a result of rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, in about 30 countries the media already have E-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives at the conference did not speak quite in terms of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's visions of an African renaissance, and of the information superhighway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But several argued that it could make life easier for many people if media link-ups, now becoming so much easier through E-mail, helped shed light on conditions in all parts of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this way, it was thought, E-mail, and through that the media, could well become Africa's most potent weapon against ignorance, excesses and maladministration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cape Town city manager Andrew Boraine and his team of executive directors are a quarter of the way into a 100-day programme, and they're &quot; letting the sunlight in&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the expression Mr Boraine chooses to describe the new era of open administration which is dawning down at the civic centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this particular day he has agreed to let me sit in on a management meeting and later accompany the team on a visit to Mitchell's Plain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the 100 days in mid-May, he and the team intend to repair to Robben Island to assess whether they have achieved their initial targets - including meetings with ratepayers and civic organisations and visits to all 44 wards while steering the municipality through a tricky restructuring period.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having a journalist in a management meeting was definitely a first for the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that there was any real sunlight shining into the city manager's boardroom last Tuesday morning. The net curtains were drawn and you couldn't see the magnificent backdrop of Table Mountain outside. All you could hear was the thundering rattle of the south-easter which places you firmly in downtown Cape Town. They were intent on getting on with the business of launching the city into a new era and not about to be distracted by one of the physical wonders of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the meeting, which starts at 8am, there's the usual scramble for coffee, finalising of reports and dealing with urgent phone calls, interspersed with early morning pleasantries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm fine,&quot; replies Mike Marsden, executive director of municipal services, to one such greeting. &quot;Just pressed between one deadline and the next.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Daniels, in charge of urban planning and economic development, breezes past, saying: &quot;I'm starting the day with a crisis. It's just a normal day...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men are the &quot;old boys&quot; on the team, having worked for the Cape Town City Council for a number of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happens, Mr Daniels doesn't join us at the management meeting, which runs almost until 1 pm. He is off to a meeting with Sports Minister Steve Tshwete on issues affecting the Olympic bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member of the team filters in, Philip van Ryneveld, head of finance.  The fifth, Ahmed Vawda, in charge of community development, comes to Cape Town from Gauteng. He is the last to arrive - &quot;still getting used to Cape Town traffic&quot;, says Mr Boraine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in the meeting are long-standing city officials, assistant city administrator Gill Bolton, deputy city treasurer Peter Lever, and consultant Nico McLachlan, who is helping the municipality through restructuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lever does a double-take at a journalist's presence, saying: &quot;I hope that you're not going to be in on this one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, I'm in. The agreement is that the management team will indicate if they think something is too sensitive for publication and I will treat it as an off-the-record remark. Happily, such occurrences are remarkably few and far between.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First up is Mr Lever's presentation on the budget process. It all takes rather a long time but no-one falters in the attention paid to the broad principles which will have to be followed for the next year's budget and the existing constraints which are being laid before them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Boraine asks a few key questions. How are projects filtered to avoid vested interest? What hangovers from the past are there? How do you balance the need for redistribution with maintaining reasonable levels of service in more affluent areas? And, finally, does the city have an audit of all existing facilities to avoid an ad-hoc, demand-driven approach?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His questions, and the observations thrown out by other members of the team, give an indication of what strategic management is about - anticipating problems and formulating strategies to deal with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rallying cry of the new team is &quot;do more with less&quot;, and it becomes patently clear during the budget discussion that this is precisely what will have to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next up is a quick briefing on the agendas of the executive committee and full council meeting which takes place later in the week, along with a general observation that the team needs to prevent agendas from becoming an &quot; ad-hoc mish-mash&quot; of items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's a bit of discussion on the joint operating team, otherwise called JOT, which is described as a &quot;holding operation&quot; and has the job of keeping services going during restructuring until the new second level of management is in place. Mr Marsden and Mr Vawda take responsibility for this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The troubled community of Mandalay, which has been campaigning on the arrears and service delivery, is also discussed. Mr Boraine observes that there has to be caution in dealing with individual communities in an ad-hoc (there's that word again) way, but adds that the council should be able to respond speedily to some relatively straightforward demands. He also suggests that the council should become more pro-active in anticipating community needs to avoid confrontations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not saying we mustn't move swiftly to meet the challenges but our job as strategic managers is to go beyond the ad-hoc approach, the pressure cooker approach. We must respond in the context of similar demands from other areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 11 am we're into a debate on housing. There is agreement that the team will have to set extra time aside to focus on this important issue to begin to formulate a housing strategy for the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around noon, lunch is wheeled in but there's only time to grab a plate and continue the meeting, which ends with a quick briefing by Mr Lever on an Olympic funding conundrum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1pm, the troops have rallied and four of the executive directors meet outside the civic centre. Mr Boraine remains behind because he's technically on paternity leave (as the proud father of a week-old son). This afternoon the team are off to Mitchell's Plain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cape Town municipality is being hammered for doing nothing to prevent carnage on the notorious death bend at the bottom of Kloof Nek Road in Tamboerskloof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing demands by residents for something to be done about the corner, scene of many accidents, have been held up by red tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a huge truck carrying building material ploughed into cars and garden walls at the weekend, injuring several people and causing the temporary closure of the road, Tamboerskloof people are demanding urgent action by the council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A stumbling-block to proposed changes to the road system was the restructuring of local government and the resultant rapid loss of staff, a spokesman for the municipal roads department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two possible plans, each costing more than R1-million, would be put to the public for a decision, and it was unlikely that construction would go ahead this year, said Leon Bester, Cape Town municipality's assistant city engineer for roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crash caused traffic mayhem for hours, as officials tried to clear the scene and restore order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadly bend at the intersection has been a hot topic for years, and plans to remove the danger have been in the pipeline since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two proposals by the roads department were approved by the provincial roads engineer last April but a decision had not been taken on which was the better, said Mr Bester. It was decided to involve the public in the decision and meetings with the community would be held this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He could not say what progress had been made on this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first proposal was to widen New Church Street into a two-way street where it splits into Upper Buitengracht and the second was to improve the alignment of Upper Buitengracht and Kloof Nek Road to remove the dangerous 90- degree bend where most of the accidents happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both plans found favour with the provincial roads engineer, but both would require the acquisition of property,&quot; Mr Bester said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of safety, the changes are needed. It is a question of which scheme is favoured by the public and it is hoped the public participation exercise would be concluded this year,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calls for the intersection to be changed have been made since 1988 when there were two accidents in which cars went out of control, one of them hitting a bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five people were killed and at least 10 were injured in the accidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another incident in November 1991, an out-of-control, rubble-laden lorry swept through the intersection and hit five cars, injuring four people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 1992, the then Cape Town City Council's planning committee proposed a plan to alleviate the problem, which involved acquiring seven flats, a cafe, a bottle store and a restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It involved a partial straightening of the &quot;dog-leg&quot; turns motorists have to make when going from Kloof Nek Road via Burnside Road into Upper Buitengracht Street.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON (PANA) - A tight schedule awaited Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe when he arrived in London on Monday, with the most important of his engagements being the keynote address at the Zimbabwe investment conference to be held in two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heading a powerful delegation comprising eight cabinet ministers and at least 50 top industrialists and business persons, he is expected to articulate measures taken by government to improve the investment environment in his country since the last investment conference in London, in 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 300 British companies have total investments of about 636 million U.S.  dollars in Zimbabwe, accounting for about 50,000 jobs. Of this investment, about 909 million dollars was realized after 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain remains the largest foreign investor in Zimbabwe and is the country's biggest export market and second largest source of imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe is scheduled to have lunch Wednesday with Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace and hold talks Thursday with Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary Malcom Rifkind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, he will also hold a meeting with London-based heads of missions of member countries of the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa says it will investigate media claims that South African arms sold to Uganda in 1996 were now being used by southern Sudanese anti-government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunday Independent newspaper claimed that South African weapons, including armored vehicles, were in the possession of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not dismiss the reports,&quot; Conventional Arms Control Committee Chairman Kadar Asmal said Sunday. &quot;The South African government takes these kind of allegations seriously and we will certainly investigate this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the government had investigated similar allegations three or four times and &quot;found them to be without any basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper report quoted a source in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, as saying reports from southern Sudan revealed that anti-tank missiles and a mine-clearer of South African origin were being used by the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asmal described the report as sensationalist, pointing out that the newspaper conveniently used an unnamed Ugandan source. &quot;The story is irresponsible and injures our reputation as a responsible arms exporter,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Uganda was a reforming country, and that South Africa had only sold offensive weapons to it -- including troop carriers, mine-clearers and machine guns -- as needed by any government. The Ugandan government knew it had to adhere to the end-user certificate which laid down certain rules and regulations regarding responsible use of the weapons received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that it would be easy for South Africa to determine whether Uganda had breached the end-user certificate. If this were so, said, it would have very serious diplomatic implications for the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uganda is much too responsible for this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - As Zimbabwe prepares to host the 10th Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in June, bullish animal rights groups in Western countries are on the offensive against the country's attempts to lobby for resumption in ivory trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups, who claim to be saviours of wildlife, even attempted to convince about 1,500 delegates from 136 countries to move the conference from Zimbabwe to another country which supports the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have even extended their pressure to influence donors and Western governments to cut aid to countries defying their dictates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, local wildlife experts accuse the groups of putting animals before human beings by imposing strict protectionist measures at the expense of the welfare of the people and the ecosystems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of concern to Zimbabwe is the 1989 ban on international trade in ivory which has also affected Botswana and Namibia, with equally huge populations of elephants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three countries have in the past unsuccessfully lobbied for the downgrading of the elephant from Appendix I which bans any trade to Appendix II which allows for regulated trade under strict conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lifting of the ban during the conference would enable Zimbabwe to resume trade of its stockpile of 40 tons of ivory. This would fetch millions of dollars which could benefit the cash-strapped National Parks Department and help fund other government social welfare programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most vocal opponents of Zimbabwe's lobby is Species Survival Network, a consortium of over 30 non-governmental organizations and leading animal rights groups active worldwide, whose principal function is be to ensure that the 1989 ban stays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This they will seek to achieve not by calm reasoning but by whipping up public anger to such a fever pitch that would-be traders will need skins like bull elephant hide if they remain stout in their resolve,&quot; warns Africa Resources Trust, a locally-based Southern Africa Conservation Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, local conservationists and government argue that elephants in most of Southern Africa are not an endangered species and are in fact a danger to the environment and human life because of their large and increasing number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) Director Taparendava Maveneke says although elephants in Africa are not healthy in numbers, Southern African countries' elephant populations are increasing to the extent of threatening the survival of other wild species and the whole ecosystem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 65,000, Zimbabwe carries twice the number of elephants it can handle at its optimum level of 35,000. Because of their large numbers, the animals have become a menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are being trampled to death or left maimed for life. Crops and the natural vegetation is destroyed while homes are damaged. As a result people live in constant fear of the animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maveneke said the groups who practice &quot;environmental colonialism&quot; still regard the concept of a dark Africa where Western &quot;romanticists&quot; disguised as tourists visit to have a taste of the &quot;wilderness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Western romanticism to equate people with animals and they say culling is inhuman because they just want to come here to take photographs of our wildlife and get satisfied while local people are denied of a source of income,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups, he added, use the political vote in their countries to influence their governments to withdraw support to organizations which they label as supporters of the killing of animals as if it is murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wildlife experts say since the ban on ivory trade, Zimbabwe has lost 29 million U.S. dollars in revenue and continues to lose 44 million dollars annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africans are sitting on a huge wealth they cannot market because some Western organizations prioritized animals before humans,&quot; Maveneke said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In desperation, one of the groups is funding a pioneer project in South Africa to control elephant populations through contraception as a humane alternative to culling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people are crazy,&quot; said a Harare-based conservationist. &quot;They know that the elephant population is highly unacceptable, but do not want Africans to derive benefits from them and recommend birth control pills rather than simply culling the animals for economic gains.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July Moyo, the secretary for environment and tourism said: &quot;Our message is sovereign countries must be free to decide what to do with their own resources rather than leaving a group of people to impose their own ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several organizations, including the O.A.U. the Non-Aligned Movement, the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Conference have called for the sanctions to be lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In financial terms, Montaser estimated the effects of the sanctions to be in the billions of dollars. &quot;The aggravation has been in the health sector with more people dying because they cannot get medical attention abroad,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a shortage of medical supplies putting to risk the health of Libya's 4.8 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montaser said the rate of rood accidents had risen resulting in at least 2, 000 deaths since the sanctions were imposed in 1992. Justice Minister Ibrahim Bakir died four years ago in a car accident on the Tripoli-Djerba road, on his way to Tunisia for a conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the embargo has not affected the quantity of Libyan oil, which has an OPEC quota of 1.2 million barrels of crude a day, Montser said production has become more expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that production could be affected in future if the sanctions, which ban importation of required equipment for the oil industry, were not lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Libya's international image, he said it was obvious his country had been misunderstood by many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we don't care,&quot; he said. &quot;Understanding people depends on the frame of reference. They hate you whatever you do. Form an opinion and they will not charge their mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the apparent lack of opposition in Libya, he said the Libya political system was based on one of city states as existed in Athens in ancient Greece.  This works through 380 assemblies where people air their views at the local congress and through their representatives at the national congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montaser recommended the system to the rest of Africa, in place of what he said was the failed political party system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Tripoli meeting, at which he was elected chairman, Montaser said it was a success. The meeting, the first major one since the imposition of the United Nations sanctions, brought together some 43 ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a message of the people who meddle in the affairs of Africa that Libya has done what is required of her and that a fair solution should be acceptable to the problem of Lockerbie for the sanctions to be lifted,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Liberian Foreign Minister Monie Captan says the march to peace in his war-torn country is irreversible and nothing should be done to derail the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Previous peace plans never achieved disarmament but thanks of Ecomog (the West African peace monitoring force in Liberia), one will say that 90 percent success has been achieved in the programme set out by the Abuja peace accord, &quot;the minister told PANA in Tripoli, Libya, where he attended the just-ended 65th OAU ministerial council meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must maintain the schedule, it will be dangerous to let this chance slip, &quot;said Captan, a political science lecturer at Monrovia University before the war broke out seven years ago in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expressing optimism over what has been achieved, he said, however, that &quot; after a seven-year war, we may not have a perfect election, but it is a beginning of the return of stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abuja peace plan provides for national election in Liberia on May 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captan said one of the paramount concerns of his transition government was the repatriation and rehabilitation of Liberian refugees who fled from the war that has killed more than 150,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are 2.5 million and 800,000 are outside Liberia as refugees. Holding a national election with that number of persons outside the country is worrisome, &quot;the minister added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed to the international community to assist in efforts to repatriate the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captan, 35, who was first nominated into the Liberian cabinet as minister of state for presidential affairs in 1995 by the ULIMO faction, is in the current interim government as a representative of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted the tribal factor did fuel, but was never the cause of the war in his country, which in July marks the 150th anniversary of independence, as Africa's oldest republic. Liberia was founded by freed slaves from America in 1847.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captan said liberians looked forward to a leader who would mould the country's various ethnic groups together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our basic concern is the question of national reconciliation and unification, &quot;he said, adding that this called for efforts to ensure ethnic and geographical balance in the future Liberian army, police and in all spheres of governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need a government of inclusion, power sharing and equity,&quot; Captan noted.  Referring to the disappointment of Liberians at the lukewarm attitude of he United States in accelerating the Liberian peace process, the minister said the war had taught his people a big lesson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The war has allowed Liberians to appreciate that it has been Africans that have come to their rescue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While sounding appreciative towards America's support for Ecomog, Captan said in the search for solutions to their future problems, Liberians would be &quot;looking towards Africa and not the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister was optimistic that once peace has been restored, Liberia could rise and play a key role in Africa.&quot;War does not destroy a people's history,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Nigeria has suspended its technical assistance to Zambia over Lusaka's condemnation of Abuja's alleged human rights violations, it was reliably learnt here on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's foreign affairs ministry spokesperson, Chimbala Meleka, confirmed to PANA on Monday that Nigeria had already withdrawn more than 70 nationals working in the Southern African country under its technical Aid corps scheme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff withdrawn include 37 science teachers, 10 medical doctors, eight pharmacists and 19 nurse tutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meleka said that the Nigerian military government was not happy with Zambia's stand at the last United Nations General Assembly, where Lusaka voted for a resolution condemning Nigeria's alleged human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign ministry spokesperson said that Nigeria had officially informed Zambia of the suspension of aid to Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may be aware Zambia, has been consistent with her stand concerning human rights violation in Nigeria. Apart from the UN meeting, Zambia had also in 1995 at the Commonwealth Summit, in New Zealand, strongly condemned Nigeria's human rights abuses and this has displeased Nigeria which is now hitting back on Zambia,&quot; Meleka told PANA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - Tanzania recorded a trade deficit of USD 21.1 million in January 1997, reflecting a decrease of 77.8 percent when compared with the deficit of USD 94.9 million recorded during the corresponding month last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The improvement in the trade account was due to an increase in export earnings, reinforced by a decrease in the import bill during the month, according to the Bank of Tanzania review for January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Export earnings during the month amounted to USD 100 million, 62.4 percent higher than USD 61.6 million recorded the same month last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good performance of both traditional and non-traditional exports accounted for the increased earnings, according to the review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditional export receipts recorded an increase of 38.9 percent, from USD 47.7 million in January, 1996 to USD 66.2 million during the period under review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase was largely on account of higher export volumes of traditional crops, chiefly coffee, cotton, sisal, tea, tobacco and cashew nuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All categories of non-traditional exports, with the exception of petroleum products, registered increases when compared with their respective levels recorded in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On imports, the bank's review shows that the import bill for January 1997 dropped by 22.6 percent for USD 121.1 million in comparison to USD 156.5 million incurred in January 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All imports during the months of either capital goods, intermediate or consumer goods, decreased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capital goods went down by 26.5 percent, from USD 63 million to USD 46.3 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While intermediate goods contracted by 19.8 percent from USD 53.9 million to USD 43.2 million, the bill for consumer goods diminished by 20.8 percent from USD 39.9 million to USD 31.6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, capital goods continued to dominate the import sector with a 39.2 percent share of the total bill. Intermediate and consumer goods categories followed, with 35.7 percent and 26.1 percent shares respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Tanzanians had to dig deeper into their pockets in January as consumer prices shot up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Consumer Price Index shows prices rose by 5.9 percent during the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Annual rate of inflation dropped from 15.4 percent in December 1996, to 14 percent in January 1997. The decline was mainly due to relatively low price changes in food items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The food group index accounts for 71 percent of total weight in the consumer basket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rents group recorded the highest growth of 27.5 percent followed by furniture and household equipment and recreation and entertainment which registered increases of 19.6 percent and 18.2 percent respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lowest rates of less than 10 percent increases were in miscellaneous goods and services, education and household operations and maintenance groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Bank of Tanzania review for January, the rate of inflation for the year ending the same month represents an improvement of 11.1 percentage points if compared with the inflation rate of 25.1 percent in January, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In view of the anti-inflationary monetary and fiscal policy measures being pursued by the central bank and the government, the inflation rate is expected to decelerate to 10 percent by end of June this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - A record 43 ministers attended the just-ended 65th ministerial council meeting in Tripoli, which hosted the first of such sessions to be held outside the Addis Ababa-based headquarters of the Organization of African Unity (O.A.U).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Libyans, the presence of an estimated 2,000 people in their capital was a comforting relief from the international isolation arising from United Nations sanctions, which have been on since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most delegates commended Tripoli for its near-flawless organisation of the five-day meeting, after an O.A.U summit at the same venue twice failed to hold in 1982 for lack of quorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, beyond the impressive attendance and the predictable expression of solidarity with Libya, it is arguable whether or not the meeting managed to scratch, even superficially, Africa's many daunting political and socio- economic problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While previous such sessions were devoted to the continental body's budgetary and administrative issues, the Tripoli meeting was from the onset bogged down by political crises, especially the the grave situation in eastern Zaire. Parties to the dispute, mainly Zaire and its neighbors Rwanda and Uganda, came prepared, yielding no ground to pleas from other delegates for caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conflict, which continues to produce refugees and other related humanitarian and security problems, has so far defied sub-regional and international mediation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Tripoli meeting was in progress, South Africa was hosting Zaire rebel leader Laurent Kabila. This infuriated Zaire which called it a &quot; legitimization&quot; of the rebellion. Zaire maintained this posture despite assurances to the council by South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo that Pretoria had no intention of undermining the continent's efforts to solve the Great Lakes dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After angry exchanges between concerned delegates, the council in its final declaration chose the easy way out by urging cessation of hostilities in the region. It also called on all &quot;foreign troops including mercenaries&quot; to pull out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, by far the only consensus on the matter was the council's decision to convene an extra-ordinary summit of the O.A.U.'s Central Organ on Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution to address the issue. That summit takes place in Lome, Togo, March 25-26. The event should involve all parties to the dispute as well as countries and organizations that have been involved in peacemaking effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Burundi, the council endorsed the submission of the country's foreign minister, Luc Rukingana, that the sanctions imposed on his country be lifted, because of the progress in restoring peace in the country, since the July 1996 coup that returned Maj. Pierre Buyoya to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Council also noted the progress in Liberia and Sierra Leone but urged that the peace efforts in the West African countries sustained to stem possible return to hostilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly with Angola, council appealed to the international community to continue providing humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unita and the Luanda government were also urged to move faster at forming a government of national unity to end the 30-year-old civil strife in the country. Not much could be said on the horn of Africa, with Somalia's seat still vacant at the O.A.U. However, the factions were asked to abandon hostility and seek peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morocco also remains absent from the O.A.U. over the body's recognition of Western Sahara as a state called the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Rabat pulled out of the continental body because of this recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, following the re-establishment of Morocco's relations with Ethiopia -- which recognizes the Sahrawi, O.A.U. officials expressed hope that Rabat would rejoin the continental body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As expected, the council declared its strong support for Libya and urged the lifting of the U.N. sanctions on the north African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the financial level, the O.A.U. secretariat was richer by some three million U.S. dollars. This came in contributions paid by members in what has become a practice by members to pay during scheduled meetings to avoid sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But observers denounced the practice, which they said often starved the body of needed funds to carry out its obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As at the last count, the organisation was still owed some 36 million dollars in outstanding contributions. Its Special Peace Fund has only three million dollars left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting again exposed the division among members when it comes to presenting a common front. In elections at international organizations, such as the International Civil Aviation Association, where Africa was expected to present a common candidate, several countries chose to forward individual candidates with the likelihood that none would get the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial crisis of the Pan African News Agency also came up for discussion. O.A.U. Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim informed council that the Dakar-based news agency could fold anytime due to non-payment of contributions, with arrears totalling some 30 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting ended after fixing its next session in May, ahead of the O.A.U.  's 33rd summit in Harare, Zimbabwe, June 2-4.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - A total of 182 state-owned enterprises were divested in Ghana by the end of last year, Siegfried Sedziefa, Public Relations Manager of the Divestiture Implementation Committee, said in Accra Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the Ghana News Agency (GNA) at the committee's stand at the Indutech '97 fair grounds, Sedziefa said 18 of the divested companies were joint ventures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the divestiture programme is an ambitious attempt to inject private capital and technology into the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also to reduce the size of public sector and improve the performance of SOEs by mobilizing private sector management. He said Ghanaian and foreign firms not on the register were being invited to participate in the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such firms should submit the full name of their firms, addresses and contact details, date of establishment, and list of directors and shareholders or partners, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They should also submit the names and addresses of bankers and auditors, and a statement of their firm's capabilities. The applications are to be submitted with a non-refundable fee of 50,000 cedis for Ghanaian companies and 100,000 dollars for foreign companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sedziefa said successful firms would be invited for negotiations, adding that consultancy was available.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Gold production in Zimbabwe exceeded two tons in January amid signs that the price of the yellow mineral has begun to rise after falling to an all-time low in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Production figures for February were still being compiled, but an official at the Chamber of Mines said on Tuesday it would not be surprising if output was better than the same month in 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fall in the gold price, which at one stage sunk to a low of 337 U.S.  dollars, has been blamed for the marginal increase in output registered in the country in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures released last week showed that gold production in 1996 reached 24.7 tons worth 276 million dollars, compared with 24.34 tons mined in 1995, then valued at 236 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official of the Chamber of Mines said latest market intelligence showed that the gold price had recovered from its depressed levels in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is improving and like last year, nobody knows why it is going up just as nobody really knew why it dropped last year,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There must be a reason but it is not readily apparent,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decline in the gold price in 1996 resulted in many mines in Zimbabwe scaling-down operations so to cut costs and remain profitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A leading producer, Falgold, recently told shareholders that it had been forced to curtail operations because of the impact of the low price.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - If out-spoken Libyan leader Muammar Khadafi had his way, Africa would have little or nothing to do with the West for enslaving the black man and refusing to respect his dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He considers as sheer arrogance the unending tension between the white people and their black counterparts over genetic supremacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Often people talk about a white cow and a black cow but they all produce white milk,&quot; the Libyan leader told delegates at the just ended 65th O.A.U.  ministerial council meeting during a banquet he hosted for them in Tripoli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has nothing but contempt for racist apostles, saying the notion had a historical background in the colonization of Africa by European countries.  And despite all pretensions to the contrary, Khadafi says this obnoxious concept has refused to disappear.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The West views us as slaves only because of our dark or black complexion,&quot; he said. &quot;The racists have not rid themselves of this mentality and this will not change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Libyan leader would turn to the O.A.U. Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim and remind him the &quot;colonial masters want us to wear ties and suits to make us acceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the hostile mentality,&quot; he said, &quot;they continue to persist in trying to dominate and subjugate others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the outside world, Khadafi cuts the figure of a controversial and largely misunderstood leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1969 revolution that swept him to power with a government of socialist coloration put him at loggerheads with the West, which accuses Libya of exporting terrorism. Also mooted is the allegation out of fear in European capitals that Tripoli could spread islam at a rate that posed a threat to Western ideals and democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tension between Khadafi and the West aggravated with the collapse of the Soviet Union, a former ally. Yet the Libyan leader is unbowed and says he owes the West no apology for practicing a system of government he considers best suited to his people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system, laid out in his 139-page &quot;Green Book,&quot; deals with &quot;solution of economic problems of socialism&quot; and the &quot;social basis of the third universal theory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the three-part volume, Khadafi argues that most political systems in the world today were dictatorships &quot;under the cover of false democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Libyan leader is never minces words in his condemnation of what he considers the duplicity by the West. His two hour speech was no exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Authority&quot;, he said &quot;derives from the people,&quot; adding that there was no justification for Western countries that practice largely two party systems of government to &quot;impose multiparty system on Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said &quot;America with about 250 million people operates a two-party system, the same with Britain, but they want Zaire, Algeria (with smaller population), to have many parties with every tribe struggling to have its own party.&quot; The result was anarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I challenge anyone to interfere and ask America or Britain to change their systems of government,&quot; he said. &quot;We are not teenagers for the U.S. to come and solve our problems in Somalia and Liberia,&quot; he warned, adding that America created the crises in the first peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khadafi said &quot;Africans must solve Africa's problem and we must shut the door on external interference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tripoli remains geographically close but politically far from Europe, and this, at great cost to Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How long the country and its people can withstand the orchestrated Western propaganda and virulent onslaught remains to be seen. The question of succession also remains unresolved for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, Libya manifests no visible opposition to the leader of the 1969 revolution, but experts on North African politics postulate that what becomes of the oil-rich country after khadafi could be anybody's guess in a unipolar world where the U.S. is the sole superpower.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The government of Zaire called today for the urgent implementation of a UN peace plan calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of foreign forces from its soil. A government statement in Kinshasa urged the United Nations to immediately send in international monitors to oversee the withdrawal of foreign troops. The statement followed an announcment in Paris by Zaire's Foreign Minister Gerard Kamanda Wa Kamanda that President Mobutu Sese Seko and the Zairean government had accepted a peace plan proposed by Mohamed Sahnoun, Joint OAU/UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace plan was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council on February 18 (see IRIN Update 104). The five points call for:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">o immediate cessation of hostilities o withdrawal of all external forces, including mercenaries o reaffirmation of respect for the national sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Zaire and other states of the Great Lakes region o protection and security for all refugees and displaced persons and facilitation of access for humanitarian assistance o rapid and peaceful settlement of the crisis through dialogue, the electoral process and the convening of an international conference of peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Regional Humanitarian Coordinators Office (RHCO) in Nairobi reports only 9 UN staff are affected by the expulsion order in Zaire, out of the 19 who were evacuated from Kisangani to Kinshasa on Saturday, March 1. According to RHCO, the government order affects UN staff who were based in Kisangani and not those who were on temporary mission. Earlier reports from Kinshasa that three international staff had already left by barge were proved unfounded. International staff affected are preparing to leave. Two NGO members potentially affected by the expulsion statement from the Zairean government said today their organisations had received no direct order to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Humanitarian sources report that some local staff left in Kisangani have resigned from international organisations over the last few days because they feel &quot;vulnerable to be associated with the UN&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A government statement broadcast by Zairean state radio said that 25,000 civilians have been murdered since the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) took over Tingi-Tingi camps in eastern Zaire. According to the government statement, broadcast yesterday, the &quot;precipitous departure of these humanitarian workers from the Tingi-Tingi camp and the town of Kisangani.....is considered by the government to be directly responsible for the slaughter which took place in less than 48 hours&quot; . There has been no independent confirmation of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNICEF is &quot;extremely concerned&quot; about some 600 children who were on therapeutic feeding before Tingi-Tingi camps dispersed, and another 2,500 on supplementary feeding. Journalists reported on Monday refugees heading towards Kisangani, some 150 kilometers west of the provincial capital - but said the leaders of the column were the fittest. Pictures of refugees on the road show them with swollen feet and in poor condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Quoting a regional military source - who has provided accurate information on rebel movements to date - Reuters says that the ADFL are beseiging Kisangani on three fronts, and that the city could fall in days.  The source said rebels were within range of Kisangani on two axis beyond the northern town of Bafwasende, and also advancing on the Lubutu-Kisangani road.  The source said the rebels were also gaining ground in mineral-rich Shaba province, with recent gains in Kabolo and Manono - where the ADFL reportedly encounter little resistence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Defeated Zairean soldiers surrendered their weapons to rebels today in Kindu, as the ADFL began setting up a new administration, reports Reuters from Kindu. The capture of Kindu last week gives the rebels a key transport hub on the Zaire river and the northernmost working station on a rail line to South Africa. It also has a large airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* At least twenty people have died in two separate attacks in Rwanda since last week, report AFP. In the first attack, in Rushashi area near Kigali, ten people died and 21 were injured (see IRIN Update 116). A second attack took place on Sunday or Monday in the northwest region of Ruhengeri, aid officials said. Radio Rwanda did not report the two attacks but broadcast death notices that included one family losing four sons and another eight of its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to a report by the United Nations Human Rights Operation in Rwanda, the human rights situation in Rwanda has &quot;drastically deteriorated&quot; since the begining of January 1997 - following the repatriation of more than a million people, many of whom were believed to be directly involved in the 1994 genocide. In January, UNHRFOR received reports of the killings of at least 424 persons in 55 incidents; the report said it &quot;represented the highest number of killings since the begining of 1996&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, the human rights situation is particularly bad in the four prefectures bordering Zaire. In January, of the 424 reported killings, 311 took place in the four prefectures bordering Zaire. Of the 311 killings, 228 were reported in the Ruhengeri Prefecture. According to UNHRFOR, the 424 victims included 78 returnees, 40 genocide survivors and their associates, 14 detainees, and 13 local officials. In January, at least 163 of the 424 killings were reported to be the responsibility of the state, including members of the RPA; 42 were attributed to members of the ex-FAR and militia. UNHRFOR said the deteriorating security situation had also been marked by number of fatal attacks against expatriates working in Rwanda, including the killing of five UNHRFOR staff members, and that human rights activities had been &quot;drastically reduced&quot;. UNHRFOR said it had been unable to carry out full monitoring activities during the reporting period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The return of all-rounder Brian McMillan and the addition of a second spinner, most likely Pat Symcox, are vital if South Africa are to have any chance of bouncing back in the series after yesterday's devastating innings and 196-run defeat to Australia in the first test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's heaviest loss in the post-isolation era should not provoke panic within Peter Pollock's selection panel, because wholesale changes are not the answer in preventing another whitewash in the second test starting in Port Elizabeth next Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the batting badly needs some stability and the attack needs more variety on a St George's Park pitch which promises to be of even less help to South Africa's pacemen than the Wanderers was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMillan, who missed the first test because of an ankle injury, will have to prove his fitness for Western Province in their Supersport Series match against Natal at Newlands this weekend and should he come through, the selectors shouldn't hesitate to recall him at the expense of Jonty Rhodes at No 6.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMillan, with a test average of 42, as opposed to Rhodes' 30, has played a stabilising role in the middle-order, although he has not been comfortable against spin in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top-order, though, is as unsettled as it's ever been. The form of Gary Kirsten is a big worry, and the question of whether to stick with Andrew Hudson or give Adam Bacher a run wasn't resolved at the Wanderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacques Kallis, who top-scored with a three-hour 39 in South Africa's disastrous second-innings of 130, deserves a run at No 3 for the remainder of the series but it may take some time for him to take that step up another level. The big mistake the selectors made was not to choose him for the home series against India to allow him to settle into the pivotal position ahead of the tougher Australian contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bacher was chosen at No 3 against India but opening is his preferred role and long-term destiny. Had Kallis been given a decent run instead in a position which has been earmarked for him for some time, the top-order may have had a more solid look by now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the series, many observers believed South Africa had the edge in the pace department but on pitches lacking pace and bounce, that perceived advantage - and Australia's Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie were certainly more disciplined at the Wanderers - is negated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless the St George's Park pitch for the second test plays markedly out of character, another spinner in tandem with Paul Adams would seem a necessity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Symcox would turn the ball away from the Australian left- handed batsmen might give him the nod for what would be his first test at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a good case for Transvaal's Clive Eksteen, the leading wicket- taker in provincial competition this season with 36 scalps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second spinner would have to come in at the expense of either Shaun Pollock or Lance Klusener, both of whom lacked variation at the Wanderers.  Pollock also seems to have lost a yard of pace since returning from an ankle injury at the beginning of the season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both cases, though, the South African selectors should reverse their decision to rest them from the Natal side to play Western Province. They may have to put in noteworthy performances at Newlands to guarantee their test places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Fanie de Villiers might be a long shot because he has been out with injury for several weeks, his cunning swing bowling, experience and ability to conjure something out of nothing was the kind of variation which was lacking at the Wanderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should he play for Northern Transvaal against Transvaal at Centurion Park this weekend - Northerns had not yet finalised their side - then the selectors should at least monitor his fitness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this stage of the series, the United Cricket Board must be wishing they had scheduled a test at Kingsmead where South Africa's pacemen may have had a chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, though, this Australian team looked so accomplished in all departments of the game during the past five days that the condition of the pitch seems irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as the Australians are concerned Shane Warne's four-wicket haul at the Wanderers in his 50th test match should leave few in doubt that the masterful leg-spinner is almost back to his best after finger surgery last year had left his career in the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the Australians arrived in this country, doubts were raised in South Africa as to whether Warne was the same bowler as the cocky magician who weaved his spell to take 33 wickets in six tests against Kepler Wessels' team in 1993-94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he took 22 wickets in five tests against the West Indies this season, he hadn't taken the spectacular seven or eight-wicket hauls which had been his hallmark. But the only reason he didn't take a bagful at the Wanderers yesterday was because his spin partner Michael Bevan was &quot;taking a lot of Shane's wickets at the tail&quot; as Aussie captain Mark Taylor put it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bevan may have wrapped up the tail in next to no time but Warne snared the big fish using his full array of tricks with his leg-break, wrong-un, top- spinner and flipper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Metropolitan Life chairman Nthato Motlana yesterday hit back at criticism that he and other blacks in high profile positions had not done enough for advancing black empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at Metropolitan Life's (Metlife) annual meeting, Dr Motlana pointed out that 38 percent of Metlife's middle management was black - substantially higher than any other company in the South African financial services sector.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to this, he said, 20 percent of Metlife's senior management and 57 percent of supervisory management was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not only the highly visible positions where we are seeking black incumbents, but at every level of decision-making in our business,&quot; Dr Motlana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metlife had also been the financier of three black businesses within the National Empowerment Consortium, which acquired Anglo American's 35 percent stake in Johnnic last October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Motlana sharply criticised the country's efforts in curtailing Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will tell you quite openly that I am appalled by the paucity of this country's effort in countering Aids. I am referring not only to Government, but also to our NGOs and the private sector. Neither sufficient money nor attention is being given to the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also criticised the proposed legislation to prohibit the pre-employment test for HIV infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My quarrel is that the proposed Act is rather short-sighted in its thinking. Such legislation will only entrench the stigmatisation of Aids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said HIV-infected persons were already sufficiently protected by the Labour Relations Act which specified that employers may not unfairly discriminate against job applicants with disabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is clear that most HIV-infected persons can remain healthy for a significant period of time and cannot, therefore, be prohibited from working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Motlana was, however, not opposed to pre-benefit medical testing for staff benefits, such as group life insurance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Controversial sex offender Dennis Hundermark, deported from Britain and now in Cape Town, cannot be deported as he has South African citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department of Home Affairs spokesman Hennie Meyer confirmed Mr Hundermark's citizenship, but said he could be extradited if a warrant for his arrest was issued in another country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hundermark was not wanted on a warrant elsewhere, said Superintendent Jan Swart, head of the Child Protection Unit in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British authorities did not release Mr Hundermark from prison in order to deport him, said Andrew Noble, British High Commission press spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hundermark had completed about half of his 16-month sentence in Britain for a sex-related offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was granted the normal remission of sentence for the remaining eight months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had been kept in custody for several months while he was awaiting trial and this period counted as part of the sentence, Mr Noble said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hundermark was arrested in June, convicted on November 1 and released on February 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was deported to South Africa on the recommendation of the trial judge.  Hundermark holds dual South African and Zimbabwean citizenship and he elected to be returned to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His deportation from Britain was standard procedure for a non-citizen who had committed a crime and had completed his sentence, Mr Noble said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Traffic systems in Cape Town's City Bowl area need to be reviewed urgently if such serious hazards as the dreaded intersection of New Church Street and Kloof Nek Road are to be eliminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the view of Democratic Party city councillor Belinda Walker, who serves on the urban planning committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said upgrading the intersection had been the ward's priority for years, but no solution had been found.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest accident at the weekend, a heavily laden lorry smashed into cars and walls near the intersection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The municipality has been accused of dragging its feet on the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two proposals for upgrading the intersection were approved by the provincial roads engineer last April. Almost a year later, a public meeting is planned to discuss them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first proposal is that Kloof Nek Road and Upper Buitengracht Street be realigned to ease the 90-degree bend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second involves widening New Church Street for two-way traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many top civil engineers in Cape Town were available to undertake the urgent work immediately, said Hillel Turok of the Camps Bay Ratepayers Association's planning committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This horrible corner is a longstanding problem and creates a bumper-to- bumper build-up every morning and every evening. Council must stop dragging its feet and do the job,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He questioned the need to consult residents on the proposals, as people generally were not authorities on road planning and for this reason, civil engineers should look into the plans, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leon Markovitz, chairman of the municipality's urban planning committee, said something needed to be done urgently about the intersection, but there were many other problem spots in Cape Town, especially in areas where money had not been spent on traffic control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been in a political situation of change, and while this is not necessarily an excuse for a delay, it's not unusual for it to take that period of time,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes an accident like this highlights a particular problem and we need to push it,&quot; said Mr Markovitz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possible solutions to the city's traffic congestion were more parking zones and better-quality public transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a 12-month transportation study of the inner city was due for completion in June, said Basil Tommy, acting planning co-ordinator of the municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, which cost more than R1 million, looked into ways of alleviating traffic congestion and included the use of buses, trains and taxis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; A report in Monday's Cape Argus on the weekend accident at the New Church Street and Kloof Nek Road intersection incorrectly stated that a red Mazda 323 drove the wrong way along a one-way road and crashed into a large truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the truck drove the wrong way down New Church Street and side- swiped the Mazda, said the car's owner, Mary Ann Pote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cape Town is locked in a battle to get its own television station instead of having yet another national station forced down its throat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight is on for the all-important new private television licence, after the Independent Broadcasting Authority this week allocated seven new radio licences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the prospect of a 24-hour regional television station could be lost to the Western Cape if the IBA goes ahead with plans to issue yet another national licence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people of the Western Cape are being asked to rally behind a campaign to persuade the authority that viewers are tired of what is being dished up nationally and want their own station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have less than a fortnight to achieve this, as the authority is to hold hearings in Cape Town later this month to hear objections to its decision to award another national TV licence by October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to go for another national licence is based on &quot;confidential&quot; research which has not been made available to applicants for a regional licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a turnaround from earlier plans to create a network of regional television stations focusing on each of the main urban areas of Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBA co-chairman Peter de Klerk said the debate on whether to opt for national or regional television was still open and a decision would be taken only after representations by interested groups were made at the public hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Me De Klerk said this decision would have to take into account the viability of a national station versus regional ones, as well as the country's growth rate and the amount of money available for advertising support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we are still a long way off making that decision and will start our deliberations only after the public hearings. Then we will draft a policy which will be our point of reference in determining whether a national channel or a network of regional channels is best,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the campaign for a Western Cape TV station is Channel 6, a Cape consortium in which Cape Newspapers holds a share of less than 15 percent, the limit set for cross-media ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A petition to raise support for regional television is to be circulated at the Cape Argus/Pick 'n Pay Cycle Tour on Sunday and the Life Cycle exhibition at the Good Hope Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following weekend, Channel 6 aims to take the campaign to shopping centres, asking Western Cape viewers to make their feelings known to the IBA.  Channel 6 has been established as a company, with backing from Cape-based companies, to bid for a regional licence which ideally would operate 24-hours a day and include prime-time news and actuality programmes covering the Western Cape in Afrikaans, English and Xhosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other components would include entertainment, sport, weather, game shows, drama, business and crime coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Managing director Glynn O'Leary said he believed the only way television could meet the needs of viewers was through regional TV, which would satisfy language demands and increase access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was definitely enough advertising money available to support regional television, which could cater for smaller businesses or companies aiming at specific target markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A requirement of the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act was that bidders for a licence should prove a need, support and demand for a proposed service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign aims to find out whether this is true of the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Amnesty International strongly condemns the execution yesterday of eight men in Libya. The eight people, six senior army officers and two civilians, were executed in the morning of 2 January 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These executions are an outrage,&quot; Amnesty International said today. &quot;From the moment of their arrest more than three years ago their case has been shrouded in secrecy. They have been held in unknown locations all that time, completely cut off from their families and the outside world, and every trial hearing has been held in camera.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six army officers were identified as Colonel Miftah Qarrum al-Wirfalli, Colonel Mostafa Abu al-Qassim Masud al-Kikli, Lieutenant-Colonel Saad Saleh Farag, Major Khalil Salam Mohammad al-Jidiq, Major Mostafa Ihbayl al-Firjani and Major Ramadhan al-Ayhuri. The two civilians were Dr Saad Misbah al-Amin al-Zubaydi and Sulayman Ghayth Miftah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men were reportedly charged with &quot;passing defence secrets to foreign states (the United States of America) &quot; and membership of &quot;a banned organization linked to agents of foreign governments&quot;. This organization is the National Front for the Salvation of Libya -NFSL, the main Libyan opposition group operating in exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court acquitted six other army officers, including Lieutenant-Colonel Mohammad al-Ghul and Flight-Captain Sadeq Shaqluf, and two civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people involved in this case were among dozens arrested and detained in the aftermath of a rebellion by army units around the city of Misrata in October 1993. Three of those executed gave televised &quot;confessions&quot;, reportedly as a result of torture, to being American &quot;spies&quot; in early March 1994. They said they had been recruited as American Intelligence agents by members of the NFSL. Trial before the lower military court reportedly took place at the end of 1995. Amnesty International has also received reports that the Supreme Military Court's verdict was given and video-taped about a month ago, but was not made public until 1 January 1997 when the Libyan television announced the news of the death sentences. Espionage is punishable by death in Libya and so is mere membership of an opposition group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The blanket of secrecy heightens our fears that the basic human rights of these individuals were disregarded from the outset&quot; Amnesty International said. The organization had repeatedly requested information about their legal status and whereabouts and sent urgent appeals after reports were received that they had been tortured, and then sentenced to death. To date no response has been received from the Libyan authorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The Zairean government has issued an expulsion order for United Nations and international NGOs personnel who evacuated on March 1 from their duty station in Kisangani. Humanitarian agencies report in Kinshasa that three international personnel left by barge this morning for Brazzaville; others are on standby. The expulsion, which was ordered yesterday, is being urgently appealed by the UN and NGOs. The UN requested to be notified formally and be given at least 24 hours to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International staff were told that the primary reason given for the expulsion order was the UN's alleged failure to properly notify the Zairean government through &quot;normal diplomatic channels&quot; of its intention to relocate staff from Kisangani. The Minister of the Interior, Eboma Ejuku, said it was an irresponsible action that &quot;sowed the seeds of panic and confusion among the Kisangani population&quot;. According to the Minister, the actions of the UN and the NGOs in recent months had the effect of destabilising local populations to such an extent that it had &quot;encouraged anti-government elements and rebel forces to attack GOZ positions&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior UN officials called on the Governor of Kisangani on Friday (February 28) to explain the decision of the UN to temporarily relocate its staff.  According to the UN, the decision was received &quot;calmly&quot; and the Ministries of Defence, Interior, Foreign Affairs and Prime Ministers Office were consequently verbally notified on March 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Sources in Kinshasa said that the Governor of Kisangani had flown out to Kinshasa today. Journalists report rebels approaching Kisangani from various directions, and say they are within 40 kilometers north of the provincial capital (Bengamisa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has revived the idea of an international military force in eastern Zaire, saying that unless a ceasefire can be secured, the international community should &quot;study the possibility of using troops to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate the refugees&quot;. Annan was speaking at a news conference during a visit to the UN war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia in The Hague. He said it was imperative to apply political pressure for a ceasefire and that &quot;all options&quot; should be considered. Discussions in New York on the possibility of international intervention are continuing today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several countries had planned to send troops to Zaire in November 1996 but military intervention was abandoned when more than a million Rwandan and Burundian refugees repatriated to Rwanda. The United States and Canada, who sent small advance units for logistical reasons, rejected using force as part of a humanitarian mandate - which many observers and aid workers saw as the lack of will to tackle the the root causes of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Journalists who were flown to Kindu by the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) report hundreds of people emerging from forest hideouts, days after Zairean soldiers retreated. The ADFL captured the garrison town of Kindu and its airport. According to the journalists, there were no visible signs of battle at the airport and much of the town was &quot; scarred more by looting than by bullets&quot;. Residents of Kindu said after Zairean troops fled along with five white mercenaries, Kindu was defended by a 177-strong contingent of former Rwandan soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Humanitarian sources in Rwanda say they are unaware of any arrivals of refugees from the dispersed Tingi-Tingi camps in eastern Zaire, some 500 kilometers from the Rwandan border. AP yesterday reported refugees &quot;streaming home&quot; after rebels took over Tingi-Tingi camps - which formerly held some 170, 000 Rwandans. UN agencies and humanitarian sources point out the distance is too great for such an arrival from Tingi-Tingi. A column of refugees from Tingi-Tingi were seen and interviewed by journalists some 150 kilometers from Kisangani on Monday. Another group is heading for Ubundu, to the south, where local officials have directed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected a submission at the just- concluded Tripoli meeting by Burundi's foreign affairs representative, Luc Rukingana, that regional sanctions on Burundi should be lifted because there had been progress in restoring peace. It recommended that the sanctions be reviewed &quot;in the light of progress in the peace process in Burundi&quot;, confirms OAU spokesman Ibrahim Dagash at the OAU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  When asked about the issue of regional sanctions at a press conference, Secretary-General of the OAU, Salim Ahmed Salim, said that sanctions should firmly remain until progress had been made under the conditions imposed by the Regional Sanctions Committee. Regional sanctions were imposed in July 1996 when leader Pierre Buyoya took power by coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A record 43 ministers attended the 65th ministerial council in Tripoli. The African news agency PANA reports that despite &quot;near-flawless organisation&quot; it seemed that the meeting &quot;barely managed to scratch the surface of Africa's many daunting political and socio-economic problems&quot;. The Zairean crisis was high on the agenda, which provoked angry exchanges between delegates, especially concerning the Zairean governments' fury over South African talks &quot; legitimizing the rebellion&quot;. PANA reports that the OAU eventually &quot;took the easy way out&quot; by urging cessation of hostilities in the region, and calling on all foreign troops to pull out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Food and Agriculture Organisation report on the food supply situation and crop prospects in Sub-Saharan Africa ranks Kenya among states with the most unfavourable food conditions. According to the report serious food difficulties are anticipated in the first half of 1997 as a result of failure of the 1996/97 short rains season. In Kenya, the Kenya Red Cross Society yesterday warned that at least 100,000 people in Coast Province alone faced &quot; starvation&quot;, reports the Daily Nation. A disaster officer with the Society told the Daily Nation that the worst-hit areas are Kinango and Samburu in Kwale District.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) rejected calls for a ceasefire yesterday, saying it would continue to fight until the regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko agreed to one-to-one negotiations. Rebel spokesman Kongolo Mwenze said a UN peace plan - accepted yesterday by the government - worked &quot;against&quot; the rebels, reports AFP. Kinshasa yesterday agreed to a five-point peace plan endorsed by the UN Security Council (see IRIN Update 118). The Zairean government also called for international monitors to oversee its implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* News agencies continue to report ADFL rebels are advancing on three fronts towards the provincial capital of Kisangani, eastern Zaire. Rebel radio in Bukavu, eastern Zaire, said yesterday that &quot;the liberation of the town of Kisangani by Laurent Kabila's troops is only a few hours away&quot;. In the recent rapid territorial gains of the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), such rebel announcements have become characteristic of the &quot;psychological&quot; advance on besieged government towns.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* CNN reported today that &quot;there was no evidence&quot; of the massacre of 25,000 civilians and refugees in Tingi-Tingi camps, eastern Zaire, alleged by the government of Zaire on Tuesday. Tingi-Tingi camps held some 170,000 Rwandans before they fled last week. According to the CNN report, fleeing refugees left behind &quot;dozens of the sick and dying&quot; and headed off towards Kisangani and Ubundu. However, some of the most vulnerable refugees left the camp in empty food trucks before the exodus and are being given assitance in Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Humanitarian agencies are &quot;urgently examining&quot; ways in which to resume relief operations for refugees and IDPs in eastern Zaire. A United Nations mission flew yesterday to Kisangani and Punia, accompanied by the Dutch Minister for Development Cooperation, Jan Pronk. Tens of thousands of refugees who dispersed from the Tingi-Tingi camps are expected to arrive in Ubundu, south of Kisangani, after being diverted there by the military.While there is little reliable information available on the whereabouts and welfare of the 170,000 refugees, it was expected that the majority would eventually emerge from the forest and mass along the 150 kilometer eastern bank of the Zaire River between Ubundu and Lowa. This is a densely forested area, and leaves refugees with no real escape route if the rebels are successful in their advance on Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The US state department has expressed extreme concern about alleged rebel threats against humanitarian personnel working in Resettlement Camps in Burundi. It said the threats had to be treated seriously, given recent attacks on NGO personnel in Rwanda and the past killings of ICRC and UNHCR staff in Burundi. A public withdrawal of the threat is being demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Burundi, two people were killed and another went missing in an overnight attack by Hutu rebels in Rumonge in Bururi, southern Burundi, national radio reported on Wednesday. Seven houses were burnt, and ten others looted. Livestock was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In its 65th ministerial meeting in Tripoli, the Organisation of African Unity responded to an appeal from Burundi to lift regional sanctions, with the following draft recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">o Commends the leaders of the countries of the Great Lakes Region and the facilitator of the peace process, Mwalimu Julius Nyrere, for their on going efforts to bring about a peaceful and negotiated settlement to the conflict in (Burundi)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">o Encourages all the parties to the conflict to work towards ending the cycle of violence and unacceptable killings of innocent people including refugees, especially women, children and the elderly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">o Appeals to the countries of the region which imposed sanctions in Burundi to carry out an objective evaluation of the situation prevailing in the country as the result of implementation of the sanctions and to review these sanctions in the light of progress in the peace process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">o Appeals to the International Community to continue to provide relief assistance to Burundi, in order to facilitate the socio-economic development and reconstruction of that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Drought, warfare and disease are keeping food from millions of people in 14 countries, despite the fact cereal production is running at record levels in sub-Saharan Africa, says a report released yesterday by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). It urges donors and relief agencies to secure the speedy delivery of assistance to eastern Zaire, and to continue emergency assistance to returning refugees and displaced persons in Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia and Sierra Leone. On Zaire, the report described the food situation as &quot;desperate&quot;: &quot;Hundreds of thousands of refugees and the local population continue to flee from the conflict and their food and health situation is precarious&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also recommends urgency in doing &quot;everything possible&quot; to aid Rwandese and Burundian refugees displaced by fighting between rebels and government troops. On Rwanda, FAO says production of beans, the staple food crop, dropped by 12%. This drop, coupled by the massive return of more than a million Rwandan former refugees, means one third of the Rwandan population is being fed by relief agencies (about 2.6 million people). In Burundi, FAO says distribution of humanitarian assistance is being hampered by insecurity and fuel shortages following the imposition of regional sanctions in July 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Uganda has sent out an appeal to the internatioanl donors to support more than 2.1 million people faced with starvation. The government has released Ush284 (US$284,000) as an emergency allocation for food, but it is not enough, according to a Ministerial statement in parliament yesterday. The Kenyan Daily Nation reports from Kampala that Ugandan Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Paul Etyang, that a high-level ad hoc committee is looking into the food needs of people affected in 19 districts in the north, north-east and western parts of the country. The areas are affected by drought and insurgence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* About 100 mainly Rwandan refugees are stranded at Wilson Airport, Nairobi, after the Kenyan government refused them entry. Reports in the Daily Nation and Kenya Times say the refugees flew in from Kisangani, eastern Zaire, on Saturday and are being held at the airport departure lounge under armed guard.  The Daily Nations said the UNHCR yesterday dispatched food and blankets to the group, and had been screening for &quot;genuine cases.&quot; More than half the group are women and children. The state-owned Kenya Times said that a church minister and a local businessman were operating a &quot;human trafficking cartel through which refugees fleeing from the trouble spots in the Great Lakes region&quot;. It quoted sources within the Immigration and Police department saying the refugees paid foreign currency to be flown to Nairobi, be provided with fake travel documents, and receive immigration documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred Rwandans from Kisangani and Tingi-Tingi camps have arrived in Kenya (before the dispersal of about 170,000 Rwandans from the camps) over the last few weeks, until the &quot;elite exodus&quot; was exposed in the press last week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - The Ethiopian Journalists Association (EJA) briefed members of the diplomatic corps Monday on the significance of its planned media World Exhibition Project and content of its newly formulated code of ethics'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Kefyalew Azeze, President of EJA, Ato Selishi Tesemma members of executive committee and Ato Tamirat Aseffa member of the organizing committee of the exhibition informed the invited guests at the Axum Hotel that both the code of ethics and the exhibition were believed to accelerate the pace of growth and hence maturity of the profession in Ethiopia. &quot;It will uphold the truth that journalism in the country, which is flourishing thanks to Article 29 of the constitution of the FDRE, will no longer lag behind time,&quot; Ato Kefyalew said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Kefyalew also urged diplomatic missions and other local and international organs to support the exhibition project which is hoped to introduce journalists with the working of media world organizations and equip them with philosophical orientations&quot;. Noting the EJA with all its members is &quot;only a conductor in such a move,&quot; he added: &quot;It is you who can make this a reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the need for the planned exhibition, the speakers said that as the media was being restructured in the interest of the public which is a radical departure from the old practice, Ethiopian journalists should be acquainted with how the system works in practice in other parts of the world.  They also indicated that any party interested in getting involved in such effort may work &quot;hand-in-glove&quot; with EJA. &quot;Thought the idea is that of EJA, we are prepared to share the experience of others. anyone can join us in the realization of the ultimate goal&quot;, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panel members also elaborated at length on the content and objective of the newly formulated code of ethics based on various points raised by the audience.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - &quot;It is now twenty years since my father dropped us at the school&quot; a prosecution witness told yesterday the first Criminal Bench of the Federal High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness, 36, said her father who left them at the gate of the school one day in 1978, never returned home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her testimonies to the court against the former Derg officials, she said somebody called after a month to tell them that he knew the whereabouts of her father, Mengistu Gebre-Hiwot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My uncle and his friends who went out to look for may father did not show up again&quot; she related to the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A piece of paper stating it was decided that the three including her uncle were to be killed for allegedly being members of the Eritrean People Liberation Front(EPLF) was found in 1991 in the former Ministry of Interior, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the army, searched my house and took with them my two sons one night in March 1978, another witness told the court. He was also released after ten days in custody, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them was released after competing his term but his brother, then a second year student in the engineering faculty, was said to have been taken to the headquarters of the Derg, and &quot;we have not even seen his remains,&quot; the 140th witness related to the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My brother said another witness, who was secretary of the then Ethiopian airlines Trade Unions was among those people wanted by the government and was jailed in various prisons including the headquarters of the Derg after he gave himself up to government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since then, I have not seen my brother&quot; said the witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial was adjourned until March 6, 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - Around 1,400 members of 52 basic workers' associations unanimously supported the re-establishment of the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions (CETU) at a meeting held at the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority recreation centre yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union members of Ethiopian Coffee Export Enterprise and Commerce, Technic and Printing Industry were all convinced that the reformation of CETU was vital for the protection of the rights and benefits of Ethiopian workers after elaborate discussion on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Zerihun Atnafu, coordinator of the meeting and vice chairman of the Commerce, Technical and Printing Industry Federation, said that failure of the members of the former CETU to work together in an atmosphere of understanding and properly set time-tables for meeting were some of the causes for the breakup of the organization.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure of the council members of the former CETU to conduct orderly discussions on issues related to relevant labour affairs time and the use of two different scales by the secretariat, which later led to illegal activities, were other reasons which brought about its disintegration, according to Ato Zerihun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With a strong CETU,. it is also possible to be in a strong position to protect the legitimate rights and interests of workers&quot;, Ato Zerihun remarked, and went on to state that the re-establishment of the countrywide organization was thus most essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Kifle Woldemichael, chairman of the audit committee of the commerce, Technical and Industry Workers Associations Federation, on his part said that CETU's future leadership will have the priority task of seeking ways and means of recovering and rehabilitating properties of workers that had either been rendered useless of damaged and looted at various times through still unidentified people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Kifle went on: &quot;The three seats reserved for organized labour in the House of Peoples' Representatives still vacant because CETU does not yet exist&quot;. This, according to him, was the primary reason why major problems facing Ethiopian workers are not brought to the notice of the government and addressed in the way they should under normal circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - Ethiopia's economic reform programme has laid off 15, 460 civil servants of whom 6,397 are now embraced in five safety-net projects, the Minister in Charge of social and Administrative Affairs in the Office of the Prime Minister told the House of Peoples' Representatives yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kebede Tadesse, the minister, said of the total civil servants dismissed from central executive bodies and development agencies, 988 were transferred to federal and regional institutions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the remaining, he said, 4,892 were women and 9,580 men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report Dr. Kebede presented to the house, some 8,075 other workers were also laid off with pre-retirement pension and compensation, that cost the government 30 million birr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kebede, however, said the government has lent 173 million birr in soft loan to those embraced in four transport and one retail trade safety-net projects with some of them now repaying their debts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the number of civil servants in Ethiopia is minimal, persons laid-off owing to the programme account for only 3 per cent, the minister added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kebede said, &quot;the number of lay off and the cost the programme demanded is low when compared to similar measures in Ghana, Uganda and Tanzania.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister admitted that the dismissal had economic, social and psychological impacts on the families of the persons, refuting a statement by a member of the parliament that &quot;institutions have lost able and experienced personnel due to the reform programme&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NELSPRUIT - A review team, made up of outspoken critics of the secret R12,2- billion Dolphin Deal in Mpumalanga will be flying to meet with the Dolphin Group's controversial president, Ketan Somaia in London on Wed-nesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team, which includes former Mpuma-langa Parks Board (MPB) member, Dr John Hanks, Environmental Council chairperson, Dr Sue Hart, prominent conservationist, Rupert Lorimer and provincial environmental affairs MEC, David Mkhwanazi, will attempt to convince Somaia to change ten aspects of his 50-year contract with the Mpumalanga Parks Board (MPB).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Hanks resigned from the MPB in protest to the contract, which was signed by MPB head, Alan Gray without any public consultation in November last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Hart's watchdog Environmental Council was suspended two weeks ago after repeat-edly criticising both the deal and the provincial government's handling of the issue, while Lorimer was sacked as the MEC's personal consultant after he too criticised the deal in public.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contentious deal gives the Dubai-based Dolphin Group all commercial development and transverse rights to six state owned game reserves, the world's second largest canyon at Blyde River Canyon and the historic town of Pilgrim's Rest for 50-years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return, Dolphin has pledged to bankroll the MPB's budget for 50-years, an amount estimated to be worth R12,2-billion. In addition, Dolphin has undertaken to build hotels and other infrastructure in Mpumalanga worth R400- million within the next three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rural communities, land claim activists and conservationists has vehemently objected to the deal, pointing out that at least three of the core development areas have gazetted land claims on them, that affected communities were never consulted and that Dolphin's direct financial contributions will only ever support one small parastatal with under 800 staff members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provincial government conceded last week that there were flaws in both the agreement itself and in the process leading up to it, after initially branding both the deal's critics and the press as reactionary sabotagers over the past two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wish to bring development to Mpumalanga, but at the same time we need to be mandated by the people whose lives we are affecting. We need to be sensitive to local community participation, consultation and empowerment during the process,&quot; said Mkhwanazi on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the government had decided to include some of its most outspoken critics on the team to show how seriously it was taking public concerns - now that it was convinced of their validity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the contract signed last year is legally binding on the MPB, the review team will attempt convince Somaia to renegotiate ten clauses in the 39- page document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include a clause demanding complete secrecy about the deal's specifics for at least 50-years, a 'get out' clause enabling Dolphin to pull out of the deal without any liability should they feel that not enough tourists are visiting the area and a possible increase of MPB directors on the joint venture company which will steer the whole process to ensure more equal representation for the South African public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of independent environmental impact assessments will also be discussed, as will the pending land claims, the lack of local consultation and a time-table for development programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team will also attempt to get Somaia to agree to reduce the period of the contract from 50-years to a lower, renewable, series of contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of &quot;less significant&quot; issues will also be discussed with Somaia, which possibly include his personal legal problems in Kenya, where he stands accused of defaulting on a R35-million tender with the government there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Somaia's refusal to testify before Kenya's Public Accounts Committee about the issue on three separate occasions, a formal recommendation has been tabled in Parliament demanding legislation be passed that the Kenyan government never again do any business with either Somaia or any company associated with him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NELSPRUIT - Mpumalanga's provincial government decided against canceling the controversial R12,2-billion Dolphin Deal because it would have cost almost R250-million in litigation to overturn the 50-year contract between the Mpumalanga Parks Board (MPB) and the Dolphin Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 50-year deal, which created a storm of controversy in the province after details of it were leaked to African Eye News Service last year, gives the Dubai-based Dolphin Group all commercial development and transverse rights to six State owned game reserves, the Blyde River Canyon, Pilgrim's Rest and Loskop Dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal was signed in secret and no affected communities were consulted about the deal, which includes at least three core development areas with gazetted land claims on them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPB only admitted to the deal's existence four weeks after signing it, after media reports divulged the specifics from the 39-page document, but still refuses to discuss the contract's terms in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premier Mathews Phosa said during a television interview on Monday night that the government had been on the verge of scrapping the contract last week Thursday but had reconsidered after Dolphin president Ketan Somaia agreed to re-negotiate certain aspects of the 39-page document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special review team, consisting of the government's most outspoken critics on the deal, including Dr John Hanks from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), chairperson of the Environmental Council (EC) Dr Sue Hart and prominent conservationist, Rupert Lorimer, leave for discussions with Somaia in London on Tuesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining that the contract, which was signed without any public consultation by MPB head, Alan Gray, last year November, was legally binding on the province, select standing committee on finance chairman, Chris MacPherson added that it would have been just too expensive to simply cancel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What it would actually have meant is that MPB would have had to fight the thing in foreign courts, which would have cost US $50-million or R250-million, &quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because the MPB is a government parastatal, that money would come out of public funds - costing the taxpayer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that Dolphin, which is registered in Bermuda but based in Dubai, had already reportedly spent US $3-million setting up the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPB's board of directors also met during an extraordinary five-hour session on Monday to discuss the deal and media speculation about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPB spokesperson, Gary Sutter, confirmed the sitting but was unable to give a statement about its outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board will, however, release a detailed statement later on Tuesdays afternoon, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria Airways, the country's troubled national carrier, has been barred from flying into Britain because it has no insurance on its aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Civil Aviation Authority informed Nigeria Airways in Lagos Tuesday, to keep out of British airspace until it produced proof that its fleet had insurance cover.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Nigeria Airways Public Affairs Manager Chris Aligbe said the airline would still be flying its Lagos-London routes regularly with leased aircraft. The ban affects only the carrier's aircraft not its flying right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, Nigeria's apex insurance company, the National Insurance Corporation of Nigeria, withdrew its cover for Nigeria Airways because of the carrier's unpaid premium of 11 million U.S. dollars for 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, the Israeli Aviation Authority stopped Nigeria Airways aircraft from flying into Tel Aviv, Israel, for the Christian pilgrimage because it had no necessary insurance cover to make the flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in a news conference two weeks ago, the managing director of the airline, Peter Gana, said the national carrier had been meeting its insurance obligation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (PANA) - The Brazzaville-based African Regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO) has promised to send malaria control experts to Mozambique, where the situation of the disease is said to be serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO regional Director, Dr Ebrahim Samba, told reporters in the Congolese capital that his office and the European Union, in conjunction with the Brazilian and Portuguese governments would be working out a scheme to train doctors locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to reports of reduced AIDS-related deaths due to some medical break-through in the developed world, Samba said the regional office was in contact with leading pharmaceutical companies and other partners to make AIDS medicines available to patients in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These medicines are expensive. They are not available to all Europeans or Americans. But they can be bought in Europe and America. At the moment they are very expensive for Africans. We are working out how best to make them available to Africans,&quot; he told journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, at a recent meeting, malaria control experts proposed a three- stage initiative to control the anopheles mosquito transmitted disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first stage will be devoted to the provision of basic support to control programmes while the second and third stages will seek to accelerate and consolidate the control measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experts projected that by the year 2010, at least 50 percent of countries in the 46-nation Africa WHO region will be in the stage of accelerated implementation. The remainder will be in advanced stage of basic support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten years later, all the region's countries are expected to be in the stage of accelerated implementation while in the year 1030, all countries would have completed the stage of programme consolidation with &quot;sustainable control programmes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closing the experts' meeting, Dr Samba said efforts would be made to ensure that African governments contribute financially to the malaria control initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria remains one of the continent's most serious health problems. About 75 percent of the population in the African region live in malaria endemic areas. Nearly 18 percent of this population live under the threat of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts estimate that malaria accounts for between 30 to 50 percent of consultations in most of African hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, African states adopted a programme of action for the control of malaria, but it has been hampered by financial constraints. About 10 million US dollars have been allocated to malaria control programmes in 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Senegal's foreign minister, Mustapha Niass, has denounced what he says is the re-emergence of the Anglophone-Francophone rift in intra-African affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The return to outdated diplomacy based on the language differences of colonial powers is a luxury we Africans cannot afford at this time when all efforts should directed at combating poverty,&quot; he told PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Niass said this Tuesday at the Leopold Sedar Senghor International Airport, where he had gone to see off his Tanzanian counterpart, Jakaya Kikwete.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Niass said Africans needed most to &quot;strengthen our regional integration groups, which will serve as bridges towards the African Economic Community&quot; at a time when the prices of Africa's raw materials were still determined from outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's linguistic rivalry, mostly between French and English speaking countries, has blocked African efforts to head some top international organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest of these occured last week in Tripoli, Libya, where the 65th ministerial council of the Organization of African Unity failed to field a single candidate for post of secretary- general of the International Civil Aviation Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The linguistic cleavage has had a negative impact on other aspects of Pan- African endeavour, including in some sub-regional economic groupings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Niass said Senegal -- a former colony of France in West Africa -- had good relations with Tanzania, once a British colony at the opposite end of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Kikwete delivered a written message from Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, concerning bilateral and continental issues, to Senegalese President Abdou Diouf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On other issues in Africa, Kikwete said the impact of sanctions imposed on Burundi since the July 1996 coup had forced the Bujumbura military junta to concede many concessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However he said, &quot;More efforts will have to be made to bring about reforms in that country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kikwete said reports that neighbouring states had widely violated the sanctions could not be confirmed immediately but that it was &quot;natural for sanctions to get eroded if they last for too long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kikwete left the Senegalese capital for Port Louis, Mauritius, where he is to head Tanzania's delegation at Thursday's inaugural conference of states bordering the Indian Ocean.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - Africa's commitment to fighting drugs remains satisfactory but the continent should speed up the enactment of laws against the menace, a United Nations narcotic control body says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body, The International Narcotics Control Board, says in its 1996 report released Tuesday, that African leaders had acted correctly when they adopted a plan for drug control on the continent, in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board also describes as commendable, the ratification of the Protocol for Drug Control, which was adopted in 1995, by the 12 nations forming the Southern African Development Community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Established in 1968, the board is an agency for the implementation of the U.  N. drug control treaties. These include the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended by the 1972 protocol, and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparation of an annual report is part of the tasks mandated to the 13- member board which has its headquartered in Vienna, Austria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1996 report, released in New York and several other cities worldwide, the board said African countries needed to speed up the process of adopting adequate drug control legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are only a few African countries that have made progress in the updating of their drug control laws,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it says that Burkina Faso, Egypt, Namibia and Nigeria &quot;have formulated such strategies&quot; and that other African states should do likewise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the board has reported an increase in drug trafficking and its abuse in Africa. These drugs are cannabis, cocaine, heroin and methaqualone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Africa, increasing amounts of cocaine are being smuggled out of South America -- mainly Brazil -- through Eastern, Southern and Western Africa into Europe,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board estimates that 60 percent of all cocaine shipped to South Africa passes through this country. The rest is consumed locally. Now abuse of that derivative, crack, is already creating problems in South Africa and many countries in West Africa. Crack is pure cocaine in crystalline form which is smoked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board says that cannabis abuse now abounds in all of Africa's five subregions. Morocco, in the North African subregion, remains the main supplier to Europe. It says that heroin is transported from Asia to African sea and airports for routing to Europe and North America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Methaqualone abuse and trafficking, the board says, are now widespread in Eastern and Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of the board, who launched the report in New York, refused to comment on the controversial annual U.S. certification process, aimed at gauging how effectively other countries combat drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The board does not get between bilateral relations of various countries and it has no opinion on that,&quot; said Herbert Okun, an American member of the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six countries -- Afghanistan, Burma, Colombia, Iran, Nigeria and Syria -- were decertified by the United States last week for not doing enough to fight drug trafficking. The U.S. certified 23 others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decertified countries are cut off from most forms of U.S. assistance and barred from getting loans from multilateral lenders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - A wide section of the Zimbabwean community, including human rights activists, started a crusade Tuesday against what they said were sexual perverts in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Led by politician Michael Mawema, the crusade said it would transform itself into a pressure group that will lobby Zimbabwe's parliament to enact harsh laws for offenses such as homosexuality, rape, incest and bestiality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The culprit must be whipped 100 times in the public square,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He proposed that sexual perverts be castrated. In addition, the group said it would propose a 20-year mandatory sentence for offenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposals come in the wake of increased incidents of homosexuality, rape and incest in Zimbabwe. Most prominent was that alleged of the country's former President, the Reverend Canaan Banana. Details of his homosexual rape of his former aide-de-camp were given in court February 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you not read of some reverends who sleep with other men? Some reverends, with white colors, Mawema said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimbabwe is at a moral and political crossroads,&quot; Mawema. said. &quot;God commands the death of sexual perverts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Forty years ago, the world's attention was focused on the former Gold Coast which was about to make history, as the first black African country to gain independence, on March 6,1957.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the country's first president, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, declared: &quot;at long last the battle has ended and Ghana our beloved is free forever,&quot; the hearts of the enthusiastic crowd who had gathered at the Old Polo Grounds in Accra, jumped with joy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, perhaps, was the proudest moment in the history of Ghana. There was optimism in every sphere of life as goodwill and praise poured in from all over the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a reserve of about 200 million pounds left over from the British colonial administration, the economy was good. Thanks to this, projects such as the Akosombo Dam, Tema Harbour, and the University of Science and Technology were undertaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana became a haven of freedom fighters seeking to lead their countries along that path that Ghana had chartered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Names such as Robert Mugabe, Sam Nujoma, Nnamdi Azikiwe and Hastings Kamuzu Banda, became common in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time that education and health services were free, Ghana's international image was boosted by Nkrumah's Pan-Africanist philosophy which culminated in the founding of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon enough, however, the &quot;honeymoon&quot; came to an end, as economic crunch, among other factors, led to the overthrow of the First Republic in a coup d'etat jointly organized by the military and police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Liberation Council which ushered in the first military administration, was headed by Gen. Joseph Ankrah, who played no part in the coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was soon to be replaced by Brig. Akwasi Amankwah Afrifa who, together Col. Emmanuel Kotoka, and policeman J.W.K. Harley, were the brains behind the coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NLC stayed in power till 1969, when it handed over to the constitutionally-elected government of Dr Kofi Abrefa Busia, who had long been in opposition to Nkrumah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Busia's Progress Party lasted for two-and-a-half years when it was booted out of office by General Ignatius Kutu Acheampong's National Redemption Council (NRC) in January 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Acheampong gave, among his reasons for the coup, the devaluation of the cedi by 44 percent and the reduction of the army's budget by 40 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His &quot;Yentua&quot; (we won't pay) policy on Ghana's foreign debts and his &quot; Operation Feed Yourself&quot; programme, designed to make Ghana self-sufficient in food production found favour with the public and many demonstration were held in support for his regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Gen. Acheampong and his NRC, which metamorphosed as Supreme Military Council (SRC), soon ran foul with the people over the issue of Union Government when the soldiers were pressurized to hand over power to a constitutionally-elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His aim in fusing the military and civilians into one government was to avoid partisan politics which he saw as divisive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a referendum showed that the majority of voters were in support of it, the popular feeling was that the result was rigged and there were mass demonstrations against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is set off a widespread agitations leading to the removal of Gen.  Acheampong as Head of State, in a Palace coup in 1978 led by General Fred Akuffo, his second-in-command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akuffo initiated a series of probes into Acheampong's regime which cashiered him, accused him of sabotaging the economy and confined him to his hometown in the Ashanti Region in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this time there was general discontent with the army and although Akuffo repeatedly pledged that he would hand over to a civilian government by September 1979, he was toppled in June 1979, by an uprising of junior military officers led by Flight Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings formed the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) whose &quot;house- cleaning exercise&quot; resulted in the execution of former heads of state Afrifa, Acheampong, Akuffo and other high-ranking military officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its popularity and revolutionary zeal, the AFRC handed over in September 1979 to Dr Hilla Limann and his People's National Party (PNP) which had won the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Limann's administration was to last for only two-and-a-half years before being kicked out by Flt. Lt. Rawlings who accused them of mismanagement and incompetence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings formed the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) and ruled for 11 years before dumping his military clothes for civilian garb, to enable him to contest elections in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings as Presidential Candidate of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) won the ensuing elections to form the first government of the Fourth Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last December, he and his party went on to win the second elections of the Fourth Republic, to make his government the first ever to serve out a full term in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the world's attention is once again focused on Ghana, many will be wondering what the next 40 years hold in store for this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will it also turn out nine Heads of State and an economy reeling under the pangs of a Structural Adjustment Programme or a nation of &quot;milk and honey&quot; which will be both the political and economic leader of Africa?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairperson of the Truth And Reconciliation Commission, March 5, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is to give strong consideration to investigating allegations that people now in government acted as informants for the Security Police in the apartheid era.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have noted the decision of the TRC's Amnesty Committee this week that it does not consider the naming of alleged informants to be appropriate for the present purposes of the Committee in the hearing that it is currently conducting in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I shall be discussing the matter fully with the Amnesty Committee. However, I do not understand that their decision necessarily precludes other sections of the Commission from conducting an investigation, at least for purposes other than those of the amnesty process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should the Commission decide to investigate the matter, we would first call for statements from those making the allegations. Then, in terms of the recent Appellate Division judgment requiring us to give adequate notice of allegations implicating individuals, we would give the individuals 21 days' notice to prepare a response, and take the matter from there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Hundreds of people are fleeing Kisangani, eastern Zaire, ahead of a feared arrival of rebels, reports AFP. From Kisangani, AFP reports that the quay is full of men, women and children trying to bargain for places in boats leaving Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today pirogues and other vessels were leaving &quot;crammed full of residents desperate to get out&quot;. The rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) is reported to be besieging Kisangani.  Hundreds of thousands of refugees are also believed to be near the town, reports AFP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A column of several thousand people approaching Kisangani was spotted yesterday when a UN mission overflew the area with Dutch Minister of Development Cooperation, Jan Pronk. Pronk said he expected the first of the refugees to reach Kisangani by the weekend. Pronk met representatives of the Zairean government and aid organisations in Kisangani, and said the best option would be to locate the refugees near Ubundu, 200 kilometers southeast of Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In an overflight of the Ubunda area today, the World Food Programme reports the arrival of groups of refugees in Ubundu. According to WFP, the Ubundu airstrip was not good enough for the DC3 to land. WFP plans to evaluate the condition of the airstrip tomorrow with a smaller plane, and hopes to carry out an assessment of the newly arriving refugees. Today, WFP delivered 9 tons of food to Punia, in two planes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* More than 120 Zairean soldiers have surrendered to rebel troops in Kindu since the ADFL took over, reports news agencies. The rebels say they recovered about 100 assault rifles, including M-16 submachine guns, Kalashnikovs, an armoured car and munitions. The ADFL have been repeatedly broadcasting radio messages appealing to government troops to surrender.  Rebels say that among those taken prisoner in the Kindu fight are former Rwandan soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kindu, the ADFL rebels have encountered problems as well as applause by the local population, according to an AFP report. Villagers became angry with the ADFL &quot;justice minister&quot; Kongolo Mwenze, when he said he had asked district leaders and traditional chiefs to appoint new authorities for Maniema Province. A crowd of nearly 1,000 &quot;caused an uproar&quot; and shouted that such people were puppets of President Mobutu Sese Seko. Mwenze had to call a temporary halt to the meeting; he told journalists that it was difficult to avoid using the already established local figures when setting up a new administration. Mwenze also asked villagers for financial contributions to the ADFL cause, and called for civil servants to work without pay. He declared the war must have priority. Kindu is still recovering from extensive looting by retreating government soldiers, and markets and businesses have been brought to a standstill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Regional sources say rebels are advancing into Kasais and Shaba province - Kabila's home area - where they appear to have support from the local population. The latest rebel conquest, Manono, is said to have been taken with a fight this week. Observers speculate that Lumbumbashi - a strong opposition area with a history of political secessionist sentiment - is likely to independently declare itself under rebel control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zairean state-radio said on March 3 that the Zairean Human Rights Association (Azadho) &quot;had confirmed the massive killings bing carried out in the Masisi and Rutshuru areas by the Rwandan troops sent to help Laurent Kabila&quot;. The broadcast said there was talk of &quot;a real genocide of Hutus&quot; by the ADFL rebels and the Rwandan troops. It said alarm was raised in the wake of the stance of the Belgian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Martin Griffiths, Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes region told a news conference in New York that UN plans to repatriate almost 400,000 Rwandan refugees from eastern Zaire were &quot;well-advanced&quot; - but said all depended on the issue of security and of separation of Rwandan militia from genuine refugees. Griffiths added that the UN hoped there would be two land corridors passing through the border town of Bukavu, and said &quot;some kind of international monitoring&quot; would be required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The US State Department said on Wednesday that it was too early to send a multinational force to Zaire. Spokesman Nicholas Burns said Washington had formally asked rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila on Tuesday to open humanitarian corridors for the movement of refugees back to Rwanda &quot;this week&quot; . Burns said there was no committment by the US to a multinational force, as recently suggested by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Vatican Radio reported yesterday that it had unconfirmed reports that nine Rwandan priests and 3 nuns were killed in Kalima on February 25, after the ADFL took control. According to the broadcast, the priests and nuns had come from Bukavu and asked to go to Kasongo, near to Kalima, but had not been able to travel because of lack of transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Zairean government has ordered a popular private television station to shut down for three months for violating a ban on political broadcasts, report Reuters. The owner, Ngongo Luwowo, said his Tel Kin Malebo (TKM) channel would ignore the order, describing it as &quot;illegal&quot;. TKM is one of the most watched private TV stations, and has built an audience on its lively political debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zambia has appealed to donors to assist the government to deal with the influx of Zairean refugees. Zambia's home affairs minister, Chitalu Sampa, told parliament in Lusaka that 29 refugees have died and that conditions for refugees from Zaire are congested, with inadequate shelter, feeding and medical facilities. The refugees are at Mpulungu port, northern Zambia, the main refugee port entry. The minister said that as of last month, the number of refuges was 240 in Kaputa, 327 in Chienge, 1,470 in Natende and 738 at Maheba refugee camp in north western Zambia. Humanitarian sources say that some of the Zairean soldiers arriving refuse to be considered as refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has threatened to embark on sustained mass action this month that could culminate in a national general strike if employer organisations do not accept the federation's proposals on employment conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu Western Cape secretary general Tony Ehrenreich told a news conference in Cape town yesterday that the deadlock with employer organisations could only be broken by decisive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said mass action, scheduled to start on March 10, would comprise human chains and pickets during lunch hours.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But as time goes on and if there is no progress in the negotiations, it will start encroaching on working hours,&quot; Mr Ehrenreich said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Employment Standards Bill sets basic conditions of employment for South African workers. It pulls together the old Basic Conditions of Employment Act and the Wage Act to protect the most vulnerable employees, notably farm and domestic workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federation has called for six-month's maternity leave with four months being paid, a 40-hour working week, which can be phased in over a five-year period, double pay for working on Sundays, and barring children below the age of 16 years from employment to be included in the Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ehrenreich said the national strike would be on May 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last national strike by Cosatu was in April last year, and was aimed at the controversial lockout clause in the new Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu placed worker turnout at 75 percent for that strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to impress on employers that these demands are serious,&quot; Mr Ehrenreich said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are going to change the mindset of business it will be in the tried and tested ways that are familiar to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some economic and political observers have criticised Cosatu in the past for over-robust tactics that harmed the country's economy and made it difficult for its alliance partner, the African National Congress, to implement its macro-economic strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy envisages the creation of one million jobs and a six percent economic growth rate by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ehrenreich, however, dismissed the accusations and said the federation had to protect its members, anyway it could, from possible exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a responsibility to our members and we are not going to shirk away from that responsibility,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill has still to go before the influential National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) and Parliament - a process that could take the whole of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) has criticised Cosatu's mass action plans, saying that it did not know what purpose a strike would serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our view, the Employment Standards Bill is a complicated piece of legislation and Cosatu should let the negotiations take their natural course,&quot; Sacob labour spokesman Janet Dickman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lausanne - There is no doubt Cape Town will be among the four or five shortlisted cities in the race for the 2004 Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the confident prediction of Sam Ramsamy, head of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa and the country's representative on the International Olympic Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having observed the nuances, I believe there is no doubt we will make it in the first four or five,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His optimism is shared today by Sports Minister Steve Tshwete, who said: &quot; My own feeling is that there is no way Cape Town is not going to be on the shortlist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his confidence &quot;derives in part from the interaction we have had with a number of prominent individuals in the Olympic movement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These predictions came as the South African bid team made its final 20- minute presentation to the selection college at the IOC's headquarters at Vidy today. The presentation emphasised, but did not rely on, the sentiment inherent in the African bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there is nothing more to be done but wait for the verdict of the college, due to be announced at 2pm SA time tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town was third in line to make its presentation this morning, after Stockholm and San Juan. Dr Ramsamy opened the presentation with an undertaking that a Cape Town Games would match international standards and take heed of the lessons from previous Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IOC discussions this week reveal that while there is general satisfaction with the outcome, financially and otherwise, of the Atlanta Games, there was considerable unease at the level of commercialism and at the insufficient involvement of the public sector and specifically local government, in Atlanta itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ramsamy also made it clear that all sports federations in South Africa backed the bid, which had his &quot;unqualified endorsement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town mayor Theresa Solomon spoke next, making the point that infrastructural improvements in the city - some of which were highlighted in the evaluation commission report and will be essential for a successful Games - are part of broader strategic initiatives to redress past imbalances and tackle the legacy of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Tshwete said the Games in Africa would make &quot;a real, practical difference to the lives of millions of young people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He introduced a five-minute video message from Deputy-President Thabo Mbeki, who conveyed the Government's full support of the project, and highlighted its significance for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your acceptance of this bid will send a strong signal to the rest of the world that this is the beginning of the African renaissance.&quot; He concluded: &quot; If I consider the history of your distinguished movement, then it seems to me that there has never been a city, a time, a place that is more exciting for the Olympic movement than Cape Town in 2004.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ball focused on the technical expertise of the bid team and hundreds of professional volunteers who have helped to shape the plan, and on sketching the outline of the plan itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team - which, in addition to those closely associated with the bid, included Speaker Frene Ginwala and Olympic medallist Marianne Kriel - had gathered in a room in the Royal Savoy Hotel, effectively the Cape Town bid's headquarters, in Ouchy near the lakeside yesterday, for a brainstorming session on the script.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - He rises from his chair, strides across the spacious office to his desk, picks up his bleeper and studies it intensely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures cross the tiny screen. &quot;See, the RSA bond rate is 15,1 this morning.  The US Treasury long bond is 5,44,&quot; says Finance Minister Trevor Manuel. &quot;I can tell you where the rand is trading, where the dollar is trading and what our bond rates are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By his own admission, these were not matters which concerned him a year ago.  &quot;This is what I feed on every day now.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next week, Mr Manuel will be recorded in history as the first African National Congress minister to table a budget constructed by an ANC-led government. While the details remain a closely-guarded secret until 2.15pm on March 12, the minister this week provided insights into the thinking behind the Budget plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing up a budget for a country was, he said, not all that different from drawing up a household budget. &quot;If consistently from one month to the next, you are spending more than you earn, you are going to run into very serious difficulties,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to exercise choices about what you can afford and what you cannot. Countries face the same constraints.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is spending more than it earns in revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country also owes financial institutions more than R300-billion, a third of this incurred over the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paying the debt has become an important part of the government's budgetary commitment. &quot;This debt places a burden on the country because the government has to repay it at the same interest rate as any member of the public,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why this obsession with paying off the debt when South Africans were in such desperate need of jobs and social services? He explained that the country was competing to capture markets by entering into trade agreements. A 5,1 percent deficit was not considered a healthy sign by international investors. &quot;We try and fight against these people, but they say we represent a risk for as long as we do not prove that we are committed to living within our means,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A country like Botswana has no deficit. Instead, it enjoys a surplus of 11, 2 percent. Compared with South Africa's 5,1 Brazil has a deficit of one percent, Iran 1,4 percent, Turkey seven percent, the US four percent and Sweden 12,2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other dimension to the debt problem was that government departments were not using monies allocated to them. Last year, R9-billion was unspent because departments lacked capacity. The government had to pay interest on the unused R9-billion. &quot;This makes it very difficult to consider further borrowings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He could not accept the argument that borrowing more money would automatically solve the problems facing the country. &quot;We already have to pay R1,35-billion in interest on the R9-billion we have not used,&quot; he said. &quot;The worst thing we can do is to borrow money we cannot spend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throwing money at a problem, he feels, is not always the solution. For example, there was a perception that fighting crime was hampered because the police did not have enough vehicles. The police force of about 130 000 had about 35 000 vehicles, which meant one vehicle for every four police people.  The force worked in three shifts, meaning there were never more than 50 000 persons at work at any one time, making 35 000 vehicles more than adequate.  The problem was how these vehicles were being used and the fact that it had been discovered that a third of the force did not have driver's licences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are not problems of resources, but of management and capacity which Safety and Security is addressing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could double the Safety and Security budget, but do they necessarily have the means to spend the money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The finalisation of the Budget since August last year has been a period of &quot; taking pretty hard decisions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the end of the day, there are always greater demands than resources,&quot; he said. He has had to find ways to satisfy different ministries, to satisfy markets and to satisfy trade union demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you do in making a budget is not an exact science,&quot; he said. &quot;It is the art of combining different policy strands and applying certain economic tests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uppermost in his mind has been crime and job creation. Crime has to be reduced so that the quality of life of all South Africans can be improved and so that conditions can be created to attract investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investment was crucial because this created jobs, he said. The government was committed to creating the economic environment to expand the domestic market and to extend into foreign markets. &quot;We cannot look only to the domestic market,&quot; he said. &quot;The domestic market is small.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To illustrate his point, he described the potential of toothbrush manufacturing. As an example, the production of toothbrushes would lead to more jobs and more people being able to buy toothbrushes in South Africa, but if the government were to strike a trade agreement with China and India for these toothbrushes, many more people would get jobs and many more South Africans would have money to buy toothbrushes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are millions of people in these countries who need all sorts of basic goods. Part of creating the economic environment for job creation was to send out the right signals so that speculative investment could come into the country through the JS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Manuel insists this is a reality of the global economy since the end of the Cold War. &quot;Our choices have been limited. This is becoming a seamless world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Years ago, countries related to one another through trade. This represented 80 percent of all interactions. Today, trade constitutes only 20 percent and the 80 percent of interactions taking place is made up of the decisions taken by fund managers who move billions of dollars around the world every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The turnover of the JSE is in the order of seven billion dollars a day,&quot; he said. &quot;This drives exchange rates, interest policies and shifts the values of entire economies. You ignore it at your peril.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, Mr Manuel has become attached to his little black box. The beeper tells him at what levels world markets are trading. It gives him an idea how fund managers will be reacting. They will be on alert when he makes his speech next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they read the signals as positive, they will move capital onto the JSE. &quot; If there is a big inflow of capital, the interest rate will drop off to 10 or 12 percent,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That will feed through the economy and by the time you speak to your bank manager about a housing loan, the interest rate will be more manageable. The investments also give local companies access to foreign savings which they can then use to create jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why could there not be a discussion with lending institutions in this country to agree to the government paying back its debt at a lower interest rate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is that the lending institutions are insurance companies and pension funds,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This meant that the government owed money to ordinary South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, he was trying to move the country away from a tradition of easy borrowing from these companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are saying to them, don't run to the government, invest in the real economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, investments have gone into salaries of civil servants and government bureaucracy. &quot;We want investments to go into manufacturing and other services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the critics, he is convinced that the inflow of capital onto the JSE will provide the impetus for a further inflow of permanent investment in the form joint ventures between foreign and and local business bringing the jobs which South Africans so desperately need.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A Panorama man and a teenager were today convicted in the Cape High Court of murdering three black Hermanus residents in a drunken killing spree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilfred Jordaan, 26, and the 17-year-old went on a &quot;donder jol&quot; on September 2, 1995, intent on &quot;dondering a few kaffirs&quot;, the court heard during the two-week trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair stood impassively in the dock today as Mr Justice J H Conradie convicted them and ordered them held in custody while awaiting sentence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were found guilty of the murders of Catherine de Wet, whose skull was fractured when she was bludgeoned to death with a steering wheel lock, Eric Mjikiliso, also beaten to death with the lock, and Nkosana Bushula, who was beaten with the lock and stabbed before Jordaan drove over him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were convicted of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm for an attack on Richmond Qwathikazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eachhad attempted in evidence to minimise his role in the attacks and had blamed the other, but they were equally responsible, said Judge Conradie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the attacks had been &quot;so violent ... the accused must have realised (that the injuries they were inflicting) were going to be fatal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge rejected an argument that Jordaan had been &quot;too drunk to have the criminal capacity to form the intent to commit murder&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said both accused had clear memories of the events of the night the three people were killed. The judge ordered them to be held in custody until sentence was passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordaan had been out on R3 000 bail and the youth had been out on warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refusing to allow the pair to remain free, the judge said: &quot;Circumstances have changed dramatically ... and it seems to be accepted that the accused will go to prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argument in aggravation and mitigation of sentence is still to be heard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No skull was, however found, leading police to suspect that more bones may be found in a shallow grave in the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesperson, Sergeant Thabisile Gama, confirmed on Tuesday that the bones have been sent for post mortum tests and said that investigators expected the results by Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The million dollar question at the moment is 'where is the skull'. The shredded clothes found with the bones has convinced us that the bones are human, so there must be a skull somewhere,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't be sure that there are no more bones or clues and so are using a fine tooth comb on the scene to ensure that we miss nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gama said police are still uncertain whether the bones belong to a murder victim or to a person killed by wild animals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NELSPRUIT - The press was accused of waging an &quot;unwarranted and vicious war of words&quot; on Mpumalanga's secret R12,2-billion 'Dolphin Deal' by the board of directors of the Mpumalanga Parks Board (MPB) on Tuesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 50-year deal, which gives the Dubai-based Dolphin Group exclusive commercial development and transverse rights to six State owned game reserves, Loskop Dam, the Blyde River Canyon and Pilgrim's Rest, was signed secretly by MPB head Alan Gray last year without any public consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return for the monopoly on the province's key tourism attractions, Dolphin has undertaken to fund MPB's budget deficit over 50-years and also erect infrastructure in the province totalling at least R300-million over the next three years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray estimates that the budgetary support of his 900 person parastatal will be worth at least R12,2-billion over 50-years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the provincial government reversed its unquestioning support of the deal last week and announced the creation of a review team consisting of the deal's most outspoken critics, MPB's board convened an extra-ordinary on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued after the meeting insists that the media &quot;hullabaloo&quot; over the past few weeks is the result of personal agendas and of &quot;different people interpret(ing) the Dolphin deal's clauses in different ways - often out of context and without any insight or back ground as to why they were included&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the MPB and Dolphin, however, continue to refuse to release copies of the 39-page contract for public debate, citing a fundamental confidentiality clause in it which demands total secrecy of all the contract's terms for at least 50-years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expressing concern that the professionalism of both the MPB and its CEO, Alan Gray were being brought into question by negative publicity, the Board's statement stressed that Gray had at all times abided by the rules and relevant enabling legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement added that Gray had the Board's full support and warned that unless decisive measures were taken to speedily resolve the controversy surrounding the deal, nature conservation in Mpumalanga faced a very uncertain future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charging that both the deal's critics and the media had hidden agendas, the Board said that these agendas could not be allowed to override the provincial interest and had to be brought into the open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporting the new review team's trip to London, where it will meet with Dolphin president, Ketan Somaia, in an attempt to convince him to renegotiate ten &quot;flaws&quot; in the contract, the Board stressed that the contract remained legally binding on the government regardless of whether changes were made or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although Mr Somaia has agreed to revisit clauses in the contract, if (it) is cancelled, it could cost the province in the region of R250-million for breach of contract,&quot; the statement reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement also emphasised that the Board found it noteworthy that less than three percent of Mpumalanga's land surface was currently classified as conservation areas and that only 0,02 per cent of this was targeted for development by Dolphin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement fails to mention that Dolphin holds exclusive commercial control of the entire 0,02 per cent area and therefore has exclusive access and use of the entire area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings appealed Wednesday to the warring parties in eastern Zaire to stop fighting and seek a political solution to their conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the war, being fought between Zairian government forces and rebels known as the Banyamulenge, could engulf other countries in the subregion if not ended quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said this when he met with the secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim. Salim is a guest at Ghana's 40th Independence Anniversary celebrations being observed today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said the Zairian conflict was giving Africa &quot;a disastrous and disgraceful image&quot; and that it was apparent that only negotiations could stop the war from escalating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, he said visit to South Africa last week by rebel leader Laurent Kabila for talks with President Nelson Mandela on ending the war was commendable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings urged Salim to redouble his efforts at finding a solution to the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The role you play in trying times has been outstanding,&quot; he told Salim. &quot; It is only in an atmosphere of stability that we can stabilize our economies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said Ghana's 40th independence anniversary celebration was &quot;a special occasion for the whole of Africa because Ghana's independence heralded a new era for Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said now that the liberation struggle against colonial occupation was over, the focus should now on economic emancipation and ending conflicts within and between African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana, Salim said, had been active in resolving some of these conflicts.  Ghanaian troops first took part in U.N. peacekeeping efforts July 1960 in Congo's, now Zaire, secession crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim told Rawlings, &quot;As we celebrate your anniversary, we should reflect on what is happening in Africa now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim added: &quot;We look forward to a brighter future for Ghana and Africa and Ghana to continue to be a source of inspiration to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned the current conflict in Zaire and in general those of the Great Lakes region saying, &quot;Africa has to face up to these challenges, drawing inspiration from Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Liberia, devastated by seven years of civil that began in 1989, West African leaders sent peace monitoring troops to end the conflict and help the country to holding general elections now scheduled for May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things have changed in the war-torn country,&quot; Salim said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the height of the fighting, leaders of the Economic Community of West African States decided in 1990 to send the troops, know as ECOMOG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim later told reporters that the conflict in Zaire could still be solved although the O.A.U.'s peace efforts had not yet borne fruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the continental body is scheduled to hold a summit on the conflict March 26 in Togo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time is not on our side. There is mass suffering in Zaire,&quot; he said. &quot; Zaire is the heartland of Africa. Whatever happens to Zaire can affect the whole of the continent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, officials of the three countries started negotiations for the revival of East African Community after its collapse in 1977. Legal instruments to revive cooperation among the three states were signed March 1996 in Arusha, Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadaba said each travelling document will be accompanied by a form containing three sets of questions to be answered by the applicant intending to travel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba threatened Thursday to sack his diplomats who take unilateral positions on international matters without first getting directives from Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to be embarrassed because someone has failed to consult and vote in the wrong direction.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will fire anyone who does so,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba was speaking at the swearing in ceremony of Zambia's ambassador to Egypt, Patrick Kafumukache, and his envoy to Germany, Elias Chipimo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambians are taking diplomatic jobs as retirement packages for them and they forget that they are representatives of the president. I will not accept this anymore,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia recently supported a United Nations resolution condemning Nigeria's alleged human rights abuses. Abuja retaliated by suspending technical assistance to Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This bought home at least 70 Nigerians working in Zambia under the technical aid corps scheme, something similar to the United States Peace Corps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba expressed disappointment with the foreign ministry for failing to send regular information to missions abroad on current issues in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said lack of information had attributed to the bad picture painted abroad on Zambia concerning democracy and on the fairness of the 1996 general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His government, he said, had achieved landmark successes in economic and democratic reforms but most countries were unaware of them because they lack information from the country's representatives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Nigerian Federal High Court in Lagos has ruled that Godwin Ajayi will continue as the leading defence lawyer for the detained, Moshood Abiola, who faces treason charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court's ruling came on Wednesday, ending the one-year legal dispute between two senior Nigerian lawyers over who defends Abiola, who is charged with treason for declaring himself president in 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ajayi's position was challenged last year by Kola, one of Abiola's children, who claimed he had his father's mandate to change the defence counsel for alleged lack of progress in the trial, which began in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute had pitted Kola against his step mother, Kudirat, one of Abiola's wives who was killed by unknown gunmen last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kola had wanted to replace Ajayi with Rotimi williams, while the outspoken Kudirat, before she was killed by unidentified gunmen in Lagos on June 4, 1996, had insisted that Ajayi should continue with the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruling on an application brought by Williams, Justice Babatunde Belgore of the Federal High Court said the issue of representation should have been settled by a litigant before going to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He therefore rejected Williams' application that Abiola be brought to court to choose his defence counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no indication if Williams intended to appeal against the ruling.  Legal experts say that such an appeal could only delay the millionaire's trial even further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abiola, who claimed victory in Nigeria's 1993 presidential election, cancelled by Gen. Ibrahim Babangida before he retired, is awaiting trial for treasonable felony for declaring himself president of the country in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite local and international pleas for his release, the government of Gen. Sani Abacha has insisted the trial should go ahead because Abiola violated the law of the land.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KIGOMA, Tanzania (PANA) - Tanzania has launched an international appeal for assistance to enable it cope with the increasing number of Zairian refugees flocking into its western region of Kigoma, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the appeal here, the Principal Secretary in the Prime Minister's Office, Ben Moses, told a delegation of ambassadors and representatives of the United Nations system who are touring Kigoma that the government has given sanctuary to refugees but needed assistance to resettle them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moses said the refugees influx was so abrupt that the government was lacked the means to finance the upkeep of more than 253,000 Zairian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Representative in Kigoma, John Adu, said that if the influx continued at the present rate of 1, 000 per day, then every month, a new refugee camp will have to be opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1,000 and 1,500 refugees were being received at the Kibilizi Port in Kigoma everyday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adu said his agency was now sending Zairian refugees to Lugufu camp which, as of Tuesday, had 25,000 refugees. They come mostly from Fizi area in eastern Zaire where the Zairian army is fighting rebel forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Representative Victor Angelo, leading the strong-powered delegation of high ranking officials from Dar es Salaam-based embassies on Wednesday visited refugee camps at Kigoma's Lake Tanganyika Stadium, National Milling Corporation and the Ministry of Home Affairs holding ground.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - President Jerry John Rawlings on Thursday appealed to Ghanaians to gird their loins, forget the past and build on the achievements they have made over the past 40 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we have deserted our goals and ideals as a people, this is the time to return to them,&quot; he said, when addressing a colorful parade of school children and some voluntary organizations to climax Ghana's 40th independence anniversary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana, which got its independence from Britain on 6 March 1957, became the first black Sub-Sahara African country to win its flag independence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parade was witnessed by several foreign dignitaries including President Henri Konan Bedie of Cote d'Ivoire and former President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Fathia Nkrumah, the Egyptian-born widow the Ghana's first president, Kwame Mkrumah, and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim, were also in attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said the nation must see beyond its present circumstances &quot;and move forward to the targets we have set and use our faith as a driving power to get to where we want to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said every nation has its share of struggles of one kind or another and Ghana is no exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We each have a part to play and that part does not include fault finding and blind criticism because civic responsibility means doing something and not complaining that something ought to be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said the time had come to redefine patriotism &quot;because except we combine all of our efforts we will not get far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not the duty of one person but every man, every woman and every child. Those who refuse to contribute and will not allow anyone else to give of themselves must step aside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Ghanaians must not despair even if things go wrong as things would sometimes do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we must march forward we must remember that it takes courage and perseverance. It takes a desire to succeed.&quot; &quot;It takes vigilance and hard work, faith in God as well as in ourselves as a nation and in our dreams and visions. Let us not take for granted what has cost men and women their lives,&quot; Rawlings said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said as the nation celebrates it 40th anniversary &quot;let us strive to finish the work which began four decades ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To bind up the national wounds and do all to achieve and cherish lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is my desire that we will each become a light of hope and of truth, peace and love. Each of us a flame burning corruption and dishonesty, greed and viciousness once and for all,&quot; the President said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings commented for the first time on the alleged financial scandal involving A-Life Supermarket and some officials of the Ghana Commercial Bank and said it was criminal for the bank to give one person loans amounting to billions of cedis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said small scale industrialists find it difficult to get loans from banks but it is an irony that a trader could get such huge amounts from a bank to set up stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is economic murder,&quot; the President said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to condemn in the strongest terms the arrest and imprisonment of Masautso Phiri, special projects editor for the privately owned newspaper The Post, on February 11, 1997. Phiri was sentenced to three months in jail by the Supreme Court of Zambia on charges of contempt of court, following an article entitled &quot; Praising God Loudly&quot; which was published in the December 11, 1996 issue of The Post. The article alleged that the seven judges of the Supreme Court had been paid a total of K7 billion (US$5 million) to rule in favor of the state in a case where opposition parties challenged the candidacy of President Frederick Chiluba in the November 18, 1996 elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Many in the church and outside say that without women's participation, churches would grind to a halt, as reported by APS Correspondent Sam Gonza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that women are pillars of the living church is underscored by the findings of study teams that the World Council of Churches (WCC) sent to each of its over 300-member churches in more than 100 countries worldwide, as part of the Ecumenical Decade of the Churches in Solidarity with Women (1988-1998).  But there is also the general lament that women are still frustrated by the churches' failure to admit them into critical areas of decision making and participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its first Assembly held in Amsterdam, Netherlands in 1948, the World Council of Churches (WCC) heard a ground breaking report on the role and status of women in the church. Fifty years later, come 1998, the Eighth General Assembly, to be held in Harare, Zimbabwe, and which will also coincide with the ecumenical council's 50th anniversary and the end of the WCC Ecumenical Decade of the Churches in Solidarity with Women (1988-1998), will listen to emphasis on the pivotal role that women play as pillars of the living church. But at Harare, there will be a special plea to the churches to commit themselves to enlarging women's participation in key areas of Church life.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Study teams sent out as part of the WCC Ecumenical Decade in Solidarity with Women reported that around the world, Christian women witness to the image of God within them. &quot;The hope of renewal for church and society rests in this witness. Wherever we went as living letters to the churches, the women's love for the church and their willingness to commit themselves to work in church were strikingly evident. All over the world women are the pillars of the church,&quot; the teams concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women are always active, strong and ready to carry forth the church's mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teams were inspired by evidence of women's determination to overcome oppression. They met women in the churches who were working in their local and national context to roll away the stones of violence, racism, economic injustice and exclusion. &quot;There are women with enormous zest for life, who struggle for life, who are committed to social political change, who are resisting the forces of death,&quot; the team noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among examples of women's determination and resistance were; women running crisis centres for victims of rape and battering; women involved in credit cooperatives and revolving loan funds; women organising community soup kitchens and feeding centres; literacy andvocational training programmes and women working with refugees, migrants and internally displaced people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also an increasing number of women who are breaking their silence and speaking out, campaigning against violence or harmful cultural practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, just as evident were many churches' failure to fully receive and respond to women's gifts and challenges, to admit women to key areas of participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their report, the study teams accentuate the fact that women are the majority in most congregations and the keenest participants in the spiritual and liturgical life of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Togolese church president told the team that he had discovered that women kept his church alive, that without the women there would be no life and hardly any regular activities in the church. &quot;If the women were to leave, we would have only decision-makers without doers,&quot; he told the WCC team visiting member churches in the African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teams concluded that women are active in a wide variety of lay ministries-diakonia, fund raising, teaching and counselling in parish life. &quot; They gain strength and satisfaction from all these kinds of participation even if their contribution is not always recognised and they are unable to attain leadership in these areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Significantly on their travels, the study teams also met women - both feminist theologians and lay women - who are ready to assume new roles in the church. &quot;These women are determined to draw out the liberating strands of their faith. They nurture a vision of the church that is a community of women and men, that listens to hopes, dreams, frustrations, that is a source of liberalization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their report, the WCC teams point out that some women have found no place in the church to nurture their deep spiritual yearning and, after much frustration have started alternative church movements as new ways of being the church, of expressing their spirituality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could be said that, rather than these women leaving the church, it is the hierarchical church which abandoned them. As one woman put it; Sometimes you have to leave the church in order to go back to the church,&quot; noted the WCC study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example in Switzerland, a woman remarked that women often feel the only way they can get &quot;out of the playroom&quot; is to act quite independently of the established church. &quot;Yet the renewal of the church must depend on the valuing and honouring-often financially as well-the talents of all its members equally, and not just paying lip service to the community of women and men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Madagascar, a small group of young women theologians, students and wives of students shared with the visiting WCC team their struggle to be admitted and accepted and their pain of not being allowed to the ministry to which they felt called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We learned that what had been represented to us as an achievement of the church-the admission of female students to the faculty-was in fact a victory they had won after a long fight,&quot; the visiting team noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kenyan churches, the number of top women in positions of hierarchical responsibility is &quot;infinitesimal,&quot; the team there observed. &quot;It became clear that most churches have neither a policy nor developed a theological position to empower women to become clergy, theologians or lay readers in significant positions of majority decision-making in the church in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The excuse given in some churches which accept the ordination of women, but do not have enough pastors, is that women in the church do not really wish to take advantage of the opportunities to become pastors. Other churches do not actively promote or encourage women to put themselves forward for the ordained or theological ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ghana, they found among the reasons cited for the failure of women to participate in leadership, was that &quot;women are their own worst enemies, because when given the opportunity to elect women, they elect men!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teams' report says as a rule, women may find it extremely difficult to voice discontent in the presence of men in general and church leaders in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time and again during our visits, women said little or expressed general satisfaction in the presence of men or male church leaders, but eventually, when the men were not there, told us quite a different story. And occasionally it happened that our visit encouraged women to speak out for the first time about being denied a place in church structure, even in the presence of the head of the church,&quot; noted the WCC study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa for example, most meetings included male leadership. The latter always assumed the role of moderators and spokespersons even when the questions were directed to the women present. &quot;The women themselves, in almost all cases, would not respond immediately and waited, as if they also expected the minister, bishop, or whoever to be the one to respond. &quot;We detected some degree of uneasiness on the part of the male leaders when we posed questions to the women and some hesitancy on the part of the women,&quot; the WCC team said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zambia, men were often the first to tell how things were for women. &quot;But when the women in the same meetings finally spoke, their assessment of their own situation was radically different from that given by the men.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa - In poor health, Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko is facing one of his worst crises ever since advancing rebels in this central African nation took up arms in the eastern regions of North and South Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sprawling Zaire must be weighing heavily on President Mobutu Sese Seko, who was recently in France convalescing following a prostate cancer operation and on an official tour of Morocco, appealing for help to regain control of the eastern region, currently held by rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Morocco tour came shortly after a Zairean army counter-offensive to regain the North and South Bukavu regions collapsed and the Zairean Tutsi rebels, known as the Banyamulenge, started gaining ground and securing footholds in two other neighbouring regions in a lightning onslaught also aimed at overthrowing the long-ruling Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu, who arrived in the North-West African country on February 4 was seeking aid from his traditional ally, King Hassan II, just as Zaire's official news agency, AZAP was announcing a massive recruitment drive, asking boys aged 15 to 18 to sign up at the nearest police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his Moroccan visit, Mobutu met with King Hassan, who in 1977 provided troops to help down a rebellion at Kolwezi, a major mining centre in Shaba province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a rebel spokesman scoffed at the bid, saying: &quot;We are no longer in the era where Morocco can easily aid Mobutu. Times have changed. Morocco should understand that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togo, another traditional ally of Zaire, has said there was no question of it sending troops to Zaire, while in Cairo a senior Egyptian official said on February 4 that Zaire had asked for &quot;political support,&quot; but denied there had been a request for military aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, another former ally, has ruled out supplying military aid to Kinshasa, citing an European Union arms embargo against Zaire, but there were indications that Chad was willing to send in a force to help Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the Zairean Armed Forces (FAZ) recruitment drive on February 4, AZAP said new forces were needed to deal with &quot;the aggression...by regular Rwandan and Ugandan troops allied with Kabila's rebels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far the FAZ, stymied by severe logistical and financial problems, has remained largely on the defensive in the face of rebel advances, managing only to rescue an area near Walikale in North Kivu province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAZ soldiers, who currently earn an average of one dollar a month and have not been paid in months, have already staged two rebellions in the capital Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Zairean government has flown fresh men and munitions to the Watsa area, the rebels have already taken the wind out of the FAZ counter- offensive, which the government vowed two weeks ago would be &quot;sweeping and crushing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By capturing the key port of Kelemie on the banks of Lake Tanganyika on February 3, the rebels have not only extended the territory under their control in the east of the country, but can now boast a bridgehead in Zaire's resource-rich Shaba province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Led by Laurent-Desire Kabila, they are now present in four provinces -- North and South Kivu, which they have controlled since November, Haut-Zaire and Shaba. Their holdings stretch some 1,000 kilometres along Zaire's eastern border with Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building on their strength, the rebels issued an ultimatum on February 4, giving the government until February 21 to open negotiations or face a &quot; general offensive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lubmana Kapasa, head of the Zairean presidential press service, said in Rabat, where President Mobutu Sese Seko was seeking assistance; &quot;There is no question of having a dialogue with the rebels for the simple reason that these people are puppets manipulated by Rwanda and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't hold dialogue with a traitor. War remains the only solution to ending the rebellion and the position of the Zairean government has not changed one iota on this subject,&quot; he said, referring to Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Zairean authorities, welcoming a proposal by visiting European Union special envoy for a regional meeting prior to any international conference on the Great lakes region cautioned that it wants &quot;invading forces&quot; off its soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a broadcast on national television, EU envoy Mr. Aldo Ajello, following a meeting with Zaire's Foreign Minister, said his responsibility was to seek a peaceful way out of the crises in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently seeking to shrug off the loss of Kalemie as well as setbacks in the north-east, FAZ spokesmen in Kisangani, the capital of Haut-Zaire and headquarters of the government counter-offensive, have reiterated that the rebels were backed by professionals, and not the ragtag rebels who first took up arms in September, a reference to Kinshasa's repeated accusations against Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi of involvement in the fighting, charges all the three countries have strongly denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FAZ spokesman, who requested anonymity, also charged for the first time on February 5 in Kisangani that the rebels had managed to obtain military equipment, which included communications equipment and mortars, that was sent to a neighbouring country late last year for a multi-national intervention force that never materialized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other sources in Kisangani have also claimed that the FAZ was being backed by former Rwandan Hutu soldiers, who are held responsible for the 1994 genocide in their country, which left between 500,000 and one million dead, most of them minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel advance has now triggered a new movement of refugees in the region, which has previously housed hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighbouring Rwanda, most of whom have since returned home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 40,000 refugees and some 7,000 Zairean civilians are reported by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to have left camps in Shabunda on February 5 and fled after learning that the rebels had captured Katshungu, a town some 45 kilometers away. Shabunda has since also fallen to the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the refugee sites in Shabunda are empty,&quot; an UNHCR statement released in Geneva said, quoting a top UNHCR official in the region, Dillah Dumaye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FAZ, underpaid and under-equipped, appear in increasing disarray in the face of a well-disciplined and well-supplied rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the raging fighting in the eastern Zairean regions, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata embarked on a tour of the restive Great Lakes region central Africa on February 6 to see first-hand the plight of refugees who are at once victims of war and international indifference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to try to give them some kind of humanitarian assistance to save their lives and come to a solution,&quot; she said prior to her trip to Zaire, Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania that will continue up to February 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Progress was made when 1.2 million Rwandan Hutus recently trekked home in biblical fashion after more than two years in exile, putting aside fears of Tutsi reprisals for the genocide of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 600,000 Rwandans and Zaireans continue to struggle in a living hell in eastern Zaire, transformed into a vast battlefield as rebels confront government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogata said that first, she wanted to ensure that a minimum of humanitarian aid reaches refugees who are living in makeshift camps where high mortality ates are the norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, she will press for control over armed extremists who continue to lord it over refugee camps, scaring people from returning to their homes, and finally, she hoped to organize the return of as many more Rwandan refugees as possible by convincing the various sides involved to create free-travel zones in eastern Zaire, but she faces enormous obstacles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A logistical nightmare makes it difficult to get relief aid to three camps housing 200,000 refugees, while humanitarian groups have also been unable to reach tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of Rwandans and Zaireans who have been wandering around eastern Zaire for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics on the ground have also further complicated matters. The Zairean authorities want relief flights to be inspected in Kinshasa before going on to the refugee camps, as flights coming from Uganda are accused of sending troops to fight alongside Zairean rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kigali states for its part that the Rwandan refugee camps outside its borders are teeming with former Hutu soldiers and their families, who are hostile to its Tutsi-led government, but disarming the militias is a task that lies outside the scope of the UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has to be some kind of separation effort made, not just by civilians like us, but by police or some kind of military force,&quot; said Ogata, who favours creating an international &quot;stand-by&quot; force that could snap into action on orders from the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, creating security zones for refugees in eastern Zaire to return home by foot or truck will require long negotiations with all parties in the area, she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogata does not hide her relative impotence in the face of a reluctance by third countries to get involved in the Zairean conflict and to help ease refugee suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the crisis, she said: &quot;It is not going to be solved so soon, overnight.  But at least international attention and determination have to be mobilized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tanzania, where 220,000 refugees from Burundi are lingering on, Ogata is looking for guarantees that the government will not expel them back to their country, where a civil war continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 122 refugees were killed upon their return to Burundi last month after having been forced out of Tanzania.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The uvula has always been cut, say traditional practitioners and adherents. But medical experts argue that if 'that harmless cut in the mouth' must be performed, then all necessary sanitary precautions should be taken, as reported by APS Correspondent George Mwangi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Ngotho, 20, could not even brave it to hold her baby as the traditional uvula cutter (daktari wa kilimi in Kiswahili) prepared to perform what this young mother believed was a crucial operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her grandmother, visiting Mary's family last Christmas, had diagnosed the child's uvula as sick and insisted that it should be removed. She had accompanied her granddaughter to the makeshift clinic in the city outskirts to supervise the cutting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when Mary appeared hesitant at the eleventh hour, her grandmother harshly reminded her why they were at the clinic; &quot;What is better? To let the doctor cut the uvula or to let it kill the baby?&quot; Upon which she took the child from its mother and held it firmly, ready for the &quot;doctor&quot;. Perhaps terrified, the one-year-old let out a scream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no anaesthesia. The traditional uvula cutter held the baby's jaws with his left hand to force the mouth wide open. Then he put a table spoon in the mouth, apparently to hold the tongue back and when the uvula end is clipped to fall in it. With a pair of long surgical tongs, he held the uvula still, while with a pair of surgical scissors he clipped its tip. Then he removed the spoon with the small piece of flesh in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was very quick - about one minute. The operation was over. Perhaps due to the immense pain, the baby did not cry much. There was no after-cut treatment. They paid Kshs 50 (about one US dollar) and left the &quot;clinic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditional uvulectomy is still practised in most parts of Africa especially among the Bantu tribes. In Kenya, it is commonly carried out among the Kikuyu, Akamba, Kalenjin and Maasai among others. A spot-check in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, will more often than not reveal that most people got their uvula cut at childhood, regardless of their present age or ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not known when and where the practice started. As common with African knowledge and philosophy, it is documented in the mind and handed down through generations. However, traditionally before the introduction of surgical instruments now in use, the Kikuyu used a rugaa, a local cutting tool made from cow hide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what is uvula and why is it cut? The uvula can be defined as a small cone shaped piece of flesh that hangs from the back of the roof of the mouth, bordering the nasopharynx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the medical world, the uvula has no known function in human anatomy.  Bacterial or viral infection may cause inflamation. In the former, antibiotic treatment is usually recommended while in the latter case, the swelling subsides in a few days. Uvulectomy - the cutting of the uvula - can only be medically preferred in cases where there is a tumour or a cancerous growth on the uvula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kenya, government, mission and most private hospitals and clinics do not recommend uvulectomy. Dr. A. Patel, a practising surgeon in Nairobi says uvulectomy is not traditionally or medically practised in the Indian sub- continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American paediatrician Dr. Jackob Havenen, currently working in Kikuyu Mission Hospital says uvulectomy is not carried out in America and Europe. &quot; Even in a case where the throat may be too narrow, obstructing breathing and swallowing, doctors remove the tonsils but not the uvula.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally, mothers who seek uvulectomy for their babies complain that the uvula is too long, causing the baby to have coughs and vomit. They also believe that if the uvula is not cut, it will interfere with the child's voice development, eventually leading to stammering in adulthood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, medical experts disagree with this belief. Dr. D. Simiyu, a paediatrician and lecturer at Nairobi University says; &quot;In the natural history of child development, a child will normally have coughs seven to eight times. Since traditional uvulectomy is done at a time when the child's immune system is not fully developed, this coincidence makes mothers believe it is the uvula which causes the cough, although in actual sense the uvula has nothing to do with the cough. Whether it is cut or not, it does not make any difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Peter Mugwe, an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) specialist notes that mothers seek uvulectomy due to lack of knowledge. He explains: &quot;Children will have colds and coughs usually at night, which may have something to do with the nasal passage blockage and their weak immune system. Vomiting is a digestion problem, while voice development is determined by the vocal cords.  Therefore, proper treatment for these diseases should be sought instead of treatment on other secondary factors, in this case, removing the uvula. This is also against medical practice and ethics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case of an inflamation of the uvula or uvulitis, Dr. Mugwe says the uvula appears long, swollen, reddish or has pimples at the tip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A qualified physician would advise on treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Anos O. Opiyo, who runs a private child health clinic in a Nairobi estate, notes that mothers will bring their babies to see him before or after uvulectomy. &quot;Before - a mother will ask if the uvula should be cut as she is not sure whether it is the one causing the cough. After - now a mother will be sure it is not the uvula causing the cough, as the child is still coughing, and she is now seeking proper medical treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residential traditional uvula cutters can be found in mostly low- income suburbs but they maintain a low profile as they operate without licences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Peter Mukono, a traditional uvula cutter, running a &quot;clinic&quot; some 25 kilometers from the city centre, had this to say about his trade; &quot;It is in my family. I inherited it from my late father who got it from my grandfather.  Firstly, when a mother brings a child I look in the mouth to see whether the uvula is long, reddish and with pimples before I accept to cut it. Not everybody can cut it, there is a way of doing it. It has to be precise and at a particular point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no &quot;after-cut&quot; treatment although some traditional practitioners advice their patients to take aspirins or a ginger soda to relief the pain.  Charges range from between Ksh 50 and Kshs 150 (1 US$ = Ksh 55) in Nairobi and parts of Central Province. On average, Mr Mukono attends to ten patients per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all mothers support uvulectomy. Mrs Muthoni Kimaru, 35, says she will never take any of her children for an uvulectomy. She narrates an incidence she witnessed in a local district hospital early last year-&quot;In the children's clinic, there was a mother in the queue with a baby who looked seriously ill. Its face was turning pale. But the frightened mother kept her place in the line for some time. But then some women noticed her baby looked seriously ill and urged her to jump queue and see the doctor. We later learnt that she had taken the child for an uvula cut in a quack's clinic in the town's slum area. The child's uvula had been cut wrongly, resulting in excessive bleeding. It was too late to save the baby's life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A social worker Mrs Ruth Okare says it is inhuman to subject a child to such unnecessary pain. &quot;Nowadays there are proper means of treatment, why resort to an unnecessary primitive way?&quot; she poses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But traditional uvulectomy is not confined to children alone. Even adults who were not cut in childhood may opt for it if the uvula becomes persistently inflamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esther Muthoni, 23, a bank employee, recently had her uvula cut. &quot;It is now better than having it make me occasionally sick,&quot; she said. Muthoni got her uvula cut at Ndumberi village, about 20 kilometers from the city centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionalists argue that uvulectomy used to play a significant role in the old days when there were no hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was our God given wisdom to treat uvula sickness,&quot; said Mumbi Kangu, 60.  But she notes that since medical treatment is available today then there is no need for uvulectomy. But as an after thought, she asks, &quot;If you say it has no function in the body, why don't they cut it instead of the treatment which will be recurrent and costly especially nowadays when we pay even in government hospitals?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although traditional uvula cutters operating in Nairobi generally take basic precautions by boiling their tools in water, still there is a danger of spreading disease through blood contamination as the tools may not be consistently sterilized after every use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, in rural areas, sanitary measures may not be taken seriously due to a lower level of awareness and general illiteracy.  Traditional uvula cutting thus puts the health of many children and adults at the risk of contracting diseases such as the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome - HIV/AIDS, tetanus and syphilis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other complications that are likely to occur as a result of the infected wound include septicaemia (blood poisoning), which would definitely cause further complications. Excessive bleeding, especially if the child is haemophilic or the uvula is cut wrongly can result in anaemia - or worse - death. Ironically, much as the cut is done to stop coughing, the wound itself may end up causing an irritating cough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Dr. Simiyu puts it, &quot;if uvulectomy is done through the right process, it is a harmless tradition and thus difficult to die.&quot; But it is up to the Ministry of Health to establish acceptable working grounds with the traditional uvula cutters so that the necessary sanitary measures are observed in their practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the public should be enlightened on the dangers of uvula cutting by quacks. &quot;As it does not make any difference medically whether it is cut or not - those doing it must be warned to do it hygienically,&quot; observes Dr. Simiyu.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A cross section of Kenyans including clergy say the deadline set for the issuance of second generation Identity Cards (IDs) should be extended and obstacles in the process eliminated so that all deserving citizens can be accommodated in the nation-wide exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 30, President Daniel arap Moi extended the previous January 31 deadline by a month, up to the end of February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Kenyans argue that the February 28 deadline would not be adequate, given the many obstacles that hamper the process of registering for new generation IDs. These range from relaxed officers, corruption and lack of enough manpower to handle the situation effectively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I only need to walk out of my office to see the long queues of Kenyans - young and old, desperately chasing this new ID,&quot; says Rev. Canon Peter Njoka, the Provost of Nairobi's All Saints (Anglican) Cathedral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His church compound is housing one of the nation-wide centres that have been set up for the exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Njoka doubts that the extra time of one month would enable deserving Kenyans register for the IDs. &quot;Definitely one month will not be enough. We need more time for this exercise and it is my hope that President Moi will reconsider the idea of extending the current deadline for the exercise if requested to do so by Kenyans,&quot; the Provost observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan President announced the extension of the previous January 31 deadline upon request by University of Nairobi students who had hosted him for dinner at their campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Anglican clergy wondered why registration of the national identity card, normally a continuous process, should be linked with deadlines or general elections scheduled late 1997. &quot;The exercise should be an on-going process.  We should not neglect the fact there is always a Kenyan or Kenyans attaining 18 years, (the age of majority) every day,&quot; he told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he had concrete reasons to believe that the ID registration exercise is being linked to the country's forthcoming general elections, Rev.  Njoka, retorted; &quot;Well at least this is the general thinking among Kenyans and it is up to the government to prove them wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me, the process of registering persons for national identification is normal and genuine. It should be delinked from any other business for a free and effective process,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference, called on January 28, two days before President Moi extended the IDs' deadline from January 31 to February 28, Kenya's Episcopal Conference had addressed the issue of &quot;delinking&quot; the issuance of the new IDs to the forthcoming general elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kitgum, Uganda - Kitgum Anglican Bishop Marclord Baker Ochola II has made a scathing attack on Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni for refusing to talk peace with Ugandan rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) led by Joseph Kony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a requiem mass for a senior government official killed by the rebels early this month, the bishop reminded Ugandans that in the end everyone will face death. He went on to say every government in the world - &quot; even if it stays in power for 500 years will go......&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kitgum District of Northern Uganda is home to Uganda's Acholi people. Early 1997, the Lord's Resistance Army, comprising many ex- Ugandan Army soldiers who served previous regimes, descended on several villages in the district, killing as many as 300 innocent civilians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Uganda says these raids are facilitated by the Sudanese government, which it charges supports various rebel groups in Northern Uganda.  Sudan has denied such accusations, counter charging that Uganda facilitates rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Ochola, in what observers see as an unusually one-sided attack on the government in Kampala, said if President Museveni wants to finish the Acholi people, he should not use Kony rebels, but should turn his guns onto the people and finish them directly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kitgum bishop said talking peace with the rebels does not mean the government is weak or defeated but the purpose would be to stop the killing and displacement of innocent people. More than 200,000 people are believed to be displaced due to the current fighting in Northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout much of 1996, Uganda's Catholic bishops also urged President Museveni to talk peace with the rebels. Museveni has consistently rejected those pleas saying the rebels had committed unforgivable atrocities against the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the government has instituted a policy of pardoning rebels who surrender. The President says such amnesty does not apply to the leaders of the rebel groups in the north, because they are the mastermind of the atrocities against innocent civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Bishop Ochola's denunciation of the government, Uganda's Vice- President Dr. Specioza Kazibwe rapped religious leaders advocating talks with the rebels, saying doing so created a false belief among rebel ranks that they are supported by religious leaders. &quot;Even the Bible commands; 'Do not kill' yet these bishops say if he is killing talk to him,&quot; she observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a Verona priest was recently dragged from the altar by rebels of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) and taken to the mission house where rebels took away property worth thousands of dollars. The WNBF are allied to the LRA but operate in north-western Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italian Fr. Silvano Renzo of Ladonga Parish, was conducting early mass when some 20 rebels descended on the church and forcibly removed him from the altar. There were no reports of injury among the congregation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accra - During a recent visit to Ghana, African-American biochemist Dr.  Jack Felder, 57, charged that the HIV/AIDS virus was deliberately engineered by American germ warfare scientist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also went on to say that polio vaccines and other drugs being sent to Africa could contain the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His claims about AIDS-polio vaccine linkage caused a lot of fear since his statement coincided with a nation-wide anti-polio immunization campaign funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the claims by Dr. Felder, the American Embassy here described the accusation as &quot;scurrilous&quot;. The embassy described Dr. Felder, a one time employee of the Army's Natick Laboratories - biological research laboratories - as &quot;an eccentric.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's leading medical scientist Dr. Francis Nkrumah asserted angrily that there was &quot;no iota of truth&quot; in Dr. Felder's claim linking polio vaccination to HIV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a new book published in the United States late last year is set to fuel the apprehension of millions of people worldwide. Entitled, Emerging Viruses - the Story of AIDS and Ebola, it was researched by an American dentist Dr.  Leonard Horowitz, who worked on it since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new title reproduces United States Defence Department papers of 1970, relating to Dr. Henry Kissinger's directive to American scientists to produce AIDS type viruses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book traces the mass outbreak of AIDS in the early 80s to the 1974 vaccination with a Hepatitis B Vaccine that it claims was first tested on the gay (homosexual) community and mentally retarded children in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The author claims that later the same year, this same vaccine was tested in Eastern Zaire, Central Africa and North-Western Uganda. Dr. Horowitz says this contamination was by accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Horowitz who claims he stumbled on the evidence in 1990 told the Voice of America - Voices of Africa programme that the AIDS viruses came originally from monkeys that had been modified by a team of American researchers led by Dr. Robert Gallo - the man reputed to have discovered the HIV or AIDS causing virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claims the researchers had modified the viruses to see if primate (i.e.  originating from monkeys or chimpanzees) viruses could cause cancers in humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The primate virus - the HIV precursor - was first implanted in white cells which allowed it to bridge the gap between human and primates. That is how the jump occurred,&quot; the researcher explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Horowitz says that Dr. Gallo virtually told a lie about &quot;discovering&quot; the HIV virus. A substantial amount of research with these modified viruses were done in north-western Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Horowitz, other key players in the development of the killer virus included a founder of an American drug company and biological warfare expert who came to the United States from Germany after the Second World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing 1970 Department of Defence appropriation papers, the book blames Dr Henry Kissinger,United States Secretary of State at the time as the author of the campaign to develop anti-immune system viruses for warfare purposes. The Department of Defence papers show $10 million was made available to researchers for the purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others who have blamed Dr. Kissinger include Capt. Joyce Riley of the Texas- based Gulf War Veterans Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the World Wide Christian Radio that she had stumbled across papers implicating Dr. Kissinger by accident while researching the series of strange diseases that have reportedly killed 15,000 Americans since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an official of the Washington-based National Cancer Institute who contributed to the Voice of Africa programme said the retro- viruses (the class of HIV precursors found in primates such as monkeys) had modified themselves naturally and entered the human body through food and other pathways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Raoul Benveniste insisted on the programme that the technology for the modification of viruses was not available at the time. &quot;The retroviruses are only present in African primates. This is why the disease originated in Africa,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - As South Africa's new Constitution, regarded as one of most liberal in the world, came into effect on February 3, one of its significant features was already being embraced by citizens eager to exercise their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new basic law replaced the interim constitution under which the country has been governed since the historic all-race elections in April 1994, and opened the way for the next elections that must take place before April 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the constitution's most significant features is a new Bill of Rights which outlaws racism, prohibits capital punishment and permits abortion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 20 women sat quietly in a busy ward of the sprawling Baragwanath hospital in Johannesburg the same day the constitution took effect, to seek to become among the first in South Africa to have newly-accessible, legalized abortions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, only eight were given oral abortion pills or were booked for surgery later in the week and the rest told to return another day to Baragwanath, listed in the Guineas Book of World Records as the world's largest hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At other hospitals in Gauteng, which encompasses Johannesburg and Pretoria, health officials experienced a similar &quot;considerable demand&quot; for abortions, provincial officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new abortion law -- one of the most liberal in the world -- came into effect with the new constitution on February 3, amid acclaim from Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress (ANC) and howls of protest from opposition and religious groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Roman Catholic Church, Dutch Reformed Church and various Islamic groupings have staged frequent and vocal anti-abortion protests, claiming the medical procedure amounts to murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frederik de Klerk's conservative National Party has also steadfastly opposed the liberalization of abortion laws it created during the previous regime, and said that February 3 was a &quot;dark day&quot; for South African morality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the criticism, the ANC last October passed the legislation, which allows all women and girls access to abortions in public institutions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and in the first 20 weeks in certain cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more than a dozen other hospitals have announced they will not be able to perform any abortions at all because they do not have staff willing to be involved in the ethically-controversial procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every year, more than 250,000 women, mostly black, have illegal &quot;backstreet&quot; abortions performed. Of these, at last 425 die in hospital as a result of infections and bleeding, according to official figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, only about 1,000 women who have been raped, become victims of incest, or whose pregnancy poses a danger to their lives, have qualified each year for legal abortions in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of others, however, have had abortions in private clinics that charge an estimated 1,500 rand ($350) or more to have the operations performed discreetly, if illegally.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Torit, Southern Sudan - Fr. Johnson Mutek Akiyo has been appointed the Vicar General of Sudan's Torit Diocese, about 1,200 kilometres south of Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His appointment was announced by the Diocesan Bishop Paride Taban, at the close of the annual general assembly held at the Chukudum Pastoral Centre from February 3 to 7, 1997.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Vicar General, a Sudanese, takes over from Fr. T. Leo, who has retired upon completion of his term of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other appointments made at the assembly attended by delegates from Sudan, Kenya and Uganda were Fr. Victor Okot as the secretary of Torit Diocese, Nairobi office, and Fr. Victor Gira as Parish Priest of Palotaka in the same diocese. The newly ordained Fr. Loum Sunday Joseph, was appointed Fr. Gira's assistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Torit Diocese was established in 1983 and is one of the four Catholic sees in southern Sudan currently under the control of the 0rebel group, Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other dioceses in the war-torn region are Rumbek, headed by Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari, El-Obeid headed by Max Macram Gasis and Tambura Yambio which is headed by Joseph Gasi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPLA which is led by Colonel John Garang, has fought with the Sudanese Islamic Government since 1983, demanding for the establishment of a democratic government that recognises and respects the rights of all Sudanese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's general assembly was opened by Fr. Tim Galvin, an Irish, working with displaced people at New Kush, about 1,500 kilometres south of Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fr. Galvin then handed over to four facilitators who included Fr. Akiyo.  Others were Fr. Dominic Otware, head of Torit's Central Deanery, Mr. Cyprian Okuye, a logistics officer in the diocese and Mrs Theodore A.D. Lotto, the former Diocesan Executive Secretary in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 50 delegates participated in the assembly, during which several office bearers in the Torit Diocese presented reports on their pastoral activities in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last day of the assembly saw the delegates break into four small discussion groups each with a topic to tackle. The topics included pastoral care, education, relief and health and management and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Fr. Loum, ordained only six months ago, the assembly was quite an eye opener. &quot;I learned a lot since people were very open and exchanged views freely,&quot; he said in a post-assembly interview. &quot;I was happy to learn that the people already in the field know what they are doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A regional committee on refugees meeting here has decried divisions in the Church today, saying such splits make churches speak with many voices, leading to contradictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The East African Refugee Regional Committee, organized here by the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) noted that the region is at cross-roads and full of challenging issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the February 10 to 13 meeting, the AACC Executive Secretary for International Affairs and Coordinator for Refugee and Emergency Services Rev.  Ngoy Mulunda-Nyanga challenged the churches in the conflict torn East African region to review their role of keeping people's hope alive by acting quickly to alleviate suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Mulunda likened the situation in the region to &quot;people crossing a lake when the storms are raging.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told participants drawn from Uganda, Egypt, Ethiopia and Kenya, the raging storm has been felt in Burundi, Sudan, Somalia, Rwanda, and to some extent, Kenya, with Zaire currently going through a similar phase. Djibouti, a member of the regional body was not represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the International Affairs desk regretted that Uganda, which had experienced some rough periods in its history was still going through situations that subject people to suffering but it seems to have been forgotten as little is said about the war in some parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing tribalism and ethnicity as the major factors around which conflicts revolve, Rev. Mulunda however acknowledge that the two were very challenging to Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described identity with a tribe or ethnic group as a holy covenant instituted by God and asserted that the Church should promote that covenant, because belonging to a particular tribe is not bad as &quot;it is our identity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conflicts, Rev. Ngoy said it is wrong to condemn one tribal group against the other as has happened in some countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on the church to preach the ministry of reconciliation, forgiveness and forgetting wrongs done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing out that the message of reconciliation is not being emphasized by the church today, the head of the AACC International Affairs desk wondered whether the church is still capable of standing in the midst of problems and proclaiming reconciliation boldly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also took issue with the slow manner in which churches have responded to conflicts, likening the church to someone riding on a donkey instead of a horse to help save a situation. If churches were quick enough to respond to situations, they would have been able to diffuse some tensions before they exploded and assumed dangerous proportions, Rev. Mulunda added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out of darkness, we are the light of this region and must stress reconciliation even if some governments do not want to accept it,&quot; the AACC official remarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also underscored the need for the church to link up with other groups in dealing with tensions, analyzing and interpreting issues. And went on further to challenge the local churches not to always wait for either the Nairobi- based AACC or other ecumenical agencies in Europe to initiate action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Zewdita Lakew of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (EOC) Refugee and Returnee Affairs Department observed that there was competition between the local and international organizations in providing relief assistance and other projects in conflict areas. She accused international organizations of taking advantage of the local organizations instead of supporting the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her assertion was supported by a Kenyan Methodist clergy who said this kind of competition was very vivid in Kenya and gave as an example a case involving an international agency and a local churches' organization, both providing health assistance in the arid North-Eastern Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the uprooted people, the regional committee said ongoing programmes should be reviewed so as to work towards meeting the needs of the refugees and other uprooted people, especially now that funds are dwindling in the face of emerging priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Henry Odraa Raga from thee AACC Refugee Desk cautioned that funds were no longer easily available from traditional donors, thus the need to tap financial assistance from alternative sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Odraa Raga noted that those charged with the responsibility of alleviating suffering, particularly the regional committees, should work with even more commitment. He suggested that members gain exposure to different situations and develop new insights in their work.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS - A suspected member of a fundamentalist Shiite Muslim group, charged with insulting Nigeria's military ruler, General Sani Abacha, and other prominent officials in the ruling junta has been remanded in custody until February 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bashir Musa, from the Fagge district of Kano, Abacha's hometown in northern Nigeria, was charged at a magistrates court on February 5 with illegal preaching and inciting disturbances, judicial officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor Tijjani Ochej told the court that the accused was arrested on January 30 at a local mosque after heaping abuse on Abacha and the Emir of Kano Alhaji Ado Bayero, the officials said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musa, a tailor by trade, criticized Nigeria's military rulers for refusing to allow the country, which is predominantly Muslim in the north and mainly Christian and animist in the south, and has a secular constitution, to be transformed into an Islamic state, judicial officials added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Ahmed Jijjani Muazu accepted the prosecution's argument that Musa constituted a threat to public order, and remanded the accused in custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the police chief in neighbouring Kaduna state, Yakubu Shuaibu, has warned that Shiite sect members who fled a police crackdown last year could unleash a terror campaign in neighbouring states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Members of the religious sect have abandoned Kaduna, and they could find a conducive atmosphere (for their activities) in some nearby areas,&quot; he told journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shiite sects have increased their profile over the past 17 years in Nigeria, notably in the northern Kano, Kaduna, Sokoto and Katsina states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty-six suspected Shiite sect members arrested last December in Sokoto (north-west) were early last month charged with breach of the peace and unlawful assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were arrested for allegedly criticizing government officials and insulting the Nigerian establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said at least six people were killed and many others were injured following clashes between Shiite fundamentalists and policemen last September in Zaria, a major town in Kaduna state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clashes broke out when fundamentalists demanded the release of their leader, El Zak-Zaki, who was arrested on September 12 following bloody clashes between Muslim fundamentalists and Christians in Kafanchan, in the same state. Two people died and 15 others were injured in those clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the arrest of the Shiite leader, no news of his whereabouts or conditions of his detention has filtered out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONROVIA - The Commander of the ECOWAS intervention force in Liberia, ECOMOG, General Victor Malu, has declared this West African country &quot;safe for elections,&quot; saying they should be held in May as scheduled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports quote General Malu as saying the disarmament of some 60,000 guerrilla fighters had largely been completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His February 10 statement came only two days after what analysts described as a veiled threat from former chief warlord, Charles Taylor of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) if the elections were delayed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disarmament was begun late last November and was expected to be completed on January 31, but due to slow pace at the initial stages, a one- week extension was given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malu said the Nigerian-led force, sent to Liberia in 1990 by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), would now focus on elections, the final stage of a regional peace plan to end seven years of civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the success achieved in the just concluded phase, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Liberians and all parties to this conflict have completely demonstrated their resolve to end this fratricidal crisis,&quot; General Malu is reported as telling a two-day West African army chiefs' meeting in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chiefs-of-staff were to assess the security situation and advise foreign ministers from the nine-nation ECOWAS committee on Liberia, who were due to meet here last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malu told journalists that 91 per cent of armed guerrillas had turned in their weapons by February 7, the end of a voluntary disarmament period and that the country was &quot;safe for elections.&quot; We will be recommending elections nation-wide,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports also indicate that the United States expects to contribute up to $6 million for the elections and its Ambassador to Liberia, William Milan has expressed hope that the timetable would be maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be surprised if they decided not to go ahead with the elections. I believe ECOWAS is committed to the Abuja schedule,&quot; he said in apparent reference to the last peace accord signed in Abuja, Nigeria, last August. &quot;I think that the United States and other donors and supporting countries are also committed to that schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 8, Taylor warned that any attempt by Liberia's donors or the United Nations to shift presidential and legislative elections from next May as scheduled under the Abuja accord, could trigger a crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His NPFL launched the war on Christmas Eve in 1989 against slain military dictator, Samuel Doe and the UN estimates that more than 150,000 people have since been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our side will find it virtually impossible to accept that elections cannot happen in May. We want to make it clear that we have demonstrated our ability to fight a war, disarm our people and demobilize them. They should now give us the opportunity to hold elections,&quot; Taylor told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor's warning follows proposals for free and fair elections prepared by the UN and backed by donors as well as foreign electoral experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say if the proposals are adopted, the polls could be delayed well beyond May. Contained in the proposals are the composition of a new electoral commission, registration of voters and the use of proportional representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPFL leader went on: &quot;Everybody knew about the schedule of the implementation we signed. If there is deception involved, that means that everything is changed. I can tell you this much. When you begin to change things and schedules and plans, you open up a pandora's box. There is a possibility and even a probability of crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - South Africa's gambling industry could be headed for disaster unless the authorities rethink their gambling policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the message given by a group of academics in the Waterfront yesterday after a 20-month long research project funded by Sun International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Kantor, the Dean of the Faculty of Commerce at the University of Cape Town, said the major problem lay within the Gambling Act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the group believed the Act had been promulgated without careful consideration to policy and objectives for the industry and the country as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This had left developers and other interested parties without clear guidelines, and could lead to a situation such as that in Namibia where legislation of the gambling industry had gone &quot;horribly wrong&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's report said that the legislation on licences in Namibia had been passed too quickly without a proper understanding of the &quot;potentially very dangerous&quot; social and economic consequences of an inadequately regulated industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian government had done this in response to pressure from would-be developers and casino operators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result was that there were too many licensed gambling houses, each struggling to remain profitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, the academic team estimated, people were willing to spend (or lose) up to 1 percent of after-tax income on gaming. The Western Cape's potential share of estimated gaming spending was R700 million a year, they said, compared to R1,7 billion in Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research report was particularly critical of the number of licences given to Gauteng, believing that they could wipe out the gambling industry in the North West Province, and still struggle to remain profitable as they competed among themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly you cannot isolate the gambling market in any one province, and cross provincial effects must be taken into account,&quot; Professor Kantor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International experience had shown that gambling was not a tourist market, and that casino income depended largely on local custom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tourism will not drive casino revenues,&quot; Professor Kantor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enormous effort and resources had already been expended on gambling developments in South Africa without the players &quot;knowing the rules of the game yet&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Kantor also said that the licensing authorities should also become &quot;far more prescriptive, in other words follow a process similar to tendering where clear guidelines are set&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Otherwise it is all bound to end up in the courts as has already happened in Mpumalanga.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The African National Congress today welcomed the Truth Commission's decision to disclose names of those who had informed for the apartheid state, saying it would counter a snowballing disinformation campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A delegation of the ANC's national executive and sub-committee on truth and reconciliation met Truth Commission head Archbishop Tutu for talks on this and other issues in Cape Town today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting secretary-general Cheryl Carolus, speaking at a media briefing after the meeting, said the ANC was &quot;very happy&quot; with the decision, because full disclosure was an essential part of the TRC process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Tutu said earlier that those who were to be unmasked would be given 21 days' notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Carolus said the risks of not disclosing the identities of informers were to be seen already in the &quot;mischief and disinformation&quot; in certain media reports, including those which had claimed Defence Minister Joe Modise had been on the payroll of the previous government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another example was reports about Communist Party chief Chris Hani's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Carolus said the ANC had used today's meeting to get clarity from the commission about questions the party would be expected to answer in further submissions and hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had been agreed that the ANC would give evidence at a hearing in May, although detailed written submissions would be made before then to give the commission time to prepare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC had emphasised to the commission that it saw its armed struggle as part of a just war against apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the amnesty applications by Mr Hani's murderers, Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus, had been discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC did not want these delayed, but in fact wanted the matter investigated in depth. &quot;We have indicated already that we believe the murder of Chris Hani was part of a broader plot to undermine the processes underway (at the time of his death).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC earlier made it clear that it wanted full disclosure of the names of those in the media, trade unions and student organisations who had spied for the previous government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa confirmed that the party's demand for disclosure went beyond the names of those now in senior government posts who are said to have been informers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was clear from ANC deputy president Thabo Mbeki's letter to the Truth Commission last week that complete disclosure of all those who had been informers was required, Mr Mamoepa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Truth Commission may subpoena Jacques Hechter, one of six former security police officers applying for amnesty, if he refuses to disclose the identities of his informants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission deputy head Alex Boraine said Captain Hechter, if he refused to co-operate, could be summoned to a behind-closed-doors hearing where he could be forced to disclose the names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ANC submission to the commission last year, it was claimed that more than 600 members of the movement had betrayed their comrades to security police in the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior defence sources have said that the degree of penetration of the liberation movement by the former security forces was high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Destruction of at least some records by military intelligence may complicate efforts to verify claims about turncoats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some records of the pre-1994 National Intelligence Service are also said to have been destroyed or otherwise have gone missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sapa reports that Mr Modise has provided the commission with some leads about who gave the orders for defence force records to be destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of today's ANC delegation to the meeting with Archbishop Tutu included Dullah Omar, Charles Nqakula, Mathews Phosa, Mac Maharaj, Mr Mamoepa, and Mongesi Tshongweni.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonnita marketing-director Marius Kritzinger said his company had been approached by the girl's family and the Goodwood community &quot;who have distributed more than 50 000 posters&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company agreed to the venture after consulting the Child Protection Unit and Liezl-Mari's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of our social responsibility programme is to help communities in distress,&quot; said Mr Kritzinger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sachets will be distributed throughout the Western and Southern Cape and it is estimated that Liezl's photograph will be seen by more than 250 000 people a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From today the picture, a short description of Liezl in Afrikaans and English and the telephone numbers of the Child Protection Unit and Crime Stop will appear on Bonnita sachets of milk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liezl, 13, a pupil at J G Meiring High School, disappeared on January 22 on the way from her Goodwood home to school to attend an athletics practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeks after her disappearance, a man driving a silver BMW tried to lure an eight-year-old girl into his car near where Liezl-Mari is thought to have disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of Goodwood residents called police about a motorist cruising the streets near schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses helped police compile an identikit of the man. Police emphasised he could not be linked to Liezl-Mari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently a man was arrested for trying to lure a Standard 9 pupil into his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child Protection Unit head Jan Swart said the man had several indecent assault cases pending &quot;but we had to release him as no crime was committed on the pupil&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A man who murdered three black Hermanus residents in a killing spree could kill again if he did not have long-term therapy, a psychologist has told the Cape High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Yodaiken was giving evidence in mitigation of sentence for Wilfred Jordaan, 26, of Panorama.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordaan and a 17-year-old youth from Hermanus were convicted yesterday of murdering Catherine de Wet, Eric Mjikiliso and Nkosana Bushula, who were bludgeoned to death with a steering wheel lock. They were also found guilty of assaulting Richmond Qwathikazi. The attacks happened in the Hermanus area on September 2, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Yodaiken, who gave the court a psychological assessment of Jordaan, said he had a dysfunctional family background in which his father beat his wife and had numerous affairs - 77, according to his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordaan's mother was aggressive and hostile towards him and his two siblings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordaan's parents were not &quot;models of self-restraint&quot; and Jordaan was unable to learn to control his impulses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Yodaiken said Jordaan desired the approval of others and would submit to those he perceived to be more important than himself. Jordaan did not have a history of violent or aggressive behaviour, at school or when he was in the navy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had not derived satisfaction from the killings - &quot;I don't think he intended to kill anyone&quot; - but from the camaraderie he felt with the youth, Mr Yodaiken said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was approval (by the youth of his actions) and that's the danger.  He will seek approval from anyone, even a stranger.&quot; &quot;Under the right circumstances he could be led into anything that is the danger of his type of personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Yodaiken said Jordaan would need long-term psychotherapy and imprisonment would be a suitable punishment for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial continues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A vast new project is being planned to unleash an economic boom for impoverished Cape Flats communities and create thousands of jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sheffield Road-Symphony Way road development will link the Philippi area to the Bellville central business district, creating an economic corridor along which major development can take place.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is envisaged the project will create the conditions for attracting businesses to the route, creating employment for thousands of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A project on the R250-million Olympic priority list, the development is one of the main recommendations of the Metropolitan Spatial Development Framework, a key aim of which is to reverse the apartheid era's separation of disadvantaged communities from the city's conventional business districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed development is also crucial for Cape Town's Olympic bid, as it will improve access to and from Philippi, which has been earmarked as the venue for badminton during the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philippi East has been identified as an economic node which will complement the central business districts of Cape Town, Bellville and Claremont-Wynberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrence Smith of Symphony Way Consultants, who are working on the draft designs, said the development formed part of the Cape Metropolitan Council's plan to increase the efficiency of the city's transport network - road and rail - up to 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the consortium had been inundated with calls from developers and other business people about possible investment in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Already a major shopping complex is being planned on the corner of the N2 and Delft Main Road.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed road link will also improve transport for thousands of students at the University of the Western Cape and the Peninsula Technikon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lausanne - We've made it! Cape Town, and the rest of South Africa and Africa with it, have joined the race for Olympic gold in a four/five way contest for the Games of 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's bid came through the tough 11-city selection process with flying colours to join Rome, Athens, Stockholm and Buenos Aires in the gruelling six- month race to the finish on September 5, when the South Africans return to Switzerland for their final date with the International Olympic Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheers of joy, and tears of relief, marked the announcement of Cape Town's inclusion in the shortlist by Marc Hodler, chairman of the IOC selection college, at 2.30pm at the lakeside Olympic Museum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the bid teams, the air of mounting excitement and anticipation was almost unbearable in the run-up to Mr Hodler's announcement at the press conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many, nearly exhausted by months of pressure and hard work, the news seemed almost too good to be true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ecstatic Chris Ball declared: &quot;It's a magnificent achievement for South Africa to be in the finals of this extraordinary competition, particularly so soon after the political transformation of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are enormously encouraged by the extent to which the selection college has acknowledged the technical elements of the bid, because that puts us on an equal footing with all the other cities at the beginning of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the fun and excitement begins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Olympic Committee of SA chief, Sam Ramsamy, beamed: &quot;We are elated and overjoyed. This is a great day for us all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cautioned, though, that &quot;our task only begins now because we are in very tough competition with Rome, Athens, Stockholm and Buenos Aires, and they all have formidable bids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nevertheless I am confident that on September 5 the IOC will give us the Games because our overall package is undoubtedly the best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Sports Minister Steve Tshwete: &quot;This is the greatest piece of news for our country since the elections in 1994. It is a breath of fresh air that will blow across the face of South Africa, southern Africa and the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will stimulate growth, there's no doubt about that...it will stimulate tourism in Cape Town and throughout the region, and revive the commitment to sport among our young people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the time had come when the bid deserved everybody's support. &quot;What we need now is for everyone to rally fully behind the city of Cape Town, the young and old, the rural and urban people, everyone. It is ours to lose, and it is our dream come true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking ahead, Mr Ball said: &quot;There is no one city that can run faster than any other...the result will depend on the reaction of IOC members who visit us and how they see the competitive merits of the various cities in the context of the needs of the IOC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of them will vote parochially, but a lot will stand apart and say: Let's look at what's right for the IOC at this point in history. It is for this reason that we have an extraordinary chance of competing successfully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He paid tribute to the many people in the bid team, in the city, province and government, in Nocsa and the business community, and to the people of Cape Town who had supported and encouraged the bidding exercise. &quot;Now the fun and excitement starts and I hope everyone will assist and participate in what should be a fulfilling six months for South Africa. This will be like day and night cricket every month from now until September.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary Speaker Frene Ginwala said: &quot;This is our opportunity to add something that's really important to the Olympic movement. This is not a reward for what has happened in our past and we must see it as a way to add something new, to show that the Olympic Games can be a vehicle to make a practical difference to people's lives. This is the developmental nature of our bid, and that's what South Africa is all about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ramsamy, Mr Ball and other members of the team went straight into a meeting, as did the other successful teams, with top IOC officials to discuss various technical matters relating to the next phase of the bidding process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bidding effort will intensify dramatically from here on, as the team pulls all the stops to influence IOC voters and make sure perceived weaknesses are effectively tackled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge now is to make the most of the city's chance and pull off the miracle in September of becoming host city for the 2004 Games.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council's chairman, Mars de Klerk, will visit Nelspruit and surrounding towns during a tour of what they term the Drakensberg-Northern District between 5 and 8 March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This region, which includes Mpumalanga and parts of the Northern Province, is one of the areas identified by the Council as having a strong enough Afrikaner population for self-determination to be realised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Towns to be visited by the Council include Ermelo, Nelspruit, White River, Hazyview, Graskop, Blyde River, Ohrigstad, Lydenburg and Dullstroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mpumalanga's Freedom Front (FF) members of the provincial legislature live in Ermelo but were unavailable for comment about the Council's visit or plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Towns such as Nelspruit, Hazyview and White River have an over-whelming majority of black residents, while smaller rural towns such as Dullstroom are holiday/ tourism towns for Gauteng based trout fishermen.  None of the mayors of the towns targeted by the Council wanted to comment about the possibility of finding themselves in an Afrikaner Volkstaat, but a number of mayors did say that had not yet been approached for interviews or discussions on the matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NELSPRUIT - A supposed rescue mission to London earlier this week to save Mpumalanga's controversial R12,2-billion deal with the Dubai-based Dolphin Group may have only added to the public furore surrounding the secret deal, which gave away some of South Africa's key tourist attractions for 50-years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of Mpumalanga's legislative standing committee on public accounts, Chris MacPherson, expressed his reservations about the rescue team's amendments to the deal on Friday, pointing out that the only reason his committee had originally approved the commercialisation of game reserves in the province was to secure private sector funding for the Mpumalanga Parks Board's (MPB) budget. Dolphin's guarantee to contribute roughly R12,2-billion to the MPB over a 50-year period was withdrawn in London on Wednesday, when the South African delegation insisted on various changes to the secret 39- page contract between Dolphin and MPB. One of the core demands was that the contract period be reduced from 50 to 25-years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin agreed to the changes but said that as a result, they couldn't guarantee the whole budget deficit anymore and have instead offered to pay the MPB 7 per cent of turnover from the exclusive commercial development rights granted to them in six State owned game reserve, Blyde River Canyon and Loskop Dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPB needs private sector funding for both its projected budget deficit and its normal operating budget after Mpumalanga's provincial government discovered that it could only give MPB R10,5-million for the 1997/ 98 financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPB had asked for R53-million as an absolute minimum, to cover its personnel and salary expenses - 80 per cent more than government is able to give.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original contract, which was signed without any public consultation by MPB head Alan Gray in November last year, outraged rural communities, land claim activists and conservationists who pointed out that MPB had &quot;sold&quot; national assets for 50-years even though many of the key tourism sites did not fall under MPB control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rural communities also pointed out that they had gazetted land claims on at least three of the core development areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Land claims are only gazetted once the Land Commissioner is certain that they are realistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;rescue&quot; mission to London, headed by Mpumalanga environmental affairs MEC, David Mkhwanazi was put together after central government threatened to step into the furore caused by the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admitting that the MPB had erred by attempting to keep the terms of the contract secret for 50-years, Mkhwanazi convinced Dolphin president, Ketan Somaia, to drop the entire confidentiality clause in the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other &quot;flaws&quot; which have been removed from the original contract include exclusive commercial rights to the Manyeleti Game Reserve and the historic town of Pilgrim's Rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manyeleti, which is described as the last remaining piece of undeveloped &quot; Big Five&quot; bush in Africa, is administered by the Northern Province and not by Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pilgrim's Rest is administered by Mpumalanga's public works department and not by MPB. Although Dolphin is still pledging R410-million investment in the province in 3-years, only 30 per cent of this will be from foreign exchange.  When the deal was first publicly announced, all investment was supposed to be forex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To assist with the reduced budgetary support, Dolphin has now pledged 25 per cent of all its profits to the MPB as well as promising surrounding communities 20 per cent equity stakes in the various joint venture companies which will operate the reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No financial value has been put to these figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The MPB, as a parastatal, is fully accountable to the provincial legislature and we only approved their commercialisation programme because they needed to get private sector funding. If guarantees for the complete underwriting of the deficit have been withdrawn, then MPB has no business signing any deals,&quot; said public accounts chair, Chris MacPherson, on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that the aim had not been to commercialise parks just for the sake of commercialising, MacPherson added that other investors would perhaps be prepared to meet MPB's deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would find it very strange if the MPB, which did not accompany Mkhwanazi to London, accepted being forced into a corner by agreeing to development regardless of the benefits,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacPherson also expressed his concern that Mkhwanazi as MEC had taken control of negotiations, without any MPB consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The MPB is a separate en-Acted parastatal and cannot just be suspended by the MEC or otherwise interfered with unless the legislation governing it is altered by this province's Legislature,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we start allowing MECs or other politicians to ignore the law, then we might as well pack up the legislature and all go home.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EMPANGENI - The South African Student's Congress (Sasco) at the University of Zululand demanded on Tuesday that former president FW de Klerk be stripped of his honoury LLB degree from the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk was awarded the honoury degree in 1995, in recognition for his contributions to the peaceful dismantling of Apartheid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A memorandum setting out the demand was submitted to university management on Tuesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memorandum also demanded the unconditional and immediate registration of 800 unregistered students. Sasco wants the university to use funds earmarked for renovating university buildings to be used to wipe off these student's current debts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Management won't respond (to these demands) as the demands come from a political formation that has no mandate to tackle such issues,&quot; said University's public affairs manager, Mr Carl de Villiers in reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASCO motivated its call for De Klerk to be stripped of his honoury degree by maintaining that De Klerk's government was involved in atrocities against the masses of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Management will only respond to de-mands brought by the Student Representative Council, since it has a legitimate mandate,&quot; said Mr de Villiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the registration deadline for all 800 unregistered students was on March 7 and said that funds allocated for renovations would be used for repairing dilapidated buildings and not to settle debts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECUNDA - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in Mpumalanga has threatened further blockades of border posts with the Kingdom of Swaziland if discussions between Swaziland's government and the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) in Mbabane on Wednesday are not successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SFTU is demanding that the Swaziland government reverse a 1973 royal decree which bans all political parties and is also demanding that the government repeals the current state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu and affiliated unions in Mozam-bique expressed their support of SFTU's demands after the Swaziland government arrested a number of union leaders for insurrection and for orgnaising the four week old strike currently crippling Swaziland's economy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of Swaziland's biggest foreign earners, sugar and forestry are reportedly losing at least R3-million per day because of the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the government refused to release the union leaders this week, Cosatu bused supporters to the Oshoek and Golela border posts on Monday and prevented 36 trucks from using the gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hailing the blockade as a success, Cosatu's spokesperson, Norman Mokoena, denied police allegations on Tuesday that Cosatu demonstrators had intimidated at least two truck drivers at the Oshoek gate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cosatu has never subscribed to intimi-dation and never will. We are here to support SFTU, which also belongs to the South African Trade Union Co- ordinating Council like we do. We will not use violence to get our message across,&quot; he insisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oshoek police inspector, Maureen Britz, however said on Tuesday that Cosatu members led by their assistant secretary general, Zwelinzima Vavi, had repeatedly taunted and intimidated two truck drivers who attempted to cross into Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspector Britz added that although no petition was handed in on the South African side of the border, a 27-point memorandum was handed to the Swaziland government by SFTU members on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in contrast, things were back to normal on Tuesday, with all vehicles passing into and from Swaziland without any interference,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police at the Golela border post also reported that the situation was back to normal by Tuesday, and added that the Cosatu demonstrators there had been bused in from Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police added that no serious cases of intimidation had occurred at Golela but that &quot;very vulgar&quot; language had been used between taxi drivers and demonstrators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Province police spokesperson, Supt Phuti Setati, said on Friday that six suspects had been arrested in connection with the murders and that more arrests were imminent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shoot-out allegedly erupted at the Jane Furse taxi rank on Monday when a Boseka-bo-eja taxi driver resigned from the association and then attempted to force fellow members to join Saldta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taxi driver allegedly also attempted to remove Boseka-bo-eja stickers from the association's taxis and replace them with Saldta stickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Boseka-bo-eja drivers refused to resign, the taxi driver allegedly drew his 9mm pistol, afterwhich the shoot-out erupted between the two taxi associations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More shooting took place at the rank the following day. * Meanwhile, nine badly beaten men, three of whom were treated in intensive care at the Witbank hospital, were released from protective police custody on Friday after Witbank taxi drivers accused them of stealing car radios.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - A R130 000 project aimed at bringing government closer to the people was launched for the first time in Mpumalanga on Thursday.  Premier Mathews Phosa welcomed the project, saying it was &quot;a big step&quot; in allowing communities to look into and participate in government activities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project, launched in Nelspruit by the Institute for a Democratic Alternative for South Africa (Idasa) aims to broaden the Government Information Service (GIS) and to equip pupils with marketable life skills while still at school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Department of Education all schools will eventually be linked by computers, improving the availability of information,&quot; explained Head of Strategic Planning and Development, Joe Magagula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said pupils would enter speech contests to discuss government achievements, and then enter provincial finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve winners drawn from all Education Department districts would then undergo training at the University of Pretoria's Statomet Division, studying research metho-dologies, and survey and data collection for the GIS, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magagula said accurate reports were needed for the smooth integration of the Reconstruction and Development process and that pupils and parents would play a key role in the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The introduction of computers will add value to the education system,&quot; added Project Manager, Sheriff Molefe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said computer training learnt by pupils at school would make them more marketable when seeking jobs. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In court, Mlimi said the shooting took place in a matter of two minutes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kwaggafontein - A freelance investigative journalist working for African Eye news Service in Mpumalanga has laid intimidation charges against five unidentified taxi operators after they threatened him with physical harm on Monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Ngoma (23) was allegedly cornered by two taxi drivers and three taxi owners at the Kwaggafontein Taxi Rank and was told not to report on a court case involving their colleagues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case, currently before the Kwaggafontein Magistrate's Court, involves the assassination of drivers from rival taxi organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These guys cornered me first and then began screaming that they would shoot me and plant a gun on my body to make it look like self-defense. They warned me very unpleasantly to keep out of their business,&quot; said Ngoma afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not the first time that the press or even normal members of the public have been intimidated by taxi operators in the area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men also allegedly warned Ngoma not to attempt to use any local taxis, or come near their rank again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no other form of public transport in the rural areas surrounding Kwaggafontein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial AENS bureau chief, Justin Arenstein, confirmed that rural reporters in Mpumalanga were often intimidated and had their homes attacked after working on relatively routine stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is very little understanding of the role of the media in these areas and reports describing court cases or the like are often viewed as personal attacks on those involved,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result, we often have to rotate our reporters and also have a standing rule that journalists from trust or rural areas don't report on their home territories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual journalists in Mpumalanga have also been subjected to verbal abuse at press conferences, in official government press releases and in the provincial legislature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Running at altitude, South African athletes are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">going to struggle to beat the qualifying marks for the world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">championships</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AFRICA'S top athletes go to Potchefstroom's peculiarly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shaped Kenneth McArthur Oval this weekend knowing that a national</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">title along with a performance which betters Athletic South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's (ASA) qualifying standards will automatically gain them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">selection in the squad for August's world championships in Athens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend's South African track and field championships come</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a month earlier than usual this year. The move forward is to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provide more time to prepare properly for the world championships,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and although ASA will allow qualification until the end of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">season in April, those athletes who have recorded their marks by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this weekend will have nearly five months to lay the foundations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for Athens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the tightly packed stands around Potchefstroom's track</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provide for a great atmosphere it is surprising that it has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chosen as the venue for the world championships trials. As an</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">altitude venue (1 351m) ASA's reward for victory with a qualifying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mark is clearly discriminatory against the middle-distance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">athletes and race walkers. Even though ASA has indicated that it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will adjust accordingly for altitude in the explosive events,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there is no chance of anybody recording a qualifying mark in an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">event beyond 800m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just the Engen Grand Prix final in Cape Town on April 8</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remaining as a coastal event this season, ASA runs the risk of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sending an all-white team to Athens as nobody has yet qualified in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the middle- distances. Of course, it should be a mere formality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for Olympic silver medallist Hezekiel Sepeng to make the grade in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the 800m but should the wind blow on April 8 in Cape Town there is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">very little chance of any other black athletes joining him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, so far only six athletes have qualified for Athens and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with altitude conversions two of those fall away. Llewellyn</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herbert's 49.27 400m hurdles time in Pretoria equates to a 49.68</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at sea level while Johan Venter's 10.24 100m time - also in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria - converts to 10.33. Ironically both these conversions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are better than the IAAF's &quot;A&quot; standard but not the far more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stringent ASA standards - 49.30 and 10.25 respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even sprint queen Adri de Jongh loses her 22.82 200m qualifier</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Pretoria which falls eight hundredths of a second shy of ASA's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mark of 22.94 but comfortably inside the IAAF's 23.24. She at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">least has the consolation of making the cut with her best 400m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time of the season of 50.91 at the Test match in Pretoria. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conversion to 51.31 is still better than ASA's standard of 51.54.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other three qualifiers are Okkert Brits and Riaan Botha in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the pole vault and Burger Lambrechts in the shot put. The throws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and vertical jumps are not considered to have an advantage at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">altitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most South African competitors in the sprint events and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">horizontal jumps are unwilling to admit that altitude improves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their performances, scientific evidence - not to mention that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provided by the likes of Bob Beamon, Jim Hines, Lee Evans, Pietro</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mennea et al - suggests differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASA is therefore right to apply altitude conversion factors to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">qualifying marks in the interests of fairness but the middle-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distance athletes have still not had a fair bite at the cherry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because the IAAF doesn't allow qualifying marks which have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">converted down from altitude marks in the distance events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So although there will be some exciting contests in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potchefstroom over the weekend there are unlikely to be too many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">athletes who will qualify for Athens once the selectors have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finished with their calculators. In the 100m and 200m Western</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Province youngster Marcus la Grange will be out to usurp the more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seasoned reputations of Johan Venter and Shaun Powell. The men's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sprints are difficult races to call but if any of these athletes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">want to go to Greece they will have to dip under 10.14 in the 100m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and 20.36 in the 200m which is very fast sprinting by local</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 400m will also be a close race with Arnaud Malherbe the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">favourite to win but he will be pushed all the way by Liod</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgopeng, Hendrick Moganyetsi, Alfred Visagie and Herman de Jager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Llewellyn Herbert should win easily and he will be looking for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a time of 48.90, but among the women only Adri de Jongh looks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">capable of getting another qualifying time in the sprints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hezekiel Sepeng will race the 800m and he will hope to pull</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">training partners Johan Botha and Jurgens Kotze under the 1:45.60</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standard. Sepeng's main rival, Marius van Heerden, will race the 1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">500m after coming back from injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New national high jump record holder Gavin Lendes jumped 2.27m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Port Elizabeth last month and must improve by one centimetre to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">satisfy ASA. Discus throwers Frits Potgieter and Frantz Kruger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will have to improve their personal bests to reach the 62.50m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">qualifying distance while Philip Spies will need to have fully</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recovered from his back problems to go over 82.00m. ark in Port</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth next weekend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - OOPS! You're barely round the first circuit of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the interview and you're off the track already. All those good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intentions to steer a straight line along a route of technical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interrogation, bluffing furiously about gear shifts, aerodynamic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">force, fuel loads, go up in smoke as you give into temptation and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plough straight into the wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the Basil Fawlty syndrome, the twitch not to mention the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obvious. You can't help it, though. The only really interesting</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thing to ask a 21-year-old rather stern- faced German who's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scarcely out of short trousers, has never driven in a grand prix,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lives in the antiseptic world of Monaco, and has a personal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manager at his side to tend to his needs, is just how difficult it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be to become the best racing driver in the world when you're</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not even the best racing driver in your own household.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By far the biggest task Ralf Schumacher will face this weekend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and beyond is coping with the relentless fascination with his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">surname. Not only has he got the name, Schumacher junior has also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">got the same mannerisms, the same self-possessed, distant air, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">same pale blue-eyed, elongated features, the same everything in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fact - management team, fitness schedules, diet and, above all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">else, attitude. On the fast track to fame and glory, Ralf has all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the detached, contained, confident characteristics of his brother,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael, seven years his senior. Has Ralf, though, got his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ability?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the question which will taunt him throughout the season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's already shown that he can be testy when quizzed excessively</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the subject. As a result some have marked him down as a cold</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fish, a rather remote, humourless figure, too hard- nosed and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inscrutable by half. It's too easy (and too early) to snatch at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the stereotype. Even though there was a resigned slump of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shoulders when our interview veered towards the subject, there was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enough sensitivity and honesty in his responses to suggest that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his thought processes have not yet completely switched over to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">automatic, and begrudging, transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a positive side to being a Schumacher, for sure,&quot; he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said last week, idling away the time in the Jordan garage at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silverstone while the mechanics wrestled with the snag which had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">aborted the morning practice session. &quot;It brought me into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael's management team, where Willi Weber gave me an early</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chance to run in a good F3 team. Sponsors, too, probably came more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is a downside. I make a mistake, like all young</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drivers, and it's because I'm arrogant, because I think I can do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it all. Maybe some drivers think I got the rides because of who I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">am, not what I do. That's their view. For me, it's just not a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">problem. My name is Schumacher. In the end I am accepted because I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">am a racing driver, not because I have a good name.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His team boss, Eddie Jordan, an irrepressible Dubliner whose</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">patter, push, roguish charm and fast-talking ways capture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">perfectly the rock 'n roll, high-finance mix of the sport, rejects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any notion that he was drawn to the name rather than the driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing whatsoever to do with it,&quot; says Jordan. &quot;The name meant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nothing. The same as when Senna da Silva first arrived here in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1982. The same too with Damon Hill. They're guys who I fancied to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">go places. I don't see it as a gamble at all. Our best results</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have always come from younger drivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralf brings an enormous amount of speed with him. He has a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">long, long way to go before he gets anywhere near his brother's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">level. But all the evidence suggests that he has indeed got his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">talent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ralf Schumacher does not want to take part in the comparison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">game. It's a wise move. They are too far apart in age for there to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have been any significant sibling rivalry when growing up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want to prove that I am me, that's all,&quot; he says. &quot;But</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have no problem with Michael's status, that's for sure. He is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the best Formula One driver in the world. I would say that even if</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he were not my brother. It's obvious. My aim is not particularly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to beat him, nor to try and jump out of his shadow. I simply don't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have a problem with all that. My results will make me my own man</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or not. That's all I care about - good results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His results so far have been impressive, enough to have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attracted the eagle eye of Jordan, a man renowned along the pit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lane for his shrewd investments. Ralf Schumacher revved his way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through the traditional apprenticeship of karting. He won several</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">karting titles before making his F3 debut with the WTS team in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1993. As he himself admits, doors which other youngsters would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have had to take a crowbar and jemmy to, opened for him because of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995 he won the F3 World Final in Macau. He moved to the Far</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">East last year to compete for the Le Mans team in the All Nippon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F3000 championship, the demanding testing ground for all young</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wannabes. The Schumacher wannabe won the championship at his very</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To go to Japan and survive is some achievement,&quot; says Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To go there and win a race is unbelievable. To go there and win</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the title is unheard of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a guarded, prosaic, individual, is Ralf Schumacher, which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doesn't make him a bad man. &quot;No, I'm not at all romantic about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what I do,&quot; he says. &quot;It is my job to go fast, that is all. I'm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not too wound up about coming into Formula One. It's the same</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">experience as other forms of racing. You want to go quickly, that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is your only thought. It's just a job. There was a moment, though,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when I was testing and Michael was nearby and it suddenly sank in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that here we were, two brothers and yet among the very best in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">world. But I don't dwell on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comparison will stalk Ralf this season. It's unlikely to floor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">him. His entourage will see to that. So too will his brother. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">may well bridle at the incessant coupling of his name with that of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his illustrious elder. There is no question, however, of him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">denying his own past. Quite the opposite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael has helped me since I was young,&quot; says Ralf. &quot;He still</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">does. If I need advice, on a circuit or even on the car, then it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is to Michael I turn. He will answer me. He has no problem with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that. If he were new to F1 and I were new then maybe there would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be tension. I don't know. What I do know is that we are close. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fact we have never been closer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a simple statement. Yet it tells you all you need to know</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about the Schumacher brothers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the Grand Prix season opens in Melbourne on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday, Villeneuve has the hot car while frustrated Hill needs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heavenly help to defend the title</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT is at times such as this that grand prix teams, struggling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to make final preparations for the new season, remember 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigel Mansell had joined Ferrari and his chances of finishing the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first race seemed as unlikely as suggesting that Damon Hill,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">penniless at the time and without a decent drive in the junior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">formulae, would one day become world champion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mansell's Ferrari, sporting the revolutionary semi-automatic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gearbox which is now de rigueur in Formula One, could barely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manage a lap before breaking down. During the warm-up for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first race, in Rio de Janeiro, the Ferrari ground to a halt once</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more and Mansell booked himself on an early flight home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He missed his plane because, against all odds, he won. Hill</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would be delighted to offer his travel agent a similar excuse on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday in Melbourne once the dust has settled on the opening round</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the championship. The chances are, however, that he will make</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his flight with time to spare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve months ago, Hill was the only driver in the top six to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have stayed put, the rest having compromised their chances by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">swapping teams. Now it is Hill who is suffering the effects of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">upheaval after being rejected by Williams-Renault and finding a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">place at Arrows-Yamaha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill was impressed by the promise of this middle-order team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">once they had come under the authoritative command of Tom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walkinshaw Racing but, judging by the relentless sequence of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">problems - culminating in a structural failure during the final</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">test at Silverstone last Wednesday - the potential is long-term,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and a far cry from the consistency and competitiveness Hill had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been accustomed to during his four years with Williams. At this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rate of going, the reigning champion will be lucky if he finishes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Australian Grand Prix, never mind winning it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill's frustration had been exacerbated by the news pages of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the motor sport press as they carried weekly reports on the fast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lap times achieved by the latest Williams almost from the moment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it made its track debut. Whereas Hill's first outing, delayed by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two days, was a single lap in the dusk at Silverstone, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams was shown to the press in Didcot and, 48 hours later, was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shattering the unofficial lap record during the course of a 72-lap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">run in Barcelona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some respects, it is unfair to draw a comparison between the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two teams. There is much to be done at Arrows, and Walkinshaw will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">address the problems by employing a similar formula to his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">successful remedy five years ago at Benetton, but the immediate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shortcomings simply underscore the culture shock which Hill will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">probably have to endure throughout the 17-race season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it's too easy, then I'm really not interested,&quot; said Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I need to put myself under extreme pressure, because something</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seems to happen which takes me to another level. And every time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it's happened, and I've been under such pressure, I've driven like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've never driven before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who has witnessed Hill's fortitude during the past few</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years would agree but, equally, they would understand the degree</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of difficulty on this occasion when he damns the Arrows with faint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">praise by saying: &quot;The car's great, it's just a bit on the slow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It almost goes without saying that Hill's old firm are the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">favourites to win the drivers' championship and take the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constructors' title for a record ninth time. Jacques Villeneuve,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who finished a close second in the championship last year, is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ready to capitalise on the lessons learned during his first season</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and he should have the measure of Hill's replacement, Heinz-Harald</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frentzen. The former Sauber driver has the inherent speed but it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remains to be seen whether his suspect temperament can withstand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the demands of a team who go into every race expecting to win -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1997 will make or break Frentzen's reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three remarkable wins in a poor car last year, Michael</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schumacher has nothing to prove. The quality of racing this year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will depend on whether Ferrari give the former champion a decent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The early signs are that the 1997 model is better than last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year's - which is not saying much - and, even if Schumacher is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taking the fight to Williams, he may face stiffer opposition from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">within his own team now that Eddie Irvine has finally been allowed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to get some test mileage under his belt. Irvine has been the first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to recognise the impact made on Ferrari's haphazard technical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisation by the arrival of Ross Brawn, the placid Englishman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who helped bring Benetton and Schumacher two championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Benetton-Renault suffer even further now that Brawn has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">followed Schumacher to the Italian team? Probably not, because it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is difficult to sink any lower than failing to win a single race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as reigning world champions last year. Benetton put that down to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fact that their drivers, Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi, were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">settling in and ridding themselves of bad habits picked up while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">racing for Ferrari for a number of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a productive test campaign is anything to go by, the team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from Oxfordshire are now working as a very efficient unit. Berger,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the most experienced driver in the field, could be the dark horse,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">since this is possibly his last chance to win the championship. On</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a good day, Alesi is capable of beating Berger and matching</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schumacher, but only if he allows his head to rule his massive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If points were awarded for appearance, then McLaren-Mercedes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benz would be unopposed, the silver and grey colour scheme showing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">off the latest car to stunning effect. McLaren, also fast during</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">testing, are ready to win with two experienced and hungry drivers,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard. But exactly the same thing was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said this time last year, and the former champions went on to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finish their third season in succession without a victory and then</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lose their sponsor, Marlboro, thus ending a 23-year association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same applies to Jordan-Peugeot, the team who have led the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">second division for too long without making any impact on the top</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">four. Eddie Jordan has taken the biggest gamble of the lot by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">signing two young drivers at a time when he desperately needs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">someone with the experience of winning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan may find stiff competition from Ligier, the French team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">having been acquired by the former champion Alain Prost. Ligier's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">competitiveness will come not just from the powerful Mugen-Honda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">engine but, on occasions, from their Bridgestone tyres, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">therein lies the one factor which could make all of the foregoing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">look foolish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After four years as sole supplier in Formula One, Goodyear will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have competition from the Japanese tyre company. The problem is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that no one knows how competitive Bridgestone will be, least of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all Goodyear. Even if Bridgestone produce a tyre which is fast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">during the single qualifying session on Saturday afternoon, it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remains to be seen whether or not it is capable of withstanding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the abuse dealt out during the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is almost certain, however, that Bridgestone has a rain tyre</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which is superior to Goodyear's offering, in which case a wet race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will give teams such as Stewart-Ford and Lola-Ford, Ligier,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minardi-Hart and Arrows a performance advantage they might not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">otherwise have had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Damon Hill is seen looking to the heavens this season, it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be in search of divine intervention as his only hope.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - TO call Auckland awesome is akin to predicting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the onset of nightfall. It is on performance against the reigning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Super 12 champions - even without skipper Zinzan Brooke - that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other sides in the competition will be measured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, Helgard Muller's Free State will be awaiting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday's opening game of a crowded weekend programme of tri-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">national provincial series matches with some trepidation. They</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">face the prospect of a second home defeat inside a week in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opening Super 12 meetings after going down to Transvaal at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free State Stadium last Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, that said, in the Free State pattern, there remains much</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that is good about this country's rugby. They approach the game in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the knowledge that their reserves and resources are limited when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">measured against the other South African sides in the competition,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and lay what they have directly on the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against the might of Auckland, doubtless still smarting from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the last-minute Henry Tromp try that earned Northern Transvaal a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thrilling 40-40 draw at Loftus Versfeld last weekend, only the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">brave or the foolhardy would predict a win for the home side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free State run the ball willingly and scrum hard. But then so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do Auckland. The second of flyhalf Carlos Spencer's tries last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weekend demonstrated exactly that. They won the ball from a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turnover and then let it travel through the hands across the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">length of the field for seven points that never looked to be on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Northerns showed the grit to come back in that hugely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">physical second half and level the match in the dying seconds,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says much for the seeds of a revival of the province's fortunes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">under the guiding hand of Kitch Christie. There are still great</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gaps that the man who led this country to World Cup success has to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cement closed. Not least of these is the facility to think and act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">faster and to make the first-time tackles that really count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, following the player revolution which ousted coach John</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams and his assistant Eugene van As, there are all the signs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there that Northerns will soon be one of South Africa's rugby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">powerhouses again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They get the chance to prove it in Pretoria on Saturday against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queensland. The pride of Australia suffered the humiliation of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">going down in their opening match against the Brumbies of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian Capital Territories (ACT)last weekend. Queensland had a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">somewhat indifferent start to last year's campaign, but got better</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as the competition wore on. They represent a tough hurdle for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northerns and another gauge of upward progress in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Durban, Natal take on an injury-hit Otago team in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opening fixture at a time when the team who ended up as losing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finalists are reshaping their line-up, with Steve Atherton and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Allen now overseas and James Small a permanent resident in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town. Otago, who upset Natal last year, will be without the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">services of Josh Kronfeld, To'o Vaega, Stu Foster, Sion Culhane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and John Blaikie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the other game this weekend take on ACT at Ellis Park. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brumbies have proved one of the surprise packages of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tournament though meeting Transvaal on home soil should prove too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">much for them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">though comes in the manner of that defeat. In this context, Hansie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronje and his band of battered South Africans will have no joy in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the reliving of the emphatic hiding they were handed by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australians at the Wanderers this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In anyone's lexicon of failure, this performance must rate as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as dismal an offering as the second innings of the first Test this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country played coming out of isolation at the Kensington Oval in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bridgetown, Barbados.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fired by Andrew Hudson's superb 163 in the first innings, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africans needed to get just 79 runs with eight wickets in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hand on the final day to reach the 201 required for victory. South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa fell 52 runs short, and an expectant nation on the other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">side of the world shook their heads in utter bewilderment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The innings and 196-run defeat at the Wanderers is a far more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">complex and disappointing tale. In Bridgetown, the side was a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collection of raw players. Only Kepler Wessels had played Test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cricket and the West Indians had seldom surrendered a Test in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbados. There was also the small matter of batsmen of the class</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Des Haynes and Brian Lara, as well as a pace attack spearheaded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Courtney Walsh and Curtley Ambrose to consider as mitigating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">factors in defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the start of the long journey Wessels undertook to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">instil a fighting spirit in the South Africans and mould a team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that, while it may not have glittered with superstars all the way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through, played as a cohesive and intractable unit. More</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">importantly, the introvertedly dour and oft-maligned Wessels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">instilled in his side the twin cricketing virtues of application</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and concentration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was this ethos that Cronje adopted when his turn came as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">captain. On to this he grafted the lightness, attacking spirit and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sheer enjoyment of the world's most glorious game that seemed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be missing from the Wessels make-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a joyous mix. But, somewhere along the line, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understanding that playing the game at the top level is about hard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">graft - to return again to the Wessels philosophy - has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">diluted. At the Wanderers, this, more than anything else, showed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came strikingly home from the moment Hudson unthinkingly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sparred at the fourth ball he faced from Glenn McGrath and made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his way back to the pavilion without a run to South Africa's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGrath exploited the overcast conditions to the full, setting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the platform for the Australians in a devastating opening spell of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">three wickets for 10 runs in 10 overs. It was seam bowling out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the top drawer, a signal exercise in concentrated professionalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the light of subsequent play his contribution was somewhat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">diluted, but by gutting a suspect top order and leaving the home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">side reeling at 15 for three, the lanky McGrath all but won the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Test right there and then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also a performance that left an important question to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">answered. If the Wanderers pitch was so flat and lifeless - and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this factor cannot be disputed in good faith - how was it that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGrath and, in a supporting role, Jason Gillespie, were able to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exploit it and the collective might of Allan Donald, Shaun Pollock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Lance Klusener could not, except for isolated patches?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, it is also interesting to note that Aussie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">skipper Mark Taylor took his seamers on faith and kept an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attacking field of eight men in catching positions throughout the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">early part of a first day that always presaged South African ruin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the batsmen, only Cronje, still way off his best form, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the evergreen Dave Richardson made any real impression. Cronje,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the echoes of the Wessels work ethic doubtless ringing in his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ears, put his head down and worked at building some sort of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">batting phoenix from the ashes which lay about him. Richardson,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">helped by some heartwarming insolence from Paul Adams, gave what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he always has for his country ... everything he has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the rest, the South African batting faltered to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deceive. Daryll Cullinan, suffering the rush of blood that he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suffers from so often and offering a poor shot in the middle of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">real class stroke-making; Jacques Kallis, learning the painful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lesson that, against Test-class seam, cricket is indeed a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">physically hurtful game; and Shaun Pollock looking imperious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before letting the wilder part of his nature tempt him into an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">injudicious swish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also led to the cruel observation from one member of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crowd that if 100 runs is called a century, 10 runs should be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">called a Hudson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not a pretty sight. Neither, from a South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">perspective at least, was the third day after the home side had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">battled back to a position where they just might have climbed back</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into the match on day two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Australia ending their Saturday on 191 for four, the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African first innings total of 302 looked a touch more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">respectable. But then Sunday dawned and between them, Greg Blewett</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Steve Waugh began rewriting the Wanderers record books in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mammoth 385-run partnership that never even vaguely looked like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being troubled, let alone broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the comfort of retrospect, it poses another pertinent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">question for the South Africans. If Blewett and Waugh could bat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all day - and then some - on the Wanderers track, why could the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last six batsmen in the home side's second innings not last a full</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">session?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer to that is probably threefold. The first part of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">equation stems from the psychological battering that interminable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">days in the field with little if no reward engenders, the second,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the resurgence of the Shane Warne genius. But the third leg is by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">far the most worrying ... a lack of application that would never</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have been allowed to happen under a man such as Wessels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cannot have escaped the attention of the present side that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Atherton batted his dismal England side to a draw last season</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in somewhat similar circumstances. His 185 not out in that epic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stand with Jack Russell stood as the biggest total at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanderers until Blewett's 214 gave him the honour of being the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only double centurion on the country's premier ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It needed some of the grit that Atherton showed for South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa to make a fight of it. And yes, while the largely unloved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">England captain did not have to fend off Warne's genius for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">producing the unplayable, he went out and did a job of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warne is an exceptional bowler and it is to be celebrated that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he has found himself again following surgery which seemed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">curtail his wiles of late. For, while the way he and fellow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spinner Michael Bevan wrought havoc on the morning of the final</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">day could hardly have been greeted with much enthusiasm in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African dressing-room, cricket in general needs the beacon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of genius to light it now more than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Adams we have a spinner who bowled well, but hardly as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">penetratively as Warne or Bevan. But such is the nature of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">buzzy youngster from the Cape Flats that he will have learnt some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">important lessons from the Australians in general, and Warne in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">particular, about the craft of bowling at this level</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kallis, another of the emergent young brigade, will have also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taken home some revision work. He learnt in the first innings that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the body is a bigger - and more painful - target than the wickets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second, he will have discovered that there is peril in not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">watching a Warne delivery every last centimetre of its tricky</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trajectory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both examples given are just two of many throughout the course</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the match that illustrate the chasm that exists between the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">application of the Australians and the lack of it from their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beaten opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is much work to do for the South African side before the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">second Test starts at St George's Park in Port Elizabeth next</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weekend. Perhaps even on the local variation of the rain dance,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for even the storm Cronje and company must have been praying so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fervently for, arrived a day late.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Try these PCReview books, writes BARBARA LUDMAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE boffins who write the Mail &amp; Guardian's PCReview supplement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have now turned out an entertaining series of guides to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">computer age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First up is Irwin Manoim's Buying the Right Computer (R49,95);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">next comes Mish Middelmann's The Lowdown on Windows 95 (R54,95);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and then one moves to Arthur Goldstuck's The SA Internet Services</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Directory (R44,95). Still to come: Gus Silber on software for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manoim, editorial director of the daily Electronic Mail &amp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian - Africa's first electronic newspaper - set up the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">world's first commercial newspaper produced entirely by desk-top</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">publishing when he and Anton Harber founded The Weekly Mail in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that Manoim knew what he was doing. &quot;When I bought my first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">computer,&quot; he confesses in the book, &quot;I was delighted by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">magnificent price I'd clinched, over a thousand rands cheaper than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the identical machine from a store down the road. I was lugging my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">boxes to the car boot when a thought struck me: 'Where's the box</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the monitor?' 'Oh,' said the dealer, 'the monitor is never</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">included in the price.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many years later, the monitor is still often not included in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the price ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manoim first saw a monitor - that's the bit with the screen -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the Sunday Times in 1977, where he was supporting himself as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">low-ranking sub-editor while trying to finish a master's thesis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they introduced computers to the Sunday Times there was a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">horrified reaction. They made everyone go on a course with an exam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the end and said anyone who failed would be fired.&quot; Manoim was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the only sub who took this idle, obviously jocular threat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seriously, and the only one who passed. So, he - a 23-year-old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">junior in a sea of men whose ages ranged from 50 to 70 - was the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only one who got a computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result of the fact that I was the only one at the paper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who could use a computer, I rose at extraordinary speed because I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">became indispensable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The guide fits pretty well into the same category, for people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about to go boldly into a computer shop for the first time and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confront a 19-year-old computer salesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You think it's easy to buy a computer? &quot;It's not just a matter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of buying a brand name. You're buying a set of specifications, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that makes it tricky. You have to know a bit about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are quite a few simple guides to computers available,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but they invariably confuse simple with simpleton and are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">generally aimed at either children or retarded Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The target audience for his guide is &quot;people accustomed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reading long screeds in the Mail &amp; Guardian, people who manage to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hold down responsible jobs and bring up their children but are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frightened of video recorders or cellphones and, most of all,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">computers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's also aimed at people who can use a bit of humour in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lives. It's a very entertaining book, whether explaining how the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">microprocessor runs its kingdom from a palace that resembles a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">squashed matchbox, or advising readers on what kind of monitor to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">buy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the computer has been bought and the 19-year-old salesman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has talked you into a Windows 95 operating system, it's time for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Middelmann's book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Middelmann was a science teacher once upon a time and knows how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to explain arcane but vital concepts. Founder and director of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Praxis Computing, he's an expert on networking, ie getting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">computers in an office to talk to one another. And he's got a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">radio programme on computers on Johannesburg's Radio 702.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also masquerades as Dr Byte in PCReview, responding to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agonised queries of readers whose operating systems have seized up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- or, lately, readers who have bought Windows 95 and can't for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">life of them get it to work. Thus the book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copiously illustrated with pictures of screens, command fields</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and other bits you have to see to understand, the book takes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ordinary computer users step-by-step through the system, from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">setting the date to choosing the right options; which add- ons are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">worthwhile and which you should avoid; those updates that have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been making internet connections and e-mail work much better; how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">much disk space you should leave free so the system has room to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are zillions of choices for everything. I've picked the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ones that work,&quot; says Middelmann, thus saving the reader time and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frustration. &quot;The main thing is to get control of your computer,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rather than to have it control you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're looking to take off into cyberspace and want to find</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a company to help you design a Web page, provide a link- up to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">internet, train you or your staff; if you're looking for an</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - CHILDREN OF THE DIASPORA AND OTHER STORIES OF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXILE by Mbulelo Vizikhungo Mzamane (Vivlia, R42,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NAKED SONG AND OTHER STORIES by Mandla Langa (David Philip,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R59,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBULELO MZAMANE'S title for his collection cues us in - his are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">largely stories that look back to the days of the struggle, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">most are set in the countries of exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandla Langa's stories take us up to the present (up indeed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the president's prostate operation); his first-person narrators</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">take note of the amaGents in their gravymobiles; they comment,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">too, on how easy it is to throw stones at the new democracy. Yet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all his stories dive back continually, imperatively, to the years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exile, as Mzamane records, is times of fear and anxiety, jaw-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">locking boredom, frustration at the stalling of the struggle, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">internecine squabbling with comrades. It is also unexpected</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">victories: in Welsh Interlude, the narrator achieves a union of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interests between Xhosa and (his hosts) the Welsh, both up against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the suffocation of their culture by the English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some readers these stories will not do what they want</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stories to do. Mzamane's writing is uncompromisingly didactic. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">places, his use of expository dialogue is hard to live with: it's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">easier to take an invisible narrator expounding political</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">realities - even if she or he's a bit stiff - than a pair of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wooden characters doing likewise. But to reject his didactic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">narrative technique out of hand (and some readers are likely to,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially given his priorities in truth-telling) would amount to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a sterile, narrowing view of what fiction can do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana Interlude, for example, is not so much a tale as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">space, sketchily defined, within which Mzamane can record material</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relating to the struggle: the lives of South Africans escaped to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana, one a Sowetan student, one an activist who has to flee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after spying, hidden in a dustbin, on Zulu hostel workers planning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What comes across, what Mzamane records for us, is the exiles'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dedication, tough realism, and great, if precarious, courage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mzamane's narrators speak directly of the past, as it happens;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langa's gaze back at the past. And &quot;no one can imagine what we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">went through&quot;, says one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The narrators of the stories in The Naked Song audibly grapple</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for an overview that eludes them. In The Dead Men Who Lost Their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bones, Clementine targets her telling on the question of how her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">father died, and in Chukwa a train of associations leads from an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">account of a drunkard father's love for his son to the drowning of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a wealthy British madwoman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here Langa's key witnesses confront not only the violence of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the state and of those who were/are its beneficiaries, but -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inextricable from this - the sense of a terrifying indeterminacy:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">life on a tightrope of razor-wire, above a barely measurable void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the struggle to get at least something of this across emerges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in stories that mostly dispense with tightly ordered narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the title of a story here doesn't necessarily tell you much</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about its contents or its intentions: the title here is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">starting-point for a string of fragmentary recognitions, from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lives that are prevented from adding up to more than the sum of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detail is harrowing enough (the bludgeoning to death by a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">farmer of a chicken thief, the hideous death of a boy working in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ship's engine-room in the Durban docks); the occasional statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of overview is gripping, and not unreasonable to read as spoken</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">straight by Lange - especially in the record of exile, which is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">packed with detail igniting with the sense it must be released (as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the stories of Mzamane).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langa does lighten up: A Gathering of Bald Men is charged with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suspense and surprise and is sharply, sourly funny. This is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">skill that Mzamane also has: when, in one story, newly conscripted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portuguese soldiers in Mozambique are ordered to shoot any</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">potential bearer of weapons, they find themselves confronted by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">old men and little boys - and, so, are confounded by &quot;the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">semiotics of age&quot;. (Still they start shooting.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might feel there is just too much packed into some of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stories in The Naked Song - but then Langa manages to communicate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with fierce intensity how it is all too much. Try There Are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virgins in the Township: I can't think of any story I have read</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for quite some time that culminates with such poignancy and such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">force.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">yourself tied in with Liberty's new range of Indian cushions,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reflects Talvin Singh with a grimace. Tabla player, DJ, club</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">promoter and now label boss, Singh is talking up his new</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(released by Omni/Mango Records in February), while talking down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its connections to the current upsurge of young Anglo-Asian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to understand Singh's concern. What with Kula Shaker</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turning Vedic chants into chart hits, Babylon Zoo's Jas Mann</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">becoming the first Indian in space, Birmingham's Bally Sagoo on</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">permeating pop culture in a way it hasn't since the Beatles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discovered kaftans and sitars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 27-year-old Singh, however, is wary of becoming part of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this season's novelty phenomenon. For one thing, he's a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">classically trained musician, having left his native Leytonstone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the age of 15 to spend two years studying in the Punjab. In the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years since, he's ducked and dived his way through bhangra, jazz,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hip-hop and Indian classical music, amassing an awesome list of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">playing credits en route. Among others, he's hammered his tablas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for Bj&quot;rk, Massive Attack, Courtney Pine and even the late</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American jazz giant Sun Ra, who dedicated a tune, Singh's Thing,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to his accompanist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jazz was an open door for me,&quot; he says, &quot;the only music that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowed me the freedom I wanted.&quot; These days, Singh finds his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">freedom in a giddy blend of Indian and Western influences in which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fizz and the boom of drum'n'bass collides with tabla</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">breakbeats and Indian raggas. Anokha, the club night he hosts at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London's Blue Note every Monday, has helped redefine Anglo- Asian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">identity with an aesthetic that is carried over to the Anokha</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">album, a compilation of names such as State of Bengal and Future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soundz of India. Singh's own album is also under construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People call the music that we make a fusion of several</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elements,&quot; says Singh, &quot;but as people we already are those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elements - we're already fused!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly the music on Anokha represents a leap forward from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the sometimes crude weld of Western rhythms and Eastern melodies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you find on the &quot;world rave&quot; circuit: a reflection, in part, of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Singh's knowledge of Indian tradition. For him, the East is a fact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of life rather than a piece of borrowed exotica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same, of course, is true for India itself, which has taken</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the new hybrids emerging from the old imperial homeland with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gusto that explains why major labels are now pricking up their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commercial ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A clear sign of shifting attitudes is that Amar, a 17-year-old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">female vocalist discovered in Southall by Singh and Bj&quot;rk, and who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sings the beguiling Jaan that opens Anokha, has just been snapped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up by Warners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've never wanted to make music whose only outlet would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through Asian shops,&quot; says Talvin Singh, &quot;or to be filed under</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">world music. &quot;I want to feel I could make an Indian classical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">record and have it in the pop section. I just want to be filed</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Indian film and music is reinventing itself,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">invading Western fashion and creating heated debate back home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOST in the West know little about Indian cinema, one of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">oldest, most varied, largest and most glamorous entertainment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industries in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conception is that there was Satyajit Ray, a great director</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of art movies like Pathar Panchali, and there is Indian popular</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cinema, which has absurd characters running round trees and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">singing of love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best, however, do not. Besides outstanding directors like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ray and his fellow Bengali, Ritwik Ghatak, throughout the history</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the Indian cinema there have been directors like Guru Dutt and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VS Shantaram, who have manipulated the commercial clich's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">differently, genuinely great stars to compare with those of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollywood, and playback singers and musicians, often classically</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trained, of real genius.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Hollywood, the golden age of Bollywood was during the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forties and Fifties. Now, however, a &quot;fusion&quot; is taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indian films with themes stolen from Hollywood are being made, in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an attempt to attract the new middle classes, who admire the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The music and song seem stranded in a limbo between Indian and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't necessarily a sad decline. It means that Indian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">movies are becoming technically more proficient and accurately</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reflect a rapidly changing and confused society, attracted to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West but determined to keep much of its own culture intact. A</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consequence of this is that, occasionally, a film comes along</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that, in attempting to break down barriers, offends officialdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such film was Shakur Kapur's The Bandit Queen, the story of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phoolan Devi, the most famous of Indian women outlaws. It dared to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">show the multiple rape she suffered at the hands of villagers who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resented her power, contained no songs and drove a coach and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">horses through the clich's of the bandit genre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After its success at Cannes, where it was bought for screening</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all over the world, the film was released in India to considerable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">acclaim. But not before there was a huge outcry, at first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">orchestrated by Devi herself, an influential political figure who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wanted her past forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there is another test case. Mira Nair's Kama Sutra, with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">screenplay by South African Helena Kriel, was rejected by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recent Indian International Film Festival at Trivandrum in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">southern state of Kerala. It was cut by the Indian censor- board</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and further shortened by India's supreme court, to which Nair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appealed. Scenes in which bare breasts and buttocks are seen must</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be reduced to seconds of screen time, and there can be no frontal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nudity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nair, who made Salaam Bombay, another great success at Cannes,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and then went to Hollywood to make Mississippi Masala, has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">directed a film based on the ancient classic stories, and claims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the intellectual community in Bombay and Delhi, where she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lives, have given the movie a &quot;heart-warming&quot; response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My film,&quot; she says, &quot;is to do more with sexual politics than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with sexual positions.&quot; But it's a title that comes with a lot of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">baggage. &quot;Television is full of foreign imports. And dozens of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">times you will see men and women dancing as if they were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">copulating. But we in India are brilliant at fixing things, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">how we fix sex is by cloaking it in song, dance and violence. Look</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the rape scenes in so many Indian commercial pictures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women are still supposed to be either virgins, good wives and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mothers, or whores. But they feel empowered by the film. It's the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">men who feel threatened.&quot; Another film, shown at the Trivandrum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Festival, though it almost caused a riot, was Deepa Mehta's Fire,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in which two married women become attracted to each other, largely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because of their boring husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no lesbians in India,&quot; wrote one journalist. &quot;Such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">things are merely a corruption of the West.&quot; Mehta, who lives in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada but made the film in India, otherwise got a good reception,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">though assailed by questions about her own sexuality by an avid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before Christmas, 15 superstars had their offices raided, as did</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THEATRE: Sifiso Maseko</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SALAELO MAREDI, resident director at the Market Theatre for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1997, says: &quot;I hope to make the Market more accessible to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">traditionally isolated persons. If I have my way, it will become</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">like a home to these people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His first production at the Market, Blackage, was inspired by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an article on corruption in the pension system. He has created a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">piece that protests against ill treatment of the elderly. A</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">humorous courtroom drama with the odd song and dance routine,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackage is there to stimulate debate, reflection - and provide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">entertainment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cast of 10, which includes Don Eric Mlangeni, Baby Cele and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arthur Molepe were hand picked by Maredi. &quot;Most importantly they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all share the vision of a 'Peoples' theatre',&quot; says Maredi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Blackage this vision gives voice to the treatment of senior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">citizens in the hands of unscrupulous state institutions. And</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">again Maredi reacts against the belief that a woman's place is in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the kitchen. How better to counter that view than to have an AK47-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">toting woman judge or doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essential to this new black age is tolerance. Though some ideas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the play counter traditional African conventions, they do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mark a loss of &quot;Africanness&quot;, but rather an affirmation of it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - @ FINE ART:Hazel Friedman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAST year's Unplugged exhibition will go down in South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">art history as a supreme example of the &quot;buddy system&quot; at its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">worst. Initiated by artist Kendell Geers as a riposte to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">traditional curatorial process - whereby the curator determines</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the content and presentation of an exhibition - Unplugged set</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">itself up as a transparent, democratic event with artists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">determining process and product via a nomination system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the chain letter principle got hopelessly lost in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">delivery. Unplugged II is a different beast, in part. Co-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ordinated by artist Malcolm Payne - who was last year chosen by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geers, (who was this year chosen by Payne), it has not attached</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">itself to a singular thematic peg. And like its precursor it has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not relied on curatorial intervention (which would have defeated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the aim of the exhibition). But unlike the artistic incest and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conceptual befuddlement that characterised much of the work on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last year's show, this exhibition has spread itself wider - in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">geographical sense, anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couplings are also not as predictable as in the previous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exhibition. For example, Minette Vari selected Siemon Allen from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban, who in turn chose fellow-Durbanite Aliza Levi. The fact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that Allen and Levi, along with Claudette Schreuders from Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town (chosen by the Cape's Lisa Brice), are regarded as three of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the names to watch on the contemporary art scene, perhaps means</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that future Unpluggeds will not remain confined within the cushy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ambit of Gauteng's traditional art cliquedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But breadth should not be confused with depth. In her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exploration of bodies prostrated in indeterminate spaces, Levi,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for example, displays little more than the degree to which she can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">integrate the styles of Jane Alexander and sculptor Wilma Cruise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she does this without the former's metaphoric richness and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gritty realism and the latter's monumentalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schreuders's Barbie and Ken sculptures easily achieve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;endearing&quot; status. Full of trendy tattoos, they are the 1990s</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mannequins for someone's mantelpiece. But that's about it. As for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peet Pienaar's contribution - a pair of found (as in bought) shoes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- it is irrefutably quaint and whimsical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Jeremy Wafer's quirky venture into the realm of op</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">art is both visually enticing and intellectually charged. A</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">triptych of glass paintings resembling black seed pods, or black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">holes, his work is at once archetypal and iconic; heraldic and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">metamorphic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willem Boshoff has also produced a compelling if slightly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cumbersome work. An epitaph of sorts to apartheid, it is called</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shredded Evidence and consists of a concrete poetry sculpture in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block form. Papered with 48 &quot;scrapped&quot; laws of apartheid - 1948</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was the year the National Party assumed power - it serves as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">monolithic monument to the attempted erasure of crimes committed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">under the guise of legality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Brand's equally monumental Do Earthlings Not Embrace Love</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provides a poignant indictment of war. It consists of three</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">figures of children constructed from metal and chipboard,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">haphazardly hung as though thrown into the air during an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">explosion. Initially their de- individualised, severed torsoes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could resemble uneven slabs of meat. Except for the fact that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brand has treated them as enlarged photocopies, photographs or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">freeze-framed documentary images. Up close, the forms are made up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of magnified dots, like photographic pixels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A semblance of coherence crumbles and details within the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seemingly amorphous mass are differentiated only by shadings of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">red to denote blood, and black for facial features. It is only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from a distance that their tragic humaness can be deciphered. And</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">most accusatory of all, perhaps, the forms have been bolted to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chipboard by screws bearing the name Denel - the company that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manufactures military equipment. Brand depicts the horror of war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and its victims without vulgar sensationalism, shock or schlock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tactics, but rather with an overwhelming sense of humanism and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">respect for his subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coincidentally, Geers has focused on a similar theme: violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and its relationship to art. But with a vastly different agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Called TW (title withheld) Rock (a throwback to the surrealist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">artist Magritte's Floating Rock) his work consists of a news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">insert detailing one of the most shameful episodes in the anti-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apartheid struggle: the necklacing of Maki Skosana in July 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was perpetrated by a frenzied mob in front of an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international audience and the footage was broadcast, at length,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on SABC as a propaganda triumph by the authorities at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geers has used the visual footage with a voice-track of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magritte talking about the ways in which two incongruous images</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">must find a way of reconciling. It's on sale for R1-million and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geers has offered the proceeds to the Truth and Reconcilation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geers has merely appropriated and decontextualised the brutal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sequence from its own history and directly transplanted it on to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">art, which in turn has been dislocated from its own history and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transposed on to life. The work offers no additional insights. Its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">role is little more than propagandist, echoing the truism that art</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is art and life is life. This, sadly, is art at its most soulless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the issue of appropriation, while white artists clearly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have no qualms about including what is essentially the history of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black South Africans in their work, they have not extended a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">similar courtesy to even one of the black contemporary artists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">working in South Africa to participate in this show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unplugged II will be more fondly remembered than its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">predecessor. But it might also be recalled as yet another example</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of artistic whitewashing with Made in the Old RSA stamped all over</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unplugged II is at the Rembrandt van Rijn Gallery in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg until March 15</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Catalyst Films is becoming the busiest and most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">respected production house in South Africa. ANDREW WORSDALE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN early 1986 Jeremy Nathan was doing his military service with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the film unit of the Entertainment Corp - a virtual propaganda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wing for the South African Defence Force. At night, though, he'd</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hang out with friends Matthew Krouse and Giulio Biccari,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">formulating De Voortrekkers, the subversive black and white short</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">film that took a Reichian view of South Africa's pioneer history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film incited near riots by right- wingers at the Limits of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberty Film Festival and was an insert in my own low- budget</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feature Shot Down - the first film Nathan produced (he even</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">managed to wangle his last month in the service off, to begin pre-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">production on the movie!).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a little over 10 years later and he has a pack of pictures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">behind him and is the head of a mini-empire of movie-making:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catalyst Films, one of the busiest production companies around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year it's producing nine short films ranging in length from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 minutes to half -an-hour; co-producing a feature; producing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more than six documentaries and has loads of projects in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After producing Shot Down, Nathan acted as the line producer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for Cedric Sundstrom's sleazy psycho-sexual thriller The Shadowed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mind, a film financed by tax-breaks that was largely written on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">set. It received some praise from cultists and after being banned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disappeared without a trace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that was 1988 and it was the end of the industry's free</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ride on the Receiver of Revenue. Nathan, an inveterate cinephile,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">moved on to developing several other local feature films. His</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plans ran aground due to lack of finance so he joined Afravision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(otherwise known as VNS) as a producer and made about 10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">documentaries, including the ANC history series Ulibambe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lingashoni (Hold up the Sun), and produced the controversial TV</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">series The Line, a production co-financed by ZDF and Channel Four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This project started his fruitful relationship with the United</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kingdom broadcaster and specifically its head of drama, David</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aukin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With South Africa's democratisation, VNS disbanded. &quot;Everyone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wanted to go in different directions and that's when I set up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catalyst,&quot; Nathan says. Operating alone and out of his flat in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troyeville, he managed to get several projects into development;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including the tale of Saartje Baartman, The Hottentot Venus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, instead of a two-roomed flat pungent with cat pee, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">company has offices, several computers, a switchboard and a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collection of people who help run the show. There's Nathan, Ethel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams-Abrahamse, Brenda Goldblatt and ex-stockbroker Ian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possibly the company's most exciting venture to date has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the co-production with Channel Four and Indra De Lanerolle's Xenos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Films of British director Les Blair's feature film Jump the Gun,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an improvisatory take on life in Jo'burg. The film recently played</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to a mixed-reception at the Berlin Film Festival. It's due for a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nationwide release of 20 prints and will play from inner-city</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cinemas to suburban mall arthouses later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even more enticing is Africa Dreaming, the six-part series</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of half-hour love stories that debuts on SABC1 in July this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea for the series came to Nathan and Zimbabwe-based producer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joel Phiri at the Rotterdam Film Festival in 1994. &quot;We just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thought: 'What can we do with all the producers we know in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rest of Africa?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result comprises The Last Picture from Zimbabwe, So Be It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from Senegal, The Black and the White from Tunisia, Mamlambo from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, The Gaze of the Stars from Mozambique and The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homecoming from Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madala Mphahlele of the SABC went for the project and put in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some development money then, with the help of the South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress of Directors (SACOD) and other industry players,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">workshops were held with screenwriter and teacher Jacques Akchoti</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where all the scripts were brainstormed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The SABC was the first to put its cock on the block,&quot; says</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participants that came in to back the $900 000 for the three hours</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of finished product. With production starting in October 1995 and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finished by March 1996, the speed is nothing short of amazing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R10-million in subsidies to the film industry, he has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">criticised in some quarters as &quot;getting to big for his boots&quot; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">acting like a Hollywood mogul. But it appears that's sour grapes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His partner, Ian Michler, says: &quot;Well that kind of jealousy just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">speaks for itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's success is in no small part due to Nathan. At the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town Film Market late last year Krystof Jorg, a commissioning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editor for ARTE, said to me: &quot;If anyone in Europe wants to do a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">film in South Africa, Jeremy is the first person they'll call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he's been to Europe, he's done the slog and he's proved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">himself.&quot; Enough said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial feedback on the series has been positive, people who've</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seen previews say that the different approaches of film- makers</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nathan says: &quot;When I left documentaries I went back to doing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">short films and that's what we're encouraging because we're trying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to create a cinema of emerging film-makers. Short films prove we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can tell stories, and stories are what it's all about.&quot; At a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recent conference in Harare he was quoted as saying that finance</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - A YOUNG playwright from Edenvale is currently earning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interest in the West End of London, Britain's theatreland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backpay, by 24-year-old Tamantha Hammerschlag, is being staged at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the illustrious Royal Court theatre, known for its pioneering of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">young talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hammerschlag is clearly delighted at having her work staged at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Royal Court. &quot;There is a really good feeling you get from</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">working there. The people at the venue have been very supportive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of me and my work,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backpay is set in contemporary South Africa and follows Mina, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white teenager, as she goes in search of Sophie, the black nanny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who looked after her when she was a small child. Through the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">characters, played by Britons, it charts the tensions raised in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the post-apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never had a figure like Sophie when I was growing up,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">someone who raised me, in the same way that Sophie did Mina,&quot; says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamantha. &quot;But we did have black maids. A lot of the play comes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from observation, as opposed to biographical experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She went to the Wits university and it was here that she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">started writing for the theatre. &quot;I always had my head in a book</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a child,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I have wide tastes. The things I wrote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at university were performed by the theatre groups there, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nothing professional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backpay is her first &quot;proper&quot; play and was written when she was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spending a year studying for her master of arts in drama in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London. &quot;All in all, it took about three months of serious writing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to finish it,&quot; she says. &quot;But obviously there were rewrites when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we started rehearsing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamantha received a favourable response within two months from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Court, the only venue she sent her completed piece to. &quot;My</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lecturer at college suggested the Royal Court and it paid off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dominic Tickell, who runs the Royal Court's Young People's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theatre, was impressed by Backpay when he read it. &quot;The play was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mature and courageous. She was not afraid for her characters to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a state of flux and for their circumstances to change,&quot; he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tickell reckons Hammerschlag has a bright future. &quot;I think she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is more promising than a lot of young playwrights we come into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contact with. She is serious about her work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The play was first seen as part of the theatre's Young</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Playwrights Festival last year and was revived for its West End</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">run, before going on to tour venues in the east of England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, Hammerschlag would like Backpay to be staged in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa. &quot;I've had preliminary talks but nothing concrete</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">yet,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is currently working on her second play but is reluctant to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discuss it. &quot;It is set in South Africa again. There have been so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many changes over the past few years that you can't help but be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">affected by what has gone on.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Exactly how much fuss can one naked man in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">jeans ad cause? Plenty, reports MARIA McCLOY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO adverts for Sissy Boy Jeans in the March editions of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosmopolitan and Elle magazines have resulted in a widespread</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media furore and caused several leading local chain stores to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remove the magazines from their shelves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What, can you see dick?&quot; asked one person when I mentioned the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">saga. Yes, the black and silver ad for Sissy Boy in Elle does</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feature a naked man - and yes, you can &quot;see dick&quot;, which has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">offended Checkers, Woolworths, OK and Pick 'n Pay. This, and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kama Sutra graphics in the Cosmo ad. Several of the stores said</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they had received customer complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad in Elle is a three-page spread paper - the one page is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">folded over and has a disclaimer in the corner warning: &quot;Do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turn this page if you find explicit material offensive.&quot; The sales</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">line reads: &quot;In South Africa there are over 30 men's magazines,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowing males to pore over sexually explicit pictures of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">females.&quot; Open the page and you see the naked model Philip</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McDonald, and the slogan: &quot;Well, two can play at that game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shona Bagley, Elle editor, believes it's each shop's right to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remove the magazines, &quot;but I'd prefer it if they gave their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">purchasers freedom of choice&quot;. She's disappointed by the shops'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">actions as she's had only three complaints among &quot;dozens&quot; of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">compliments from people who have said it was about time such an ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bagley had thought South African attitudes had evolved beyond</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this and says she accepted the ad because: &quot;Elle has a worldly,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enlightened readership that I believed would accept the ad in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spirit in which it was intended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have argued that the ads are not fit for children to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bagley stresses there was a disclaimer and a plastic band around</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the cover. &quot;Is it not time for a bit of gender quid pro quo? What</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">makes a naked female model more socially acceptable than her naked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">male counterpart? Who are the gatekeepers of supermarkets and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chainstores protecting here - women, children or male</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">vulnerabilities?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry Brewis, marketing executive at Woolworths, was one of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chainstore folk who describes theirs as a &quot;family store&quot;. He says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woolworths had received a number of public complaints. Cobie van</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dort, OK group promotions manager, says that pictures of people in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sexual positions would be seen by customers as &quot;objectionable&quot;. OK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is also planning to remove Directions magazine from its shelves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because of a feature on body- piercing showing a picture of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pierced penis - but, as a number of people pointed out, this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">picture hasn't caused nearly as much of a furore as the unviolated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">item.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Art director for the ad was Jupiter Drawing Room's Joanne</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas and copywriter was Noel Cottrel. Thomas says the campaigns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are intended to be tongue-in-cheek and depict women of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nineties &quot;as in control of what ever situation they may find</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">themselves in&quot;. She says the people who refused to stock the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">magazines are &quot;closed- minded&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jupiter Drawing Room MD Kevan Aspoas says he is thrilled with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the impact the ad has made. He dismissed the notion that the ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are pornographic, saying the model didn't have an erection and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the beautifully done ads are &quot;tastefully executed&quot;. He said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">calling these ads porn was akin to calling naked Roman statues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">porn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week The Star ran a story on the incident on its front</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">page, along with the naked picture. By the time the late edition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had come out the picture was gone. In an article the next day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editor Peter Sullivan said: &quot;The reaction it provoked suggested</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the decision to use it on the front page was inappropriate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and we bowed to public indignation by pulling the picture from our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">later editions ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like everyone involved in the campaign, Cosmopolitan editor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vanessa Raphaely was surprised by reactions to the ad. She says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">she's had both positive and negative feedback and that &quot;the last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thing we wanted was to offend people&quot;. She adds that the Kama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sutra has been a cultural icon for hundreds of years and is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">readily available in bookstores - and pointed out the irony that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this document was written by celibate monks. Though she did not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">personally see it as pornographic, &quot;I have to accept that what I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">think is not necessarily what other people think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year Cosmo ran a feature of naked male celebrities - but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their penises were covered - and she felt it would be hypocritical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to allow the nude ad to run when in that instance she'd not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowed full frontal naked males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johanna Pestana of The Advertising Standards Authority says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they've not received complaints about the naked man, but have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">registered seven written complaints about the Kama Sutra ad. And</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there have been people calling in with concerns that children are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being exposed and that the ad was insensitive to rape victims and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could spur potential rapists. There has to be a fair proportion of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">complaints (25% of readership) to have an agency withdraw a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">campaign. In terms of the letters written they've asked the ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agency to respond to the accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person who definitely doesn't agree that the ads are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">harmful or pornographic is the naked model. McDonald says:, &quot;I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">don't see why society should be embarrassed by a naked body.&quot; He's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had an &quot;extremely good&quot; reaction to the work, besides he wasn't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concerned by what reaction he'd get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He describes the concept as excellent, and has strong opinions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on a moralistic, closed-minded society, commenting that if it were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a naked woman there wouldn't have been a hullabaloo - in a sense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proving the ad's point. &quot;It'd be 'wow, check the chick out ... '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men would have been 100% happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what about the argument that the ad harms kids? Thomas says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the ad was done in such a way that if a child was to see it, it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would be no different to seeing their father or brother naked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, adds McDonald, people's attitudes have been borne out by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the dogma pumped into children that sex is bad and naughty - which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he thinks is what ends up giving people complexes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of Expression Institute chief Raymond Louw says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">retailers have the right to take such action when they think their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">customers may be offended, but adds that the reaction has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unsophisticated because of the bans and puritanical approach to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">art and pictures imposed by NP rule. &quot;People are too easily</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shocked by what could be regarded as reasonably normal elsewhere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every time they see a naked person they collapse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Notes from the Net</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOW is it that one of the smallest major newspapers in South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, namely the Mail &amp; Guardian, can boast the most popular</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">online publication on the African continent?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question comes with the release of audited figures that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">show more than 100 000 distinct visits to the site, and almost 300</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">000 distinct page requests. It is wonderful vindication of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">belief that the Web is a level playing field, where the size of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the site owner has no bearing on the success of a site. Right now,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the minnow in the print pond is the giant in the Web world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How exactly do Web sites measure their reader &quot;traffic&quot;? This</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">raises the ancient dilemma of statistics, damned statistics and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lies. That chestnut perfectly describes the world of Web hit-rate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there's not much that can be done about separating the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">damned from the clean statistic. But outright lies are a different</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">matter. Let me elaborate for a moment: let us say a Web site</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">records a million file requests in one month; that is the number</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of files, including both text and graphics (with every icon and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">button on every Web page counted as a hit), that has been called</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up over a month. This is &quot;statistics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It then tells all the world that it has had a million &quot;hits&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is &quot;damned statistics&quot;, since perhaps 90% of those &quot;hits&quot; are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">made up of extraneous material rather than distinct pages called</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up. Not a lie, but not a very clean figure either. And finally,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the claimant blurs the definitions, and gives the impression of &quot;a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million visitors to our site&quot;. That is plain old &quot;lies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's not much one can do about plain vanilla statistics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being used selectively enough to reveal only good or bad news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about the opposition. But a very powerful antidote has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">created for those &quot;damned statistics&quot; and &quot;lies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mainstream auditing firms have introduced Web auditing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">divisions to provide a formal measure of major sites' true usage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much like the All Media Product Survey forced newspapers to come</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">clean after 60 years of exaggerated readership claims, the Web</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">audit will force a level of honesty on Web site owners. Already,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(http://www.dtt.co.za/) Deloitte &amp; Touche is auditing the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electronic Mail &amp; Guardian (http://www.mg.co.za/mg), Business Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online (http://www.bday.co.za) and Business Times (http://www.bti</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mes.co.za) and is negotiating with The Independent Online</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(http://www.inc.co.za/).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coopers &amp; Lybrand (http://www.coopers.co.za/) is auditing Kevin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davie's Woza Internet (http://www.woza.co.za/) business news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">service. Of these, however, only the eM&amp;G and Woza have openly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">published audited Web figures, with the eM&amp;G reporting more than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">250 000 page requests in November, rising to the 300 000 mark in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January; while Woza, a more specialised and relatively new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">service, measured 38 000 distinct page requests in January. What</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is the crucial next step that Web auditing will force on the media</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seven new radio licences announced this week are set to breathe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">life and diversity into the airwaves. Allowing for specialist and</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to that over-tired parade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three FM stations in Gauteng went to Classic FM (classical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">music and jazz), Youth FM (black youth music station, 25% talk)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Khaya FM (formerly called Jozi Radio and aimed at the black</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Afrikaans talk station, Punt Op Mediumgolf, won MW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frequencies in Gauteng and Cape Town. Cape Talk (an English talk</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adult contemporary jazz station, got the mother city's FM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frequency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specific frequencies for each station are yet to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">determined, &quot;no later than the end of May&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Classic FM's ownership structure includes Disability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Empowerment Concerns with 10%; while Streetwise Children have 10%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Khaya FM. Radio P4 is 80% owned by Makana Trust, a consortium</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Argus 'mea culpa'Three former editors have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distanced themselves from the submission by Independent Newspapers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the truth commission, reports Jacquie Golding-Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EX-EDITORS of the former Argus Company, the new management at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Newspapers and journalists are involved in a heated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">debate regarding the Independent group's submission to the Truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an extraordinary move, three former Argus group editors have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distanced themselves from the report and challenged its contents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to The Sunday Independent they said they had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nothing to apologise for. In response, Cape Times editor Moegsien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams wrote a heart-rending open letter to John O'Malley, one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the three editors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Malley was the editor of the Daily News (1968-1977) and Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argus (1977-1982). The others were former Daily News (1977-1992)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Sunday Tribune editor-in-chief (1989- 1992) Michael Greene;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Sunday Tribune editor (1974-1989) Ian Wyllie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams notes &quot;with joy and disappointment&quot; the tack taken by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the editors, but goes on to relay a personal view of exactly how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it felt to be a black reporter in a white newsroom with a white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editor. &quot;A common feature we had to contend with as black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists was we were not fully trusted with the facts&quot;, says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams, recounting how badly one of his eye-witness account</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stories was handled by O'Malley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams expresses disappointment that the editors are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rejecting the &quot;humble apology&quot; offered by the Independent group,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and highlights many scenarios, including the fact that the truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seen through black eyes was often distorted to fit white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">perceptions and assuage the repressive government of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Malley argues that an apology is unnecessary: &quot;Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspapers, a foreign company, went ahead and made a submission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">without consulting us as editors during the era in question. It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was inappropriate for them to make a submission on our behalf,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially as we have nothing to apologise for,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former editor-in-chief of The Star (1974- 1990) Harvey Tyson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agrees. Interviewed on a non-attributable basis in the submission,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tyson says he chose not to associate himself with a company report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as he has &quot;absolutely nothing&quot; to apologise for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I am asked by the TRC to make a submission, I will be happy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to do so but what on earth do I have to apologise for? We should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be proud of what we achieved as the English press. We were the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">most consistent in our campaign against apartheid,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green argues that it is common knowledge that human rights were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">violated, but says the rights of the newspaper and its managers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were also violated with privacy being invaded via phone taps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last chair of the Argus Company (1990- 1994) before the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent's takeover, Doug Band, argues that the Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group should have embarked on a more &quot;thorough consultative&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">process before making the submission. However, Band says he is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposed to a case being presented to the TRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Cape Times (1971-1987) editor Tony Heard says the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">submission was a welcome step in the ongoing probe into the role</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of newspapers in a terrible era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although not consulted, Heard argues that the English press had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">failings and was more like a &quot;lightweight boxer&quot; who managed a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">couple of blows but nothing heavyweight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to most of the other editors, Heard more readily</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">admits that there were failings, adding that there should be a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;greater readiness by former editors to recognise that they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operated in a context of compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is time for a bit of humility and an apology especially</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when we all operated in a climate that neglected black reporters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and women staffers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some of the former reporters at the Argus group accept</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the actions of white editors may have been well- intentioned,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some feel that more could have been done to not only advance black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editorial staff but in terms of support from management for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">truth to be told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rafiq Rohan, formerly a political reporter in the Argus group,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disagrees with the contents of the letter published in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argues that at a time when he needed the support of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argus group, following his release from Robben Island, where he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had been sentenced to for 15 years for terrorism, &quot;my company put</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">me back on trial as they decided on my future within the group&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'WE believe Afrikaner/ Boere reporters should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stand together. We all have a common goal of self-determination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and as the media we can disseminate our information to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaner people and exert a great influence,&quot; says Henk van der</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graaf, chair of Die Mediaklub - the group officially formed about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two weeks ago in reaction, it appears, to the Black Journalists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forum (BJF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf denies this. &quot;It certainly was not in reaction,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he says, speaking in Afrikaans from the offices of Die Patriot,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the tabloid newsletter he edits and which is based at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative Party premises.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Die Mediaklub is a social club for reporters with the same</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goal of preserving the Afrikaans language and the heritage of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaner people,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flanked by a colleague from Radio Pretoria, Annemarie Joubert,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf explains the need for a club exclusively for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaner reporters. &quot;It is important that you unite people with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">common goals rather than diluting the strength of any group by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">having people of different cultures under one organisation. It is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">important that Boere journalists stand together and preserve what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is theirs and make sure no one encroaches on their culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf's office is slightly cramped. There is a poster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Paul Kruger lying on top of a filing cabinet; a Vierkleur flag</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of an old Boer republic on his desk and several framed black and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white photographs of Boere &quot;heroes&quot; on the wall. There is a plaque</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which reads: &quot;Onthou jul afkoms. Wees getrou! (Remember your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heritage. Be true to it.)&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf and Joubert complement each other. While she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">talks of the need to preserve and nurture the Afrikaans language,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he talks of the importance of having this &quot;precious language</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">polished for the youth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want an academy specifically for Afrikaans journalists in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the long term. The reasons for an academy are that it will allow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaans journalists to be trained in an environment in which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they feel comfortable and they will be taught by people who share</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the same political views making communication easier,&quot; says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joubert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf agrees - Die Mediaklub is definitely a long-term</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group as the Afrikaans language and its people are under threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argues that if it is acceptable to have a BJF, then it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should be acceptable to have an exclusively white journalists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group. &quot;They (BJF) are being racist by calling themselves black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not racist. We are just protecting ourselves because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policies like affirmative action threaten us,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joubert concurs: &quot;Our Mediaklub is not just a social event,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">although socialising plays an important part. It is to discuss</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">issues which directly affect Afrikaner journalists. For example,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all the press releases we receive are in English and it takes a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">long time to translate them into Afrikaans. We envisage a process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where we will unite, pull together all our resources and improve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the quality of our journalism by helping each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says the group currently meeting under the banner of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Die Mediaklub is small. Van der Graaf argues that numbers are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unimportant. &quot;It is not our numbers but our right-wing beliefs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that make us strong. We want to improve the lot of Afrikaans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists, but at the same time we want to improve the lot of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Afrikaner volk (people) as a whole,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf says the idea for a press club was initiated last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">October, but often the meetings degenerated into drinking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sessions. Thus, although socialising is still top of the list, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">monthly meetings are split into two sessions. First there is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lecture by an invited guest or a general discussion is held,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">followed by &quot;mingling&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf explains that Die Mediaklub has two sets of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">members. The first are bona fide journalists, while the second</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group are people involved in the media such as public relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admits that most of Die Mediaklub's members are from small</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">publications, mostly conservative newsletters or community radio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stations. None of the Afrikaans mainstream reporters have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recruited but &quot;we have an open invitation to all the media&quot;, he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf cautions that anyone, provided they are white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the same aspirations of rescuing the volk from being</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">swallowed up by blacks, can join.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all want to reach our ultimate goal of white Afrikanerdom,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">just like the BJF is forming a group to reach their specific</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goals,&quot; he says, adding that his organisation is linked to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all-white Mynwerkers Unie, among others. Why? Because they have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">common goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he says, it would be &quot;suicidal&quot; to link up with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political party as Die Mediaklub's members come from various</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">backgrounds, albeit most of them are ultra- conservative.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Is there a place in the South African media for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">institutionalised ethnicity? Jacquie Golding-Duffy reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'WE are not anti-white, but pro-black,&quot; says Abbey Makoe, chair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the steering committee of the Black Journalists Forum (BJF) -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the lobby group recently launched and endorsed by Deputy President</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thabo Mbeki and SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum has provoked much debate, with some critics arguing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it has no place in a new South Africa where reconciliation should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be the order of the day. However, Makoe challenges this, arguing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that reconciliation can only take place when black journalists are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on an equal footing with their white colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is black? &quot;Black is everyone who is not white. Whites are</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans, but they are just not black Africans. Whether they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(whites) have any allegiance to Africa is another thing,&quot; he says,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">speaking from his simple office at Eaton House, Sandton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wall is covered with photographs of his daughter and close</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">friends, an autographed picture of Miss South Africa Peggy-Sue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khumalo and some prints of him reporting in the township. One</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wall-hanging reads: &quot;Be a visitor and not a spy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng editor of the weekly black magazine Drum, Makoe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">believes that the BJF is needed to unite black journalists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nationally. Based on a United States organisation - the National</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Association of Black Journalists, Makoe says strength lie in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim of the BJF is twofold:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* to act as a pressure group, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* to ensure training and development for black journalists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">striving to reach the same calibre of journalism as their white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The standard of everything from writing to the use of English</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has to be improved among black journalists. We have not had the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">privilege of enjoying a good education. All this must change and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we must train and empower one another,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makoe says white journalists, more often than not, deserve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their senior positions as they are fully qualified. But, he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cautions, it should not be forgotten that they acquired their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">education by inhumane means. &quot;While they were studying, police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were beating township youths. While they were studying, black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">youths were being imprisoned. While they were studying, blacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were being murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have what we are fighting for and we are still aspiring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to reap the fruits of education. We are not going to take anything</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from them. What we want to do is share in their education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On improving the education of black reporters, Makoe says the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BJF can assist in lobbying for overseas funds to ensure training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and improved multi-skilling for reporters in print and electronic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media. It has succeeded in getting a local banking institution to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agree to train black reporters in financial reporting. It is also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">close to clinching deals with overseas sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makoe argues that the BJF provides a platform for black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists to vocalise frustrations and difficulties. &quot;It is nice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to see my black brothers and sisters no longer being the minority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a bar full of white reporters. It is good to have the BJF where</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they have a voice and are allowed the opportunity to network with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">politicians and socialise with people in the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BJF has monthly imbizos and always has a guest speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makoe argues that the speakers talk off the record, allowing a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">degree of trust to be nurtured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are respected in the township, but once in the newsroom we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are merely told what to do by our white editors and are often</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">influenced by them. That all has to change and change it will ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the change happens we have to be fully equipped to do the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">job well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makoe says the future is either &quot;black or bleak&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If white corporations are committed to empowering black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists then it stands to reason that most of the upper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">echelons of companies will be black. If that does not happen and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it won't for many, many years, then racial polarisation will be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea for the BJF began as early as 1992 when a group of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black journalists informally gathered. &quot;We realised it was crucial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that we present ourselves as a monolithic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to be black and proud and not feel the need to emulate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white colleagues. We are not antagonistic and will not deny anyone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">admission to the BJF, but I do not see why a white journalist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would want to be a part of a group which is intent on training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black reporters. White reporters do not need the assistance we are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">planning to mete out to black journalists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BJF is planning to make a submission to the Truth and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reconciliation Commission and promises that it will be &quot;a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">revelation. It will not be deliberately evasive of the hardships</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">endured by black reporters, but it will recount personal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">experiences. It will also name spies which operated in the media -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a list which is long overdue,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the formation of Die Mediaklub, Makoe says he does not see</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the point of such a club other than it obstructing affirmative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">action and standing in the way of black development. &quot;I do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">object to it but they must be warned ... we are watching their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">every move.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stamp out the wildest risks taken by City of London derivative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">traders is expected to follow the $80-million scandal at NatWest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markets that this week helped to wipe nearly $900-million off the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stock market value of the banking group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Bellchambers, chief executive of the Futures and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Options Association (FOA), said the FOA was likely to consider</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proposals to provide better links between salaries and long-term</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">performance. It might issue new guidelines to improve the scrutiny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of dealing in complex financial instruments where failures have</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NatWest insisted the $80-million charge it will take against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first-half profits was a conservative provision for the losses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">incurred by the &quot;mis-pricing errors&quot; believed to have been booked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Kyriacos Papouis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young interest rate options trader, who had worked for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NatWest Markets for about two years in what was his first City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">job, left the banking group towards the end of last year and was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said to be &quot;on leave pending further information&quot; by his new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">employer, the United States securities house, Bear Stearns. There</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was no comment from Neil Dodgson, suspended for failing properly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to supervise Papouis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite intensive investigation over the weekend by teams of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forensic accountants, NatWest said it was likely to take weeks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before its inquiry into the mis-pricing scandal was complete,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">although a representative said it appeared unlikely that more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heads would roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, NatWest heightened its internal supervisory systems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in an attempt to head off similar debacles elsewhere in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FOA's move on remuneration is expected to be welcomed by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Bank of England, which this week issued a warning about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dangers of tempting City traders to take risks to achieve big</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bonuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City is looking too accident-prone for comfort as an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international financial centre. The hole in the accounts of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NatWest Markets is symptomatic of deeper concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A clear line can be drawn from the Barings collapse two years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ago to the absorption of SG Warburg into the Swiss Bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporation and the difficulties at Morgan Grenfell Asset</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these events can be traced to weaknesses inside City-based</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provides such huge incentives to successful traders that it pays</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them to cheat, and encourages internal supervisors to see no evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FOA's backing for a more rational bonus structure, while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">welcome, should have come much earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second problem is the investment priorities of City houses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deutsche Morgan Grenfell will think nothing of paying multi-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million transfer fees to get a good trader or fund manager, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will not consider applying similar sums to the compliance or risk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">assessment officers whose duty is to keep more adventurous traders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, there has been a woeful neglect in putting in place</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the processing systems to support the volume of trading in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">derivatives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC is in danger of losing sight of the real</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'struggle' - creating a more equal social order, writes Heribert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE African National Congress Deputy Minister of Trade and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry, Phumzile Mlambo-Nguka, recently said black businessmen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should not be shy to say they wanted to become &quot;filthy rich&quot;. Such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an attitude rings of crass materialism, implying the neglect of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the poor majority in the drive to self-enrichment by an elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testing the reactions of 50 black students and aspiring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business executives revealed four clusters of opinion. Endorsement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the controversial statement overshadowed all criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vulgarity of being &quot;filthy rich&quot; amid a sea of shanty towns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">notwithstanding, the desire concurs perfectly well with the logic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of capitalism. Why should blacks exempt themselves from behaviour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that rewarded white beneficiaries so handsomely in the past?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism of black fatcats, without including white fatcats,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">smacks of racism indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had an equal playing field been provided in the past, &quot;black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business people would probably have been stinking rich already&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only is such a success story overdue, rich blacks create jobs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and enlarge the narrow white tax base. Lamenting the rise of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black bourgeoisie perpetuates the stereotype that it is &quot;natural&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for blacks to be poor and whites to be affluent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To step outside one's customary status is never unproblematic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resentful surprise about black Africans in luxury cars and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fancy houses, albeit a tiny group, mixes sneering envy with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">condescending admiration among many less fortunate whites. The old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white capitalists, on the other hand, delight in parading their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">new-found allies in profiteering. The more black faces, the easier</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it is to reject charges of racial capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet legitimate concerns about &quot;filthy rich&quot; blacks persist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those uneasy worries can be broken down into moral, egalitarian-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">socialist and political objections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moral reservations focus on the ostentatious consumption of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">few while the many suffer in poverty. An African communitarian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cultural tradition is said to impose obligations on the better-off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to remember where they came from. Giving back to their fellows and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;brothers&quot; is seen as moral duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wealth of white counterparts has been achieved partly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through apartheid exploitation. By endorsing a similar black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">selfishness, a new elite merely continues what is seen as the same</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shameless greed by hook or crook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike socialism, which aims at levelling all wealth, the moral</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">criticism does not assail affluence per se, but focuses on how it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been acquired. The speed with which new black millionaires</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">emerge makes it unlikely that they have earned their fortune by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the sweat of their brows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, moral critics have a field day denouncing this as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unethical behaviour. Yet even those politics of embarrassment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prove ineffectual in a climate where &quot;filthy richness&quot; becomes an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unabashed goal in itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egalitarian-socialist objections point to similar concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encouragement of the filthy rich occurs at the expense of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weak. While a minority of opportunists enrich themselves, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">masses are sidelined and ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this principled position, President Nelson Mandela needs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to be applauded for rejecting outright the request by black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business (National African Chambers of Commerce) to have all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outstanding taxes before 1994 relinquished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the refusal to entertain special tax exemptions for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black business should not only have been justified by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confusion it would create in the tax- collection system, but by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the duty of the rich to finance the new order, regardless of past</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;taxation without representation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet such moralistic and egalitarian reasoning falls on deaf</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ears in a neo- liberal climate that celebrates individual success</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at all costs. Communal solidarity impedes the accumulation of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individual fortunes. A global market celebrates rootless and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ruthless profiteering that eschews civic connectedness and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">national sacrifices as old-fashioned virtues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political reservations about filthy richness stand on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strongest ground. Not only is it unwise for an ANC Cabinet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">minister to provoke its poor constituency with such inflammatory</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">language, the ANC encourages class warfare if it loses sight of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">destabilising inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC turns its back on a history of struggle that once aimed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at racial capitalism as its main target. During that distant past,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">activists romanticised the simple, modest life with survival wages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for unionists. Bourgeois lifestyles were denounced as those of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">class enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the most, Toyotas, not German luxury cars, were to be the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">signature of successful revolutionaries. Nowadays, according to an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">insider, some parliamentarians almost panic at the thought of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being overlooked for directorships and other private-sector</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appointments where the real power is seen to be located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When former activists turn into instant millionaires by what is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">called &quot;overdue career changes&quot;, they not only bury their own</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">history but confirm the triumph of non- racial capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, was the anti- apartheid struggle never more than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">getting a larger slice of the pie? Was it merely a materialistic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fight against racist exclusion from capitalist spoils rather than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">creating an alternative, more humane and equal social order?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was asked, &quot;What goes through your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mind when you fly over a squatter settlement?&quot; He answered rather</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">complacently: &quot;I think there is an enormous amount of patience</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">among the people in those shacks. I don't think there's any kind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of explosive sentiment in reaction to the perceived lack of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">delivery of houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Mbeki also realises that patience wears thin sooner or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">later. One would have expected him to stress government's highest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concern with speedy delivery. Instead, he focuses on the benign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">response of the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lines from Gillo Pontecorvo's classical film on the Algerian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">revolution, Battle of Algiers, read: &quot;It is difficult to start a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">revolution, more difficult to sustain it. But it's later, when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we've won, that the real difficulties will begin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not exactly a revolution, the ANC has achieved its major</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goal to ditch apartheid. It was liberation that held the broad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">church of the ANC together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of a new core ideology, the ANC is in danger of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">falling apart as manifold fissures emerge. What could substitute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for successful liberation as the common bond for different</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interests? Will black empowerment and enrichment fill the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ideological vacuum?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic growth and development seem to have emerged as the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goal behind which all factions should unite. However, the strategy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to achieve this is intensely contested as the debate about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">macro- economic policy, growth, employment and redistribution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Gear), indicates. It is a conflict over growth at whose cost, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the noble goal proves more divisive than unifying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redistribution and transformation have been other initial core</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ideas but they too have fallen by the wayside as too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controversial. Redistribution would happen mainly at the expense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of whites and is associated with discredited socialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redistribution through progressive taxes would create a hostile</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment climate. South Africans already feel overtaxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A one-time limited levy for equalisation has been almost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unanimously rejected by the old establishment. That only leaves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transformation in the minds and attitudes of people where no costs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are involved. Reconciliation and nation-building operate only in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the symbolic realm and fail to deliver material improvements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once uniquely inspiring vision of non- racialism has also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">faded away. Non- racialism has been undermined by racially based</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">affirmative action, an economically inexpensive and politically</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wise corrective for the legacy of legalised racism from a business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After decades of colour-consciousness, colour-blindness can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hardly be expected. Claims for entitlements and greater</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representativeness of the racially disadvantaged remain on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agenda of Africanists and populists. Racial integration at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">social level has so far been confined to a small elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even university students drift into the cultural comfort of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their own groups, with only superficial interaction across racial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what is left to inspire the heterogeneous ideologies and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interests of ANC members to be pursued in a single party?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black empowerment - a euphemism for more control by a small</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">privileged elite? Will patronage and personal enrichment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constitute the new glue for a fragmenting movement? Endorsing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;filthy richness&quot; seems the surest recipe for self-destruction of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a party in need of a new mission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - CRIME and unemployment grab the headlines, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an even greater obstacle to putting South Africa on the fast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">growth track is illiteracy. The fact that the National Economic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) put the issue high on its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agenda at its first meeting this year highlights the growing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concern that without education, all efforts to boost the economy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be stymied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nedlac constituencies committed themselves to finding a way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to fund industry-based training by the next council meeting on May</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The decision coincides with Adult Literacy Week, and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tabling in Cabinet of the Department of Labour's Green Paper on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">human resource development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that a quarter of the population can barely make out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the headline, let alone get as far as the first sentence of this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">article, is on the agenda again. The most recent literacy study</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">completed in 1995 showed that 10-million to 15-million South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans are functionally illiterate, in other words, they do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have the competencies of a standard seven school pupil. Between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seven and 10-million do not have the competencies of a standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">five pupil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Enrico Fourie, director of the National Literacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-operation (NLC) - an umbrella group for more than 150 non-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governmental organisations in the literacy field - functional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">illiteracy entails an inability to abstract information, draw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conclusions, or make the necessary associations in a given text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the statistical parameters are measured against an ideal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">definition of what standard seven or five competency should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">represent, the impact of the disrupted and historically unequal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African education system throws even these figures in doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that close on 15-million people simply cannot read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of functional illiteracy on the economy only becomes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obvious when, for example, you are stuck behind someone who takes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20 minutes at the automatic teller machine. Fourie explains:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the stigma attached to illiteracy, it is internalised,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially because of our society's hegemonic First World culture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">emphasising tertiary learning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, studies show that widespread dysfunctionality is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially concentrated in the 16-to-25 and 35-to-60 age groups -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">critical groupings whose reading problem is eating away at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">future growth and development of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to the problem is that the most radical programmes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undertaken by the government and institutions focus on employed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">workers, rather than the unemployed, who are the greatest victims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of illiteracy. Consequently, the programmes concentrate on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industry-based training rather than holistic educational</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">competency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wendy Dobson at Nedlac says the debate boils down to &quot;who pays,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">how much, and what is the money going to be used for? If there is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a payroll levy, is it applicable to companies that already pay a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lot on training?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national human resources policy envisaged by the Department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Labour will establish a national training fund. Currently,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">certain sectors such as the hospitality and metal and engineering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industries have formalised training funds that set training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standards and implement them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question then is whether there should be a single national</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">front or sectoral ones. Sectoral funds raise concerns that certain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">areas would slip through, while a national fund that would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">formalised and tripartite in nature could set appropriate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standards, decide on national needs and priorities, and then</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">support sectoral funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour supports the national fund concept and is also proposing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a 4% payroll levy. According to Dobson, business has a different</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">view. &quot;If they can avoid the levy they will. Where they are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">already spending a lot on training, which is the case in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">financial sector where the product is based on training, they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would want to negotiate a rebate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She adds that business believes a national fund would be too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bureaucratic and too distanced from sectoral needs, while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">encouraging the proliferation of government bodies and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, such a fund and body would not help the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unemployed or special interests, like the informal sector, which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">encompasses the bulk of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate in Nedlac reflects a positive reaction to the formal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sector's human resource issue, but the Presidential Lead Project</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to promote Adult Basic Education and Training (Abet) for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">majority of the population is floundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the Department of Education has created a line</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">function to deal with Abet, but has not provided a line function</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">budget item for it. As a result, R50- million was allocated as an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interim amount to the programme, and represents less than 1% of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the entire education budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulty of prioritising adult education is patently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obvious, but the pressing timeframes imposed by the growth,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">employment and redistribution (Gear) policy needs should throw a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">different light on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gear's success depends on building an economy capable of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">competing in the global market. A reasonably skilled workforce is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">central to this model - hence the concentration on human resource</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development. But the underlying South African literacy statistic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cannot support the vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourie argues that the impact of illiteracy is not only felt in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terms of the economy and human resources, it also threatens the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fledgling democracy in a far more serious way, because people are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">handicapped by lacking basic political skills, which further</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undermines the domestic and social environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the R50-million in education is being spent on a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project called Ithuteng - ready to learn. It focuses on 10 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adult learners per province, and is being conducted with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">parallel project funded by the European Union, and initiated by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the NLC - the &quot;thousand learner project&quot;. The aim is to test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standards, norms and values in terms of developing a basic Abet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">programme for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourie explains: &quot;We are trying to develop a localised system</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with which we can reach as many learners as possible with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">least possible resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next step is to develop key policy guidelines, which they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hope to formalise through legislation by 1998. At the moment,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">however, the statistics are bleak for new adult learners in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African system. According to EDU, an education statistics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agency, only 330 000 new learners have entered the system per year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abet vision outlines a system that can provide literacy at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a very low cost without compromising a general education standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system should be flexible and comply with particular community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">needs. The initial result of the pilot learner programmes shows</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that it can be done. But the lack of resources in education are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frustrating hopes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The example of the Gauteng province night- school system is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">illuminating. While the infrastructure is available, and gives the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">province an advantage, the system of adult education simply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reflects the formal education system. This is not what a fully</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fledged Abet programme would do; it should provide a base from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which adult learners could enter the job market, and would begin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to integrate with the national human resource programmes,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supplementing their functional approach and developing well-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rounded assets to society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of money and strategic planning is preventing the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development of such a system even where infrastructure exists. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lobby for a restitution fund would begin to address the question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point of the Adult Literacy Week marketing exercise is to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">emphasise that adult basic education is not only a problem for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education Department, it is a national crisis and should be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">planned for as such.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Sentiment has improved, but to capitalise on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turnaround, Trevor Manuel must define the strategy for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">implementing Gear, argues Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SO, Trevor Manuel will get to present his first Budget after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all, despite rumours of a Cabinet reshuffle earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already he has quietened his detractors by showing the deficit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">target is on track, albeit due to increased revenue collection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rather than expenditure cuts, but no matter. This finance minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is determined to stick to his guns - which leaves him with very</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">little room to manoeuvre next Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he is to live up to the expectations created by the growth,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy unveiled last June -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and specifically, the deficit projections - the 1997/98 Budget</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will confine itself to tinkering rather than large-scale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expenditure changes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the same token, the Katz Commission on taxation is not due</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to report until August, thus the revenue side is equally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constrained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party's Budget Proposals, presented this week,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">call for a rise in the rate of value added tax to 15%, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">analysts consider such a move unlikely in the face of fierce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposition from the labour movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, there is little scope to lower company taxes or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">compensate for bracket creep in personal income tax rates. Some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">changes to the secondary tax on companies and marketable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">securities tax are possible; the DP would like to see them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">abolished, along with donations tax and estate duty - at a cost to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fiscus of R1,8-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important than the nuts and bolts, however, is the overall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">structure. Says Nico Czypionka, chief economist at Standard Bank:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We realise the government has little room to manoeuvre in terms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of policy, but this has to be the year of implementation. What we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">want to see from the Budget are the details of how Gear will be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">set in motion. That is what the markets are waiting for - and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would give Manuel the opportunity to make a real impact on macro-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">economic policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, Manuel would do well to capitalise on the turnaround</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in sentiment witnessed in the past two months. The South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chamber of Business's confidence index was up again in February,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by 0,9 of a percentage point, thanks to the stronger rand, higher</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exports and soaring share prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, warns the chamber, the Budget needs to be convincing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Continued domestic and foreign confidence depends on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">performance of the Gear-directed economy.&quot; In this context,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sticking to the 4% deficit target for this financial year is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">paramount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important to the labour constituency than fiscal probity,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">however, is reprioritisation of expenditure. Says James Heintz of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the National Labour and Economic Development Institute (Naledi):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our biggest concern is how the money is spent. We would like to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">see a greater emphasis on development spending - health,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">education, welfare and housing must take priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He raises concerns about the lack of participation in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">budgetary process by the various stakeholders. &quot;In effect, we now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have 10 budgets rather than one, because each province gets to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allocate its resources independently of national priorities. We</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">need a co-ordinating institution to ensure that healthcare,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">welfare, education and housing are not sidelined by the provincial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivery is certainly top of everyone's agenda - and pivotal to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gear's success. And while the lower growth levels predicted for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this year will, to some extent, restrict the authorities' options,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the revised figures give no cause for alarm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, was at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pains to lift growth hopes this week, predicting an increase of 3%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for this year, against a consensus forecast among economists of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about 2,5% and a projected 2,9% set out in Gear.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foundation, which funds education projects for the under-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">privileged, Zenex Oil said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foundation was started by United States oil giant Esso when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it pulled out of South Africa in 1987 and set up Zenex Oil.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the foundation has been fed with all non- retained income from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zenex Oil's retail operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday Zenex announced it was negotiating with Worldwide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa Investments to sell its operation as a going concern. It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said the business would continue to operate under the Zenex name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zenex Oil managing director Paul Richards says the proceeds of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the sale will pass to the trust Esso set up to control both Zenex</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A joint-venture deal with Naledi Petroleum has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exposed Sasol's policy of taking over petrol stations ahead of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deregulation, writes Mungo Soggot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASOL has been quietly buying up prime petrol station sites in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng in anticipation of a relaxation of regulations that bar it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from retailing fuel, the synthetic fuel giant confirmed this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol communications manager Alfonso Niemand said Sasol Oil had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bought about 20 sites in the region which it had leased to other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">oil companies on a &quot;strictly commercial basis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol has previously not disclosed this strategy, which many of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its rivals in the crude oil industry had long suspected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol's buying spree in Gauteng was exposed this week after the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">announcement of a fuel retailing deal flagged as a &quot;black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">empowerment&quot; move. A consortium, led by Naledi Petroleum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investments and Sasol, has set up a new fuel retail company -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naledi Petroleum - in which Sasol has the minority 22,5% stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geoffery-Mabule Hlabangane, chair of Naledi Petroleum, said the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group would eventually develop a network of 60 retail outlets in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng. He said it would build four or five of its own, while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many of the rest would be bought and leased from Sasol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlabangane said Sasol owned several prime sites - including top</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engen &quot;one stops&quot; - that were leased to other oil companies. &quot;It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is a well-known fact,&quot; he said. Naledi would take over stations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when the leases had expired. Naledi, which had been poised to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strike a deal with Engen, was also talking to other fuel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol is barred from retailing by a contract with the oil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">companies that is a pivotal part of the sanctions era regulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governing the fuel industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other side to the contract is that the oil companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tolerate the government's hefty subsidy to Sasol's synthetic fuel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">division - the lynchpin of apartheid's &quot;total onslaught&quot; oil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policies. That subsidy will be phased out by 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But although the contract forbids Sasol from retailing, it does</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not forbid it from owning sites - providing a gap for Sasol to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">position itself in anticipation of deregulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indicated he is in favour of a phased deregulation of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol is the main supplier of fuel in Gauteng with its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">synthetic fuel plants and its Natref fuel refinery, which it owns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">jointly with Total SA, the local arm of the French oil company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Johannesburg press conference announcing the Naledi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deal, Sasol executives sat among the journalists while the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consortium's black bosses took centre stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol, once a Broederbond stronghold, has been itching to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participate in an empowerment deal since 1995 and even published a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statement two years ago that it was negotiating with a black-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controlled fuel company. It provided no names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlabangane told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the new company had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">secured a R50-million loan from the Amalgamated Banks of South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, much of which would be used to buy from Sasol several</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supply contracts - deals to provide fuel to individual businesses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or, for example, army installations. The rest would go towards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">building up its network of stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that within three years the group wanted 40 high-volume</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stations in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ownership of fuel stations is governed by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rationalisation Plan - the other pillar of the boycott-era</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">regulations. The Ratplan divides up the country's stations among</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the local representatives of the oil majors, which also enjoy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">guaranteed margins - the sweeteners offered to keep them here</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">during the sanctions era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of less profitable sites, oil companies are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reluctant to hand over valuable licences, in which case they are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distributed on a roster basis, so that all the big majors, as well</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as Sasol, take turns in supplying them. Sasol has about 20 of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these sites, many of which will be leased to Naledi Petroleum, in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">addition to its other sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlabangane confirmed that Naledi had yet to be incorporated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into the Ratplan - the only stumbling block to the deal. But he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was confident it would get the green light by the time Naledi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opened its doors in June. He said all that remained was for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Petroleum Industry Association (Sapia) to give its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plans the nod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sapia chairman Colin McLelland said the association was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">examining Naledi's proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naledi's consortium boasts the features of a typical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">empowerment deal. It includes the investment arms of two struggle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisations - the South African National Civics Organisation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Sanco) and the National Hostel Residents Association (Nahora).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also includes the influential National Black Retailers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Association, which has offices close to Sasol's Randburg base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanco and the hostel company were brought to the party by a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mysterious company called Powerlib, whose flamboyant boss, Eric</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Molefe, has been talking to Sasol for about two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside Sasol's efforts to forge ties with black business has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been its close relationship with the black taxi industry. At one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stage during negotiations at the National Economic Development and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour Council this relationship was exposed as being excessively</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">close: the taxi industry's statement on the controversial topic of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol's subsidy was identical to Sasol's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlabangane - the owner of two McDonald's outlets who has worked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at Mobil and then Engen - said he was unconcerned about Sasol's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">motives for the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlabangane insisted this was a genuine &quot;black empowerment&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deal, which would not merely enrich him and the other consortium</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heads as the investment arms of both Sanco and Nahora would feed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">back to millions of people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - What exactly is South Africa doing in its new,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">state-of-the-art Antarctic research base? Lesley Cowling reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PICTURES of Antarctica show a pristine wonderland: stunning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white snow and poster- blue seas, penguins in their zoot suits,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the wildest cleanest place on earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's also the coldest, windiest place on earth. In winter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there's no light, in summer there's no dark, and humans could not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">survive in this wasteland of ice and snow long without modern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its inhospitable nature has kept it pure. Now more and more</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nations have set up camp on the ice. They're there to do research,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they say, in the world's largest natural laboratory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to prove it, the nations with bases in Antarctica are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">signatories to a treaty that declares the continent a natural</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reserve devoted to peace and science. There is a prohibition on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mining in the area and rules for environmental protection of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continent have been established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's involvement in the Antarctic dates back to 1959,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when Norway decided to vacate its base in Queen Maud Land and give</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it to South Africa. South Africa also became one of the original</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">signatories to the Antarctic Treaty at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norway's base was built on an ice shelf and, as the years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">passed, it began to sink into the ice. So when the South Africans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">began planning a new base, they decided to site it on rock, 160km</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inland from the coast. An added bonus was the view: the old base</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">looked onto an expanse of snow and ice, but from the new base -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unromantically dubbed Sanae 4 - you can see a range of polar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new base looks from a distance like three linked train</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">carriages on a bridge, perched up on stilts. It cost more than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R30-million, and was specially designed for Antarctic conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rounded ends and smoothed shape decrease wind resistance and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the walls are made of fibreglass to increase insulation from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cold. The stilts allow snow to blow past the building instead of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collecting against it and burying it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this effort was to make life easier for the teams of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scientists, researchers and support staff that spend summer or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">winter periods there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Skinner, who co-ordinates the scientific projects in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antarctica, says the Department of Environmental Affairs and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourism, which is responsible for the Antarctic programme, does</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not conduct research itself. Instead, they make funds of between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R2-million and R3-million available for university or other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">institutions to conduct research there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application process is quite rigorous: research proposals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are vetted by international and local peers, then a national task</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group decides which projects should be supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A chosen few get to board the SAAgulhas in November and go to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antarctica for the few summer months, gathering things like rocks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or setting up equipment to collect more arcane data, before</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heading back to do the real analysis in university labs in more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">temperate climes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few very hardy souls do what's called &quot;overwintering&quot; -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">staying for the dark, freezing Antarctic winter. Four physicists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be doing that this year, working on the research projects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that have been designed for the dark months. At least one of these</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involves looking at the moving cloud of colours that are the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pole's equivalent of Northern lights, also known as the aurora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wintering team from Potchefstroom and Natal universities will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">also measure magnetic fields, radar, cosmic rays and radio waves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not just about science. Skinner says South Africa needs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a presence in Antarctica, because &quot;we need to remain party to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">future decisions about the continent&quot;. A number of states have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">laid territorial claims to Antarctica. South Africa is not one of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them. But that does not mean letting someone else camp in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">backyard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In a conversation with Benjamin Pogrund, Harry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oppenheimer reflects on his life in business and defends his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">companies' stance on apartheid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARRY OPPENHEIMER carries his 88 years lightly. &quot;I feel well</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and I enjoy life so I'm very lucky at my age,&quot; he says. He's a bit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stooped and says his hearing is not what it was, although there is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">no sign of difficulty during conversation. Walking is his chief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exercise. He reads a lot and enjoys biographies and Victorian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">novels, especially Trollope.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He comes to his office at Anglo American's headquarters at 44</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Main Street most days of the week but usually stays for only a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">short time: &quot;I read the papers, I talk to my friends and they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">treat me kindly, and they even ask my views from time to time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oppenheimer is upbeat about South Africa. He is &quot;immensely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pleased at what has taken place&quot; and praises Nelson Mandela &quot;who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is extraordinarily good in having prevented violence and promoting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goodwill&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also believes the government is &quot;making a serious effort&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and is &quot;doing quite well&quot; to build the economy - the answer to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">meeting the aspirations of the have-nots before their rage boils</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His praises are tempered by criticism of the government's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">performance. He also acknowledges that Anglo American Corporation,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of which he was chairman until his retirement at the end of 1982,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">did less than it could have done to buck apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His criticisms of the government are voiced as mildly and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">carefully as his praises: &quot;I don't think this government so far</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has shown enormous ability at national administration,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the other hand what could you expect? It could have been a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">great deal worse - and I'm not certain that it isn't just as good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as the last government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime is his greatest anxiety for the future. &quot;It results in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feeling of agitation in the country, it results in lots of people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leaving the country, and I think it's a major factor in preventing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the degree of foreign investment which we hope for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of us know people who have been hijacked or whose car has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been stolen, and they're very lucky if they haven't been shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is worried, too, about possible moves towards one-party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rule: &quot;I think there is a tendency, in the African way of looking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at things, not to scorn democracy, but to see democracy in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">different way. I wonder very much whether many of our masters in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the political field really think in terms of parties and an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposition party which one day will come into power and then in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turn lose power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not sure that they think like that, I hope that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">eventually they will. Some people do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has to be affirmative action, he says, but cautions that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;you've got to be jolly careful with it. I find certainly in this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">office that some of the black people - nowadays we have many more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in senior jobs than we used to - are not very keen on affirmative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is cautious, too, about South Africa's attempts to influence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the world. &quot;I know that we have prestige, which has largely again</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been given to us by Mandela, but I don't think we are a country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which can really change the world very easily outside our own</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">borders. I hope we can set an example for other countries which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have the same set of problems but I very much doubt that we can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">send troops about the place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says that his support for the Progressives in their various</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forms over the years continues through the Democratic Party: &quot;It's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the only party I really could support. Much as I admire the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Congress it's not for me, I don't feel it's my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">party. I can't imagine myself voting for the Nationalists: I am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">afraid their past is such that I really couldn't bring myself to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do that, certainly not in their present form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that the DP talks a lot of sense and I think Tony Leon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">talks a lot of sense. I do not know how far they will succeed, how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">far they will get people to vote for them and how far they can get</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black support, which is vital in South Africa as it is now, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nevertheless it's the only party that I feel really happy voting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking back at his life he believes his greatest contribution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is that he has been &quot;a reasonably successful businessman in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sense of carrying on in a sensible way from what my father built</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and doing it, naturally, in my own way, not in his, because you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can't try to be exactly the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that I've tried, though not always as successfully and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">energetically as I should, to run businesses in a way which really</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">did help to build a better sort of society and a better sort of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But did the many industrial, mining and commercial companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controlled or influenced by Anglo American do much to buck</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apartheid? They could, for example, have recognised trade unions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for blacks even if the law did not recognise them, and could have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">focused on training blacks and paying better salaries. On the gold</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mines, no one made full use of the government concession allowing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">married quarters for up to 3% of workers. If his companies had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taken a lead in these industrial and mining matters couldn't that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have profoundly influenced South Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is much in what you say,&quot; says Oppenheimer. &quot;I think we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">did some of these things. I agree that we didn't do as much as we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should have done. On the other hand, to take a defensive line</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about our group I think we can honestly say that in the major</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business organisations we were always in the lead. We were, if not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rushing along with the angels, we were following on to them, in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cautious way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About housing on the mines: we aimed at and had elaborate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">schemes for housing 10% (of the total labour force). We were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stopped from doing this by Dr Hendrik Verwoerd (minister of Native</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affairs and then prime minister) and I think it is fair to say,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and fair criticism, that having been stopped, we didn't go on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fighting as hard as we should have done. We tended to hide behind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fact that we were prevented from doing all that we wanted to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the political level he believes that he might have supported</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the notion of a qualified franchise - the policy pursued by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Progressives - for too long. But he does not regret that he did</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">support it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was Jefferson - I may have got the name wrong - who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said that it is really impossible to have a democracy in an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">uneducated country. I felt that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I still feel that one of the great pieces of damage which the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party did in the country was that they prevented what had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to happen from happening over a period. It would have been better</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for all of us, black and white, if the present position where you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have a complete democracy, in theory anyhow, had been reached more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gradually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That would, in the opinions I had then - and I am not entirely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prepared to run away from them - have been arrived at by having an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">educational qualification for the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I may have gone on too long because it became impractical. I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">think it was made impractical largely by liberal-minded people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rather than the right-wing people in the sense that they always</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">went for one man, one vote and they thought that anything else was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wrong and somewhat immoral. I don't think that, but of course it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would have reached the same point - the same result would have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been reached - and I wouldn't be surprised if it wouldn't have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been reached at about the same time. You would have had movement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gradually over a period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the benefit of hindsight, could more have been done to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">counter the trend over some four decades in which election after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">election more and more whites voted for the Nationalists?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oppenheimer: &quot;I certainly think we tried pretty hard. I am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">afraid they went that way because they were frightened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He turns away questions about his wealth and media comparisons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between him and the Sultan of Brunei, said to be the richest man</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the world, and Microsoft's Bill Gates. &quot;I'm lucky enough to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have money but I'm not in the same ballgame as those sort of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that you are in a country where there aren't vast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">numbers of people who have great fortunes as they have in America</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">means you stand out more than other people do. Also, because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">diamonds are sort of romantic and excite people, people imagine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the whole thing is much bigger than it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally, what would he most like to be remembered for?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You certainly want to be remembered for being better than you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">really were. I would like to be thought of as having lived a life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which on the whole gave proof of a certain degree of wisdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether I would justify such a recollection is for other people to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I would find it nice if that is the way people thought of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The media are less than honest in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statements to the truth commission regarding their role in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apartheid, argues Guy Berger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEARLY nobody noticed when FW de Klerk told the truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission last year that government disinformation &quot;could have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">created a climate&quot; allowing for gross human rights violations to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This surprise admission stands in contrast to the way the press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is analysing its role during apartheid. There has been some focus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on those worst-case journalists who spied and lied on behalf of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the system. The dirt is coming out on how weak or pro-apartheid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editors in the &quot;liberal&quot; press spiked and censored stories that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should have been published.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been criticism that conservatives in the &quot;mainstream&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media under PW Botha agreed to &quot;keep their house in order&quot;,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leaving it to the alternative weeklies to go it alone in exposing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the worst abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there has been very little assessment of how even the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">liberal press performed day-to-day legitimation of racial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">domination - even if some papers criticised the corruption and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crimes that flowed so logically from this system. The Sunday Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recently recanted some of its most brazen records, such as when it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">celebrated a murderous South African Defence Force raid on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana with the headline: &quot;The Guns of Gaborone&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Independent Newspapers drew up a dossier setting out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">historical &quot;shortcomings&quot; in the way its papers - under the Argus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">company - had accepted press restrictions. In hot response, four</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">retired editors of Independent papers have now defended their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">personal records as campaigners against apartheid's gross</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">violations of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvey Tyson, former editor of The Star, declared this week he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would never apologise for what he had done as a journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidently, he has forgotten the regret expressed in his book</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editors Under Fire. In it, he admits to having fallen for security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police manipulation in publicising allegations that &quot;KGB colonel&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Slovo had blown up his wife, Ruth First. Missing in all this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flurry, however, is any scrutiny of how everyday, routine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reporting reflected - and contributed to - a climate where black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lives were cheap and human rights went unrecognised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike government supporters like the late former Sunday Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editor, Tertius Myburgh, Harvey Tyson was a liberal editor. Yet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">like most whites, Tyson probably believed the Slovo story to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plausible at the time. He viewed his role as a watchdog -- but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">failed to see any difference between the legitimate property</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">owners and the real thieves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal press was, of course, not the same as the SABC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which never seriously claimed to be anything other than propaganda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not as different as people like Tyson would like to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">think. It reflected establishment assumptions where white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">newsmakers and white audiences counted. Blacks did not. Only a few</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">brave, white English-speaking journalists saw the role of black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resistance beyond their papers' liberal - and limited -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attacks by Nationalists added to the illusion harboured by many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white liberal journalists that the key actors were themselves and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the government. Not black South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an understandable thing for people to assume that they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are a leading force for freedom when victimised by a bullying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government, and enduring court cases and ever tighter legislative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal journalists may be forgiven for evaluating their role</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in relation to such pressures. But this logic does fail to locate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them in the broader sweep of things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal press operated in, and took its cues from, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prevailing white landscape. A handful of white editors rose above</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the conventional wisdom of the day. They &quot;opened an account&quot; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they paid a price: exile for Donald Woods, loss of their jobs in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the cases of Raymond Louw, Allister Sparks and Tony Heard. White</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists like these, who tried to lead the white readershp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">market, rather than follow its prejudices and its interests, also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ran into falling circulations. The decline was not compensated for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by black readers who failed to attract advertising revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it wasn't such context that constrained the role of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">liberal press, it was the confined outlook of most white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these journalists did campaign against &quot;petty&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apartheid. But macro- apartheid - especially after bantustan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">independence -- got less critical attention. Coverage sometimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pilloried the pass laws; it routinely neglected the wages paid to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">migrant workers. The problem with the liberal press is not only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that its opposition did not go far enough. Nor even that its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">champions like Tyson did not realise that there was a lot further</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was worse was the day-to-day reflection of what South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa was about. Black people were invisible in most newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you were Desmond Tutu, you got coverage - usually negative - in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Star. If you were a golf caddie featured in a Daily Dispatch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">picture, you'd be lucky to have even been photographed in the rain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standing next to white men enjoying the shelter of an umbrella,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with your name captioned as &quot;Jackson&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record of black journalistic advancement is similarly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pitiful. In 30 years, no white editor matched the record of Drum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editor, Anthony Sampson, who empowered an historic generation of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">top quality black reporters, writers and investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To understand all this context is not to justify the role of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the liberal press. It is to explain it. The press today is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unlikely to repeat its general complicity with the day-to-day,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">humdrum mechanics of racial domination. But liberal journalists -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of whatever colour - may continue to overlook their role in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legitimating other kinds of domination. This is the way that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media represents how men dominate women, adults abuse children,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">urban people scorn the rural, and the voices of the able drown out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">those of the disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FW de Klerk has acknowledged that the way that realities are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reflected can contribute to a climate where human rights are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">violated. Journalists need to do likewise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over recent months there have been grounds for uneasy suspicion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the high levels of lawlessness are not simply due to social</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deprivation and the criminality of its people, but that a hidden</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hand might be involved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disclosures relating to the involvement of a covert chemical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weapons industry in the manufacture of street drugs raise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">questions, for example, as to whether there was a conspiracy to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">subvert the black population --- to destroy their minds as part of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some crazed plot to maintain white rule. The notion seems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fantastic, but it would offer a possible explanation for otherwise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">improbable penetration of that particularly vicious drug, Mandrax,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into South Africa, which is said to account for 90% of world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if such a crazed plot was hatched under the old regime, is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it not still being pursued by the &quot;old guard&quot; which maintains a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">considerable influence in the new South African Police Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(SAPS)?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence before the truth commission has demonstrated how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individual members of the security forces enriched themselves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">while working to destabilise the country in the 1980s and early</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1990s. Do recent allegations of senior police involvement in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organised crime reflect a conspiracy to render the country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ungovernable --- at least for the African National Congress ---</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and profit personally by fomenting criminal activity ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the cock-up theory. The extraordinary disclosures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this week by the SAPS on police crime --- that proportionally more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police than members of the public were arrested for murder and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attempted murder last year, and twice as many &quot;lawmen&quot; were held</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for driving under the influence --- is a reminder that for decades</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the force was a safety net for the white unemployable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a heritage which guarantees cock-ups. And evidence of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cock-ups on a monumental scale was provided by similarly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">horrifying statistics which emerged last month on the register of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">firearms --- showing, among other things, that the police have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lost 18 600 guns, 1 103 of which have been relicensed to private</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individuals, and that 19 600 convicted criminals and 1 901 others</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">declared unfit to carry a gun have firearms licences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the government holds to the cock-up theory, we would suggest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a wholesale purge of the police is justified. At the very least it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will improve the criminal profile of the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the conspiracy theory holds sway, is it not time to get</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Richard Goldstone back in harness?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There is something a little distasteful about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Independent Group's &quot;confession&quot; to the Truth and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reconciliation Commission as to its sins during the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like its much-trumpeted &quot;international advisory board&quot; of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consultants, the submission smacks more of a public relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exercise than a genuine contribution to South African journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's apparent failure to consult some its key editors ---</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">serving and retired --- before submitting an apology on their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">behalf is both improper and symptomatic of the managerial ethos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which was in large part responsible for the feeble performance of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Argus stable in fighting apartheid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, without question, a need for critical examination of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the performance of South African media during the apartheid era,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including the &quot;liberal&quot; press. The appalling treatment of black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists should be central to such a critique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is to be expected --- demanded, if necessary --- of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">major newspaper groups which profited hugely from the apartheid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years that they facilitate and fund such an exercise. But it is an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exercise which does not fall within the purview of Desmond Tutu's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">overworked commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission was set up to investigate gross human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rights abuses and the factors which gave rise to them. By</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">troubling the commission with its comparatively petty squabbles,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the press is in danger of belittling the terrible pain suffered by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the victims of those atrocities, their families and their friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is a role for the truth commission where the newspaper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industry is concerned, it is in the limited but nonetheless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">important task of uncovering details of covert state operations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against the press. In particular, we would urge the commission to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">help identify government agents who infiltrated the country's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">independent newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We sympathise entirely with Thabo Mbeki's view that informers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should be forced into the open. It is unacceptable that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reputations of such people, who profited from a betrayal of trust,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should be protected in the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">abused at least one police aide-de-camp have begun &quot;in full</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seriousness&quot;, a police source said here this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commissioner (of police, Augustine Chiuri) said inquiries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would begin immediately, and they did,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would give no further details, but pointed out that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspector Jefta Dube, Banana's former aide who claimed that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ex-president had raped him, had indicated at least one police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officer - still in the force - and an army captain, were also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">victims.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube's claims surfaced during his trial for murder, in which he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">claimed he had killed another officer for calling him &quot;Banana's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">homosexual wife&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very important for us,&quot; the source said. &quot;There are a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lot of angry policemen over this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court heard that police had been receiving reports of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banana's alleged improprieties since 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube was sentenced last week to 10 years in jail for murdering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constable Patrick Mashiri in 1995. Dube's defence partially</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accepted by Judge David Bartlett, was that his ordeal under the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">former head of state caused him such severe psychological distress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that he was mentally disordered at the time of the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banana has made no attempt to change his normal routine, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turns up daily in his grey Gauteng-registered Mercedes at his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">office at the University of Zimbabwe where he heads the department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of religious studies. He has refused interviews, and told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reporters he is consulting his lawyers over the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's state-controlled media covered the issue as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">briefly as possible. The Herald, the country's main daily paper,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reported it under the headline: &quot;Policeman jailed for 10 years for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">murder.&quot; Banana's name was mentioned far down in the piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The privately owned Zimbabwe Independent, however, ran the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">story in detail, and the entire print run was sold out early last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday morning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - A hydro-electric project dam in northern Namibia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could displace 2 000 people. Graham Hopwood reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Himba people in north-west Namibia are battling a plan to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">construct a hydro-power station and dam on the Kunene River which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could flood up to 400km2 of their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want the construction of the dam. It's our ancestral</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">residence,&quot; says Himba chief Muatjindika Mutambo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the project designated for the Epupa area goes ahead, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Himba will not only lose grazing land, but also many of their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ancestral graves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutambo rejects the possibility that the government will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">compensate them financially if they move from the area. &quot;How do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you pay for ancestral graves with money?&quot; he asked at a recent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutambo travelled 900km to Windhoek last month to plead his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people's case against the dam, but his arguments have so far made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">little headway with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate over the dam is rapidly turning into a party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political war of words, with the Himba enlisting the support of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the official opposition, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swapo MP Angelika Muharukua is leading a campaign urging that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the dam be speeded up as it would bring development to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">isolated region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claims have suggested that the technical committee overseeing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the project is pressing ahead with plans for a massive dam against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the advice of official consultants from Norway and Sweden, who are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">currently conducting a feasibility study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feasibility team said in its first report that the final</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigations should concentrate on one site only - a smaller,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lower impact dam in the Baynes mountains. The Baynes option would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flood only 94km2 and directly affect about 100 Himba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team's report recommended that &quot;on the basis of technical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feasibility, economic viability and environmental acceptability&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Baynes option be subject to a full feasibility study and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">environmental impact assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Namibian-Angolan joint technical committee on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Epupa project differed with the consultants' findings. Although</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only Namibia will benefit from electricity generated by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project, Angolan representatives are serving on the technical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">committee since the Kunene River marks the border between the two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technical committee insisted, apparently at Namibia's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">urging, that a much larger dam site should also be included in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">final stage of the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee instructed the feasibility consultants to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continue their research on a site which would flood nearly 400km2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the Himba's land - affecting at least 2 000 people and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">destroying 160 ancestral graves and archaeological sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The larger site would also swamp the Epupa waterfalls tourist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attraction and have a much greater impact on the downstream</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a public consultation meeting two weeks ago it emerged that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Swedish and Norwegian governments, which have pumped the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">equivalent of R26-million into the study, will not fund the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigations into the second larger site, officially because of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;budget constraints&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result Namibia and Angola have agreed to find an extra R3-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million needed to research the viability of the larger dam site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local press reports have alleged that the Namibian government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is insisting on the site at Epupa because it wants &quot;a prestige</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project&quot; which means having a massive dam regardless of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">objections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imker Hoogenhout, a spokesman for the technical committee, said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the larger site has been added because the smaller Baynes option</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would be highly dependent on the proper functioning of the Gove</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dam in southern Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gove was badly damaged during the Angolan war and has not yet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been fully repaired. Hoogenhout maintains that because of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">uncertainties over peace in Angola, it is too risky to concentrate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">solely on the Baynes site and therefore another option is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feasibility study group is due to make a final</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recommendation later this year and if it gives the go-ahead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">construction could start before the end of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian government says the 300 megawatt power plant and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dam are necessary to make Namibia energy self-sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists opposing the dam argue that the government would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do better to concentrate on the offshore Kudu gas field and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">alternative energy sources to meet the rising demand for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upping the political ante surrounding the project DTA vice-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">president Katuutire Kaura has claimed that it would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unconstitutional for the government to take communal land from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Himba. He argues that under the country's supreme law, a council</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of traditional leaders which would include Himba chiefs should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advise the president on the use of communal land. The council has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not been convened since independence in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a counter move Swapo supporters in favour of the Epupa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project have called for a referendum in the Kunene region to</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government sources in Harare have been upbeat about the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whether this will translate into money and jobs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">swelling by 250 000 a year. But Zimbabwe's leadership has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sending mixed signals on whether it really wants foreign</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many respects things are looking up. Reserve Bank governor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leonard Tsumba has forecast 4,9% growth this year. But while a</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the problem in London remains one of perception as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">businessmen challenged Mugabe on fundamentals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent interviews Mugabe has spoken of former colonisers</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Britain remains Zimbabwe's largest investor, with 300</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are going back to Zim in their droves, reports Iden Wetherell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Rhodesians are coming! Thousands of citizens of rebel prime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">minister Ian Smith's former white bastion who fled majority rule</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in 1980 to seek refuge in apartheid South Africa are now flocking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">back across the border. And they appear to be escaping the same</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">realities that precipitated their hasty exit from Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic South Africa's embrace of affirmative action is seen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a key factor in propelling many ex-&quot;Rhodies&quot; back across the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limpopo. But in addition to no longer feeling wanted in their</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">former sanctuary, there is the lure of easy money back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, which in recent years has opened up its economy, now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provides lucrative prospects in business, especially for those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with capital outside the country. And while black empowerment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rhetoric is strong, the private sector remains largely in white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hands operating in places on an extensive old-boy network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many returning ex-Rhodesians bring business skills and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment plans, they are by no means universally welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the Nazi war criminals who went to South America never</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dreamt of coming back as they would have been tried for crimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against humanity,&quot; complained the Sunday Mail, a ruling Zanu-PF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">party mouthpiece, &quot;the Rhodesians who aided and abetted acts of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">atrocities against the black population are on the contrary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">singing 'Home Sweet Home' &quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration department has said it is processing an average</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">100 applications a month from South Africa. In December the number</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shot up to 393. This includes an unspecified number of South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans who see their future in Zimbabwe where whites number 80</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">000 in a total population of 11- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economic situation in Zimbabwe still favours the white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community and that is why South Africans find it easier to come</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and live here because they can still be in control,&quot; a senior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government official told the local press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No figures are given for the number of applications that are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rejected but it is believed applicants who served in certain units</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Smith's security forces are unlikely to get back in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994 the supreme court upheld the government's refusal to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grant automatic return to people who were born in Zimbabwe but had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">renounced their citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, for those who make it life is good. &quot;It's definitely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">slower here but much more relaxed,&quot; said &quot;Max&quot; who asked to remain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">anonymous. &quot;There are no carjackings, the weather is better and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people are much friendlier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Max, who left Zimbabwe in 1980 and worked for 15 years in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg, now runs his own advertising company. He said many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of his friends had also returned, some of them feeling they had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reached a glass ceiling in their workplaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The return of the emigr' Rhodesians coincides with a growing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">self-confidence - some would say arrogance - on the part of many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white Zimbabweans who no longer feel overawed by a government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whose record on economic management is attracting growing</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maun - A NEW initiative by the Botswana government to remove</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bushmen from their ancestral lands in the Central Kalahari Game</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reserve - to make way for tourism and mining - has backfired, with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hundreds of Bushmen agreeing to accept cash in return for moving,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but then changing their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People think they are being given big money, it is said it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be enough for one person to buy two new cars. This is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">true,&quot; says a disgusted Aaron Johannes, a member of Kgeikani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kweni, The First People of the Kalahari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannes says one family of 13 has already moved out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mothomelo, one of seven villages in the reserve which is home to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about 3 000 people according to Bushmen - although official</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">figures estimate the population is 1 300.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of people signed up for the scheme initially, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apparently now have changed their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reserve was set up in 1961 for &quot;wild Bushmen&quot;, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">villagers say the Botswana government now wants to turn the place</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into a big safari camp and develop mining in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has sent young people to take down the names of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">those who want to move,&quot; explains Johannes. &quot;We will help and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">support those who want to stay. Now we are always in the game</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reserve because sometimes if we are not, people are told bad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">things. They are told the army will shoot them if they don't move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now people are afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana's government has always maintained that no one is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being forced to relocate. But last February, when new resettlement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plans were announced, villagers were told that if they didn't move</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">out, they would no longer receive social services and that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xade school and clinic would not be upgraded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the words of one official, &quot;infrastructure in the game</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reserve will be left ... but there won't be any more because the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">population will be going down&quot;. To many observers this was just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">another form of removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a government statement last February, the majority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of people in the reserve were &quot;in favour of resettling outside&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But testimonies from five people who attended a series of public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">meetings tell another story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What worries me is this: I, myself, cannot be removed from my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ancestral homes with my people,&quot; said Roy Sesana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government wants us to remain detribalised in order for us to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">come and work for others and live lives of poverty and suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling back my culture, a lion was a friend of mine. Why today is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a lion to be given more development and I not given the same?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villagers have long maintained that the government is merely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bribing them to go, and in some cases harassing them in order to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drive them away. They claim in the past 10 years numerous Bushmen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have been arrested for hunting violations, and have been jailed,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beaten and tortured for being &quot;poachers&quot;. Such allegations have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">also been reported by Amnesty International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the pioneering work of the late John Hardbattle which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">really brought world attention to the fate of the people within</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the reserve. Hardbattle, who was the director of Kgeikani Kweni,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">worked tirelessly canvassing for international support for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalahari Bushmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sponsored by the First Nations Development Institute in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States, in 1995 he travelled to Washington and New York</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where he was christened &quot;The Bushman's advocate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1996 he flew to Geneva where, in two five-minute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sessions before the United Nations High Commission on Racism,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardbattle told the world that people would be removed from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reserve by cattle trucks in May. Before he had finished speaking,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">60 copies of his presentation had been snapped up. Shortly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">afterwards the British House of Lords entered the fray and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demanded that the removal be formally protested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Botswana government was not amused by the uproar, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardbattle was accused in Botswana's Parliament of acting in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;clandestine manner&quot;. He died last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to obtain comments from government officials this week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the cash offers were unsuccessful. - Okavango Observer</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and cowhide jewellery (which smells pretty foul) given to her by a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spiritualist from the Ivory Coast. &quot;I wear them when I'm feeling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">down,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So campaigners bent on frustrating her business plans, beware:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who knows what could happen if this flamboyant former beauty queen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gets really mad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modjadji's upmarket shebeen, Mama's Jazz Joint, is a haven for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the country's new black elite and for whites who want a taste of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">township entertainment without straying too far from home. She</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says racism is behind the campaign to drive her out of Dunkeld</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White people see things in a different perspective. Many are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scared to have our culture so near. There is a white social club</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">next door and no one complains. There are also two brothels just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up the road, but they too are white and therefore culturally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">acceptable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't understand how they can forget so fast. Does rainbow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nation mean that we have to adopt their ways? Where is the spirit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of reconciliation Mandela talks about?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of her neighbours in this traditionally white area have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been petitioning for two years to have Mama's ousted from its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">luxury setting, tucked among other service-related businesses on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan Smuts Avenue. They say it is a noisy shebeen and should not be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowed in a residential area. Some are worried Mama's presence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will drive down property prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a shebeen. It's a private social club,'' snaps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modjadji, her long braided hair swirling around her neck as she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pivots to survey the scene. &quot;Where have you ever seen a shebeen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with a pool and 10 rooms - including private suites, restaurants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and a conference room? In fact, there is more noise from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">street than the club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club may be upmarket (membership is R500), but everyone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">knows you only have to get a small group of black folks together</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and their boisterous enjoyment of life can sound like rowdy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">football supporters after their team has won a major championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I certainly would not like to live nearby, but then I am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exceptionally noise- sensitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its opening in 1994, when Hugh Masekela played live in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the garden, Mama's has risen to almost cult status as the place to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hang out for returned exiles, ex- soldiers, Inkatha people,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">foreign embassy officials and many government members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale (a close friend of Modjadji since</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her youth) is a frequent visitor and Labour Minister Tito Mboweni</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">even has a special room set aside for him and his guests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club's interior is like someone's living room, though the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dim red lights give it a slightly seedy air. Maroon is the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dominant colour, lending the place a down- market Indian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">restaurant look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mama's is for everyone. It's about South Africa's tradition of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hospitality, but people feel more comfortable aligning it with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shebeen, which is an illegal drinking tavern - this is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">illegal. I'm deliberately being messed about by racists who don't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">want to mix. What they are really saying is that our culture is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not welcome in their cosy suburbs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvula &quot;Charmaine&quot; Mapula Modjadji was born in Payneville, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">township on the gold reef surrounding Johannesburg. She moved to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soweto in 1972 after taking up journalism with The World</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">newspaper, forerunner to the Sowetan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though untrained and fresh out of high school, she persuaded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the editor she could write feature articles, soon becoming a star</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contributor to the women's page. Apartheid was at its height and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the northern suburbs were as unknown to her as a foreign country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wasn't legally allowed to visit white suburbs and so didn't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">know them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her first visit to the home of a white liberal colleague was a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">revelation: &quot;I was stunned and could not understand how a family</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of five could live in such a big house with so many rooms.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her traditional box-like four-room township family house had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only two bedrooms. Here she grew up with four siblings, her mother</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a domestic servant) and grandmother. &quot;It was my grandmother who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">showed me that the strength, power and determination of one person</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can make a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a year in journalism, Modjadji put her natural beauty and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">slim figure to use in modelling. She won the Miss Black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg beauty pageant and landed the coveted assignment as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the first black woman to have her face plastered on an advertising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">billboard - for Lux beauty soap - in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year later Modjadji moved into the rag trade as public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relations representative and then buyer for a major clothing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outlet, winning it big business from black communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was followed by a stint in the music business, working for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner Bros as a marketing manager until 1979, and several months</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a beauty consultant for Flora Roberts cosmetics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then won her biggest prize: a United Nations scholarship to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunter College in New York City. She has a BA degree in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">communication and a master's degree in film and music from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of California at Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her time in the United States included four years in Hawaii,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before she returned to South Africa in 1993 because she &quot;wanted to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be part of the changes taking place in my homeland&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But returning home after 16 years of self- imposed exile, she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says the attitudes of many racists have not changed, and that is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">why many black people will not move to the suburbs. &quot;They believe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they don't belong, and this case shows they have a point. I'm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">basically being told I can only live among whites if I play by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their rules.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wants a place where people can pitch up any time, in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tradition of shebeens in black areas, which are usually situated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the heart of residential areas - rather in the same way Britain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has pubs on just about every street corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why should I not be able to have a club in the suburb? The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Group Areas Act no longer exists. This place has zoning rights for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a social club, so technically I'm not breaking the law ... It's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the blackness that is a problem.&quot; She plans to discuss the issue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on next Monday's Felicia Mabuza- Shuttle Show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modjadji applied for a social club licence when she opened in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1994, but before the tribunal had made its ruling the council had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obtained a court order shutting her down. The tribunal later</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rejected her application and she is to appeal on March 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was told I had to be living here while the application for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consent to use it as a club was being considered. So I sold my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">house in Randburg and signed a lease, with the option to buy after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was supposed to be a pilot scheme: &quot;I have international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investors ready to fund a franchise of similar clubs across the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country. But I can't take anyone's money when the ship is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">smelling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She points out much of that end of Jan Smuts Avenue has already</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been zoned for business. &quot;The council's propaganda is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concentrating on noise, blowing things out of proportion; they act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as if what I'm doing is illegal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mickey Baloyi, product development manager for Johnnie Walker,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is a supporter and regular customer: &quot;This place is like a bridge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between two cultures. It's a home away from home for blacks who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have moved into previously white suburbs. It's also a place where</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business deals are made.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the neighbours are not impressed. One allegedly told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modjadji he would spend every penny he has to shut her down. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been trying to sell his house for more than a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modjadji, who has a 25-year-old son and a nine-month-old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grandchild, says it is clear &quot;there is a concerted effort by those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representing white business interests to ensure that I don't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operate within 'their' territory. I suggest they wake up to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">realisation that they now have to share this land more equally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The queen has spoken.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE government is trying to revive the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential Review Commission, created to help reform the ailing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">public sector but paralysed by its own problems, which culminated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recently in the resignation of its chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Bax Nomvete, who by all accounts had a stormy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relationship with the rest of the commission, has refused to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comment on his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining commission members last weekend met Dr Paseka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncholo, the director general of public services and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">administration, in an attempt to shore up the commission and to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rethink its mission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, which was due to present President Nelson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela with its recommendations for revamping the public service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in August, will ask for another 12 months to finish the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Services and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncholo and commission members reportedly want to replace Nomvete</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with Dr Vincent Maphai, a member of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consultative committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission was created to shake up the public service,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which has long been viewed as bloated, backward and inefficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none of the R12-million committed by foreign donors to pay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for its work has been spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has been hampered instead by administrative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hitches and in-fighting between its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skweyiya, under pressure to show results, allegedly threatened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to close the commission last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member told the Mail &amp; Guardian: &quot;People remain seriously</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demoralised about the commission's performance.&quot; Prior to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weekend's gathering, it had looked dead in the water, the member</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past six months, the commission has held a two-day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">methodology workshop, a round-table discussion in November to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">establish a working relationship with its taskteams and a further</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">workshop with members of the Commonwealth Secretariat. It has done</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more than 500 hours of work in 13 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission will have to co-ordinate its investigations with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the new Public Service Commission, to be set up later this year,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because it will be tackling the same task with similar terms of</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Aliens are arrested and imprisoned without</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consideration for their rights, reports Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RAPHAEL MAVUDZI was not the first visitor to South Africa from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">north of the border to fail to have his papers in order. Nor was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he the first to be arrested for that failure, under the Aliens</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Control Act, and thrown into the dismal holding cells of the Sea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Point police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unlike the six men packed into the tiny cell with him,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">waiting for the police to take some action, Mavudzi, a respected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sculptor from Zimbabwe, knew he had the right to a lawyer. And a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">series of phone calls from friend to friend brought Cape Town</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attorney Gary Eisenberg to his cell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavudzi, who had been invited to South Africa in April by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartel Arts Trust in Durban, had been in police custody for two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">days by the time Eisenberg got to him, following a tip-off from a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conditions were appalling and unhygenic,&quot; said Mavudzi at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the weekend, just before he flew home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The blankets were wet with pee and there was garbage on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">floor ... we had to beg them for a broom to sweep it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police did not treat us with dignity. The food was awful -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there were no washing facilities. We had to buy our own drinks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time Eisenberg had got Mavudzi out of the cell, the rest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the men in the cell had signed themselves up as his clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until they had met Mavudzi, none had known they were entitled to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legal counsel, or that they could challenge the law under which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they were held on its lack of constitutionality. Nobody had read</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to the cells and saw a bunch of people in little</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cages,&quot; Eisenberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the people I spoke to had valid holiday permits, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had been arrested on suspicion of working or hawking illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Affairs did not interview the people they were holding in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cells and it is clear from what I saw they do not assess each case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on its own merits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavudzi said negotiations between Eisenberg and the Barrack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Street Home Affairs Department had been slow because they had not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been able to raise anybody on Friday. Most senior officials were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at a party to bid farewell to a senior director, who was leaving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to set up a private immigration consultancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between cellphone calls to Home Affairs officials, Eisenberg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">started chatting to Mavudzi about his artwork and soon they were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">swopping notes on cubism, Picasso and the influence of African art</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on European artists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eisenberg offered to provide a R1900 deposit to Home Affairs to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">release Mavudzi - the deposit is supposed to be refunded once</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavudzi crosses the border - and helped Mavudzi buy his airticket</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also gave Mavudzi cash, which Eisenberg said he needed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because he could not return to his wife and son empty-handed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In exchange, Mavudzi sold Eisenberg a sculpture, and left a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">number behind for Eisenberg to sell for him through tourist shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sculptures fetch between R15000 and R30 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavudzi came to South Africa six months ago, invited by art</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gallery curators to conduct stone sculpture workshops with victims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the KwaZulu-Natal war as part of a rehabilitation therapy. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">displayed two sculptures at the Zimbabwe National Gallery in 1993</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and 1994. The acting exhibition director, Rose West, said the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">works were original and differed from curio-type sculptures. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sculptures had been called The Bomb-blast Victim and The Sleep-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">walker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavudzi was to have done a further workshop at the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Gallery in Cape Town this week. But officials had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refused to give him a work permit because he was an artist. He had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to travel instead on a holiday visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very difficult to come to South Africa from Zimbabawe. I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do rehabilitative work with young people of all races and art to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">me has no boundaries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not because I want to leave my country that I'm here, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because I want to expand my knowledge and share my experience with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eisenberg organised the release of the rest of the other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">detainees on condition that they would see themselves out of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country by train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this week that he will make it a habit to check on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">holding cells from time to time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His anger is not directed at the Home Affairs officials, but at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the law that prompts and governs their actions, which he says is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Constitution says nobody can be detained after arrest for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">longer than 48 hours, but the Act allows Home Affairs to detain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">immigrants indefinitely without them being formally charged,&quot; he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Home Affairs officials say they persist in following this rule</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because it is practice although they know about the constitutional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their loyalty is to the carrying out of the law, but since the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">law itself is rotten, this leads to all kinds of irregularities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Home Affairs officials: &quot;We went out of our way to treat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">him in a fair and reasonable manner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they treat &quot;all detainees well&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Guest writer Pippa Green watches the truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission catch fire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE is a monument outside Pretoria's vast municipal complex,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a broken arch of triumph. Its dedication reads: &quot;To all victims of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terrorism.&quot; It stands on the corner of Munitoria, a distinctly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretorian name in a city where names like Cartoria for a major</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">vehicle dealer are common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of the great fire that all but destroyed Munitoria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this week, the two-metre-high block of granite and steel provided</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a convenient place for police to cordon off the pavement to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provide a kind of holding area where the steady stream of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">firefighters could regroup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That day in Munitoria, the Truth and Reconciliation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission's amnesty committee had heard evidence from a white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaans man who provided instant delight to the pens of foreign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists. If you want to fuel a stereotype, look no further</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">than Colonel Marthinus Ras, the man who gave the orders to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">death squad to kill a black Mamelodi policeman, Sergeant Richard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matosi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ras is thick-necked and tight-mouthed - adjectives when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">juxtaposed with the noun &quot;Afrikaner&quot;, as they were recently in an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American magazine, made me chastise the writer who'd put them on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">paper. But there he was, looking like that, telling an incredulous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">amnesty committee that he'd ordered Warrant Officers Jacques</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hechter and Paul van Vuuren to &quot;eliminate&quot; Matosi without so much</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as shuffling the paper on his desk, or looking in a file to see</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what evidence there was that the Mamelodi policeman was an African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Congress agent. And, he says, when Matosi's wife, Irene,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was killed, he didn't even ask why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the day when the lawyer for the five policemen asking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for amnesty reluctantly dropped the word &quot;terrorist&quot;. There was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">little mistaking his disingenuous tone when he asked ANC MP, Moss</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chikane, whether Dr Fabian Ribeiro, another victim of the Hechter-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Vuuren team, had treated &quot;freedom fighters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then that night outside Munitoria, as blue and orange</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flames exploded the aluminium window frames on the north side of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the building, intelligence agents of the new government gathered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">around the Victims of Terrorism monument without noticing it,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wondering perhaps what kind of terrorism they were dealing with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">now. The documents of the truth commission, they asked, where</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exactly are they?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they watched the flames leap and curl, Gerrie van Niekerk, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">young man from the Pretoria Fire Department, was battling his way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through thick smoke up to the fifth floor on the northern side of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the building to make sure the flames did not jump across to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">part where the amnesty committee was sitting. While he was there,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in swirling grey smoke that blinded him, a roar rumbled through</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the building - like an earthquake, he said afterwards, and he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">didn't know where it was coming from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerrie van Niekerk, like Ras, speaks Afrikaans as a home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">language. His neck is not thick. His mouth is not tight. His eyes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are a wide-open blue, of the sort that people admire in children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he does, he says, he does for the community, and he's proud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to do it. But that night he trembled, as much as a man can tremble</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a sweltering fire-suit, and thought of his baby daughter, as he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">realised the &quot;earthquake&quot; was the floors above him collapsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broken arch of triumph outside the Munitoria Building</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">represents humanity, human life cut short, or so says its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">explanation. Ras was the last to give evidence before the amnesty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">committee in Munitoria that afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the light outside paled, Ras explained how his superior, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">divisional commissioner of police, a Brigadier Stemmet, had told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">him to order the Hechter- Van Vuuren duo to cut short the life of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a man the state called an enemy. It wasn't so much the act of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elimination - to use a police euphemism - that directed the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">questions from Brian Currin, the lawyer for the families, or the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">amnesty judges - but the fact that he had given the orders on one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scrap of hearsay evidence that Matosi was an ANC agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currin put the question: &quot;If you'd been given that sort of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">information about anyone else, you would have been quite happy to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">say, that's fine, eliminate?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ras answered in Afrikaans: &quot;I would have, but I myself would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have made sure that he was an enemy of the state, and then I would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have executed the operation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you were a police officer, not a judge and not an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">executioner.&quot; Currin puts this as a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is so, but we did not live in normal circumstances, Mr</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You get asked on a flimsy bit of information to provide a hit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">squad and kill a man,&quot; says Judge Andrew Wilson to the large man</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the witness chair who is showing only the slightest prickling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of sweat. &quot;No written instructions, no other information. How is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it that a policeman of your standing can act in this way,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colonel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such snippets of information came often to the security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">branch, and I saw this piece as one .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You gave the instructions to kill this man,&quot; says an impatient</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson, his voice rising. &quot;You are responsible for the death of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this man and his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ras sighs, a long heavy sigh. &quot;That is so, Mr Chairman. I'm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">responsible because I said to them that there's a request from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">divisional commissioner that this man must be killed and they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Hechter and Van Vuuren) must do the work.&quot; After the job, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">matter was not spoken about again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Matosis' young son, a boy who had just passed babyhood at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the time his parents were killed, wailed all night beside the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bodies of his dead parents. When Ras is done, the amnesty judges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">go home. So do the victims' families, the truth commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials, the policemen, the lawyers. Everyone except my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indefatigable radio colleagues go home. They settle down to work</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Ras's testimony, and Antjie Samuels, my colleague, has just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finished her script when the fire alarms go off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heaviness and trauma of Ras's testimony is quickly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forgotten in the hysterical jollity that often surrounds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disasters.We stand on the street as flames from the northern block</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the building lick their way through it, crumpling metal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">windows, collapsing concrete, exploding the methane gas in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">air-conditioning system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuels and another radio reporter, Angie Kaplianis, are street</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">celebrities. The local newspaper takes their picture. The head of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the buildings' security, a carelessly cheerful Brian Williams,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says that they can move the hearings and then, when the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intelligence agents rush in with cellphones and worried</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expressions, they want to talk to them, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus of attention is on those outside and on the flames</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that are beginning to leap across from the block where they have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">eaten up the licensing and water and electricity departments to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the main block where the amnesty committee is sitting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one, though, seems then to notice the steady lines of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">firefighters entering the building, half of which is now a great</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">red and blue wall of flame. Dark figures holding hosepipes stand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the roof of the burning section of building, aiming water jets,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in seeming futility, against sheets of flames that are at least</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two stories high. A pisdraatjie (a piddle), says Williams</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cheerily. Actually the firefighters say they used 50 000 cubic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">litres of water a second. Over the 15-odd hours they battled the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flames, that's nearly 50-million cubic litres. A thousand swimming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pools-worth for those who live in the suburbs, a dam for those who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other fire departments screech in to help the embattled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria firefighters: from Midrand, from Sandton, from the air</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">force and the army. By the next morning, fire departments from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">East Rand are also there. The firefighters - young men just out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their teens for the most part - traipse into the milky white smoke</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the southern block which is not yet burning. One falls off the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collapsing roof as he struggles up with a hose and hurts his back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several lie on the roadside, quietly gasping for breath, but no-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one except ambulance men talk to them. Two soot-faced spluttering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">firefighters, battling to get the smoke out of their lungs, ask</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaplianis for her last two cigarettes. She hands them over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks,&quot; they say. &quot;Ons soek asem. (We need breath).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After midnight, we follow a train of thirsty-looking people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">down the steps of an escalator. We step off on to the edge of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beachsand and a mural of swaying palm-trees with a sign saying,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coconut Club. A lithe - but I mean lithe - dark-haired girl in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a silver bikini walks out of the club, filled with fake swirls of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">smoke and throbbing red lights, to see the real thing across the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">road. The Pretoria patrons jump and jive to a doof-doof version of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alanis Morissette: &quot;And I'm here to remind you, of the mess you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">left when you went away ...&quot; Thinking the ever-helpful Williams</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">needs a break, we tell him about the girl in the silver bikini in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the club, and he says, no, he's not &quot;lus vir meisies in costumes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nie (He does not fancy girls in swimming costumes)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before two in the morning, the wind comes up and the fire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leaps the barriers that the fire-soldiers have battled to place in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the southern block. It sweeps in a zig-zag through the top floor,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">then the next one, then the one after that, like a sharp knife</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cutting through canvas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Niekerk is on the fifth floor, three floors below the fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission's documents are six floors below. Misjudging</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the firefighters' ability, I assume they're gone. I do not know</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">then that there are still firefighters on almost every floor of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the burning building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the light of the next day, when the flames are doused, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the smoke is still billowing, I see the truth commission's Koki</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpshe walk out of the building in fireman's overalls carrying two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">briefcases full of documents. The transcripts of the amnesty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hearings are in there, safe. Ras's words have not burnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see also Van Niekerk, who is now into the 33rd hour of his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shift. Van Niekerk has been a fireman since the age of 17. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feels proud, he says, to be a fireman, to do something for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community. This was a towering inferno, he says, and it was just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">great to be here. You have to be cool to be a fireman, he says,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">even in a hot fire-suit that sends your heartbeat up from 80 to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">150 beats a minute. And then there's the 19kg oxygen pack and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tramping up and down stairs dragging fire hoses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But things aren't quite as simple. He recalls what happened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when the roof above him collapsed. the smoke in front of him was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white-grey. The heat was intense - some say up to 50000 degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had one vision when the roof collapsed above him. &quot;I saw my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">child's face,&quot; he says. A girl, he says, crying openly, five</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">months old, and then he can't say any more. His eyes are reddened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by smoke and tears. He talks about his colleagues, about the new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">councillors that have thanked them for doing their duty, about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adrenaline that pumped through him the night before. He does not</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young, white Afrikaner, he stood his ground on the fifth</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ask him whether they pay him a fortune for what he does. Not a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fortune, he says, but enough to keep a home, to feed his wife and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">five-month-old baby, a little girl, called Bianca.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE Durban High Court ruled this week that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela has the right, if he chooses, to appoint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">biased and partial commissions of inquiry, and that citizens have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">no legal recourse to oppose them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling by Judge Ron McLaren followed the leak of documents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from a secret October 1996 meeting between Education Minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibusiso Bengu, four members of the University of Durban-Westville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(UDW) council and Durban attorney Linda Zama. Zama is a member of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the commission of inquiry appointed last May to investigate unrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the UDW campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents, described by the court as &quot;aides-memoires&quot;,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suggested that the participants planned to use the recent problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the university to justify ministerial involvement in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appointment of a new vice- chancellor. They also mention</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">establishing an &quot;intelligence network&quot; on the campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UDW's Combined Staff Association (Comsa) and nine other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individuals, including six Comsa members and three students, had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gone to court seeking an interdict to prevent Zama from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participating in the commission, arguing that her participation in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the meeting was &quot;unlawful&quot; and suggested her role in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission was not impartial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But delivering judgment after a tense day of argument, Judge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McLaren dismissed the application with costs, saying the court</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;has no power to interfere with the composition of the commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or to grant the relief sought by the applicants&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge McLaren said in his judgment that &quot;it is the prerogative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the state president to decide who to appoint to a commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the commission is comprised of non-impartial members, it is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the status of the commission which will suffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers said the judgment was likely to cause renewed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conflict on campus after six months of calm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comsa's counsel Archie Findlay, SC, argued that the interim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitution --- applicable when the commission was formed in May</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996 --- assured citizens a right to &quot;lawful and fair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">administrative action&quot; against the absolute nature of presidential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prerogative held by previous governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the court heard that Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's absence had signed the proclamation appointing the UDW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission, had invoked the 1947 Commissions Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act enshrined presidential prerogative with respect to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operation of the commission and its terms of reference. Only the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">office of the president could determine whether such a commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was bound by the Constitution or other rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting historical cases, Zama's counsel, Malcolm Wallis, SC,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said the nature of presidential commissions of inquiry was such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that they were not legally binding judicial bodies, and that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constitutional protections demanded by Comsa did not apply to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their operation. The commission was &quot;merely an advisory body to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the executive&quot; and its functions were therefore not open to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">judicial review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge McLaren further accepted Wallis's contention that Comsa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and its fellow applicants had failed to prove that their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">application was &quot;urgent&quot;, or that Zama's conduct, or the contents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the secret meeting, were &quot;sinister&quot; or in any way compromised</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the work of the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Zama) gave unchallenged evidence that she told (Bengu) she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">did not want to discuss the manner in which the commission does</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its work ... she said 'I deny that I have a pre- determined</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policy, perception and agenda with respect to the university ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My involvement at UDW and in the commission is dispassionate and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">professional,'&quot; Judge McLaren said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge added that even if he did have the power to grant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relief in terms of the application, he &quot;would not exercise that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">power in (the applicants') favour&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the application as &quot;ill-founded&quot;, he suggested that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comsa should give evidence to the commission in terms of subpoenas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">issued to several of the applicants the commission has accused of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">criminal and/or disciplinary offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comsa has boycotted the commission since its inception and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">within weeks of the commission's appointment sent letters to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission chair Johann Gautschi and Mandela alleging Zama and co-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commissioner Jerry Coovadia could not be impartial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the court ruling, Comsa said: &quot;While the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitution of South Africa gives us certain rights and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">protections, the court refused to help us ... The struggle to keep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political interference out of education has begun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bengu this week blamed &quot;a small element&quot; of people for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trying to dislodge the commission and said this was &quot;because they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have something to hide&quot;. He denied the meeting had been &quot;secret&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and claimed the minute-taker had been &quot;creative&quot; in his record of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UDW vice-rector Pitika Ntuli said it was ironic that the campus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had been the &quot;most united in its entire career&quot; in the week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">preceding the exposure of the secret meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then the document hit our desks with the suggestion of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possibility of the creation of a network of spies, with serious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">questions for academic freedom. To even suggest such a thing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">raises a spectre we have just emerged from in the dark days of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apartheid. After months of building a united front between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">students, Comsa and management, that document has come like a bolt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from hell's kitchen, barbequeing our hopes for this campus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Natal constitutional law professor Kathie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Govender, who is also a member of the Human Rights Commission,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said the courts had been divided on the issue of presidential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prerogative in the post-1994 era, with two judges coming to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposing conclusions in separate cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What one is saying is there is an area of executive competence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which is beyond the constitution,&quot; she said. &quot;I'd have been safer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with a ruling that says the court does have jurisdiction to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constrain the president's actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A series of sensational allegations against SABC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bosses about a top-selling TV show will result in arbitration,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reports Peta Thornycroft</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE heads of SABC1 and 2 have been accused of illegally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">removing property from the offices of an independent television</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">producer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of a series of sensational allegations involving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prominent television and media personalities that will be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arbitrated by advocate Gilbert Marcus, SC, later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent producer Johanna Makgalemele has asked for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arbitration over the termination of her contract with the SABC for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her series Women on the Move. The only official explanation the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC has given is in a letter to Makgalemele: &quot;As a result of all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the problems which were experienced with the first 13 episodes no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decision has been taken regarding any further episodes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents in the possession of the SABC allege Thandi Thaninga-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Msimango, head of SABC2, and Molefe Mokgatle, boss of SABC1,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ordered a raid on the offices of Makgalemele in November last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The saga began last August when Johanna Makgalemele, sister of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">former Miss South Africa Basetsana Makgalemele, presented a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proposal to SABC 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept was accepted and a contract entered into between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johanna Makgalemele's company and the SABC to produce 52 episodes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the Women on the Move series. Makgalemele was to produce and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">present each 26-minute episode. After the first 13 had been made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and had attracted excellent advertising and top audience ratings,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the SABC informed Makgalemele she was to make no more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arbitration hearing will have access to letters written by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makgalemele; a former employee of hers, Lloyd Power; Msimango; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media personality and editor of Enterprise magazine Thami Mazwai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai was not a party to the contract for Women on the Move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet he wrote to his friend Msimango saying women interviewed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the series had been &quot;humiliated&quot;. Shortly afterwards,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makgalemele learnt from the SABC she would be making no more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">episodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai's only involvement in the series was an offer of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">research --- to identify women who were making it in various</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fields. In return, he was given valuable publicity. Mazwai's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">magazine featured prominently in several of the interviews and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">according to some in the production team, Makgalemele became</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">increasingly irritated by his alleged interference and his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">magazine's repeated exposure in a series in which he was not a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contractual party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power, a hairdresser-turned-television- producer, wrote to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makgalemele with a long list of grievances and resigned from her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">company on November 26 after the first few episodes were in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For reasons which are not clear from the file of documents at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the SABC, Power also sent a copy of his letter of resignation to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Msimango at SABC2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later, according to documents in the SABC's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possession, Power went to Makgalemele's offices in Houghton,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg and seized documents, film tapes, a computer, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other items including a petty cash cheque. Power has written a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statement claiming he did this on the orders of Msimango and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokgatle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter signed by Esthea du Toit from the legal department,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the SABC has acknowledged it has some of Makgalemele's possessions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but says it is making sure none of the items seized belong to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series Women on the Move, now renamed Lebone and with new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">presenters, continues to be shown on Monday nights on SABC2 with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sets remarkably like those which belonged to Makgalemele. Credits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the end of the programme list LP Productions as the producers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Power's and Enterprise magazine's names appear as integrally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involved in the series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai has made it widely known he now wishes to become</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contractually involved in the lucrative series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian made every effort to get a comment from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai on Wednesday evening, and on Thursday morning read him the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">section of the report where he is named. The whole report was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">faxed to his office for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said on Thursday: &quot;You should have given me time to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are serious allegations. I am in the middle of a meeting ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am in Cape Town. You are being unprofessional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether he was contractually involved in any way with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">series, he said: &quot;This doesn't give the whole picture. I cannot do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business this way.&quot; And he hung up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC's general manager for corporate communications Enoch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sithole said: &quot;We will not comment now, there is a process of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigation going on and there are two sides of the story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The publicity department of the SABC said it was unable to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supply photographs of Msimango without permission from Sithole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makgalemele is understood to have asked SABC to restore the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">series to her and for compensation for losses incurred since it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was reassigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makgalemele has been advised by her legal team to make no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comment to the press until the arbitration is over.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - OLIVER HILL, South Africa's most wanted white-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collar fugitive, could be back home in a matter of weeks,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">following the rejection this week by a London court of his appeal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against extradition to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also torpedoed Hill's attempts to further delay his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">return by denying him the right to appeal to the House of Lords,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's highest court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African officials working with England's Crown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecution Service say the high court quashed both his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">application to be released from prison - known as a habeas corpus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">application - and his appeal against a ruling last year by the Bow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Street Magistrate's Court to extradite him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a question of if, it's when ...'' said an official</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who has been working on the case from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill's return would give the Reserve Bank the chance to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prosecute the country's most ambitious foreign-exchange fraud case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to date. Hill is alleged to have manipulated South Africa's dual</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">currency system with forged Eskom bond certificates, earning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">himself at least R100-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He fled to London in 1987 to evade the charges and spent the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">next nine years in luxurious exile at 1 Belgravia Square. Hill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last year handed control of local financial magazine Finance Week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to former Financial Mail editor-at-large David Gleason for an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undisclosed sum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill still has a few legal avenues open which would allow him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to postpone his return. Despite the court denying him leave to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeal to the House of Lords, Hill can petition the house directly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the next 14 days - in the same way that South Africans can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">petition the state president if a judge denies them leave to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeal to the Appellate Division in Bloemfontein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If his direct petition fails, the British Home Secretary will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sign a certificate authorising his expulsion from Britain and Hill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be flown back to South Africa. Hill could also appeal against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this executive decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that fails, South African lawyers working on the case say he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could approach the European Court, but it is understood this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeal would not suspend the British ruling: Hill could be sent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">back to South Africa with his European appeal pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Hill's legal team have argued that the fraud charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relate to exchange control regulations, the breach of which is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an extraditable offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An associate of Oshy Tugendhaft, a senior partner at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg law firm Moss Morris, and Hill's longtime lawyer,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said that Hill would petition the House of Lords.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gun? Mungo Soggot reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE feud between Times Media Limited and former employee David</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason exploded into the public domain this week, as TML's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Day newspaper published long- rumoured allegations about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason's ethical behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper on Wednesday published a carefully worded but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wounding article alleging that Gleason had invited Rand Merchant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank (RMB) to encourage him to stop writing a series of critical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">articles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The articles, which Gleason wrote during his stint at TML's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial Mail, related to the RMB and to KwaZulu-Natal water</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">utility Umgeni Water, and provoked a full- scale investigation by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason allegedly told top RMB executives he would stop writing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">if the bank favoured mining house Randgold in a mooted deal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concerning Gold Fields of South Africa. He wrote a number of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">articles about Randgold for the Financial Mail, and often critical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">articles of Gold Fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason has personal friends and business associates on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randgold board, and refuses to confirm or deny that certain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randgold directors backed his sensational takeover of Finance Week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason and Financial Mail editor Nigel Bruce quit TML under a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cloud after Gleason bought Finance Week. Up to that point, they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had studiously denied such plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement by RMB executive Wendy Lucas- Bull about a meeting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with Gleason in Cape Town - in the Mail &amp; Guardian's possession -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">quotes Gleason as having said: &quot;As far as I am concerned, RMB</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pushing through the deal (with Randgold) will be enough of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">favour to me personally to stop writing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucas-Bull, who heads Business Against Crime, says Gleason</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opened the meeting with the statement: &quot;If it comes to it I will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deny that this discussion ever took place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement by RMB managing director Paul Harris says, &quot;He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Gleason) said he had damaging information about RMB that he could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continue to write for a long time, but that he would stop doing so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">if I ensured the Randgold deal went through. He said he did not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stand to gain personally from the deal but that he wanted the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transaction to take place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Day's decision to publish follows months of sniping</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between TML and Finance Week, and months of rumours about Gleason</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and RMB. Nigel Bruce claims the documents only came into TML's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possession last week when RMB handed them to his successor at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial Mail, Peter Bruce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this week's Finance Week, Bruce says RMB merely plotted to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discredit Gleason for his Umgeni Water articles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce threatened Business Day with an interdict on Monday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">night, but had not taken any legal action at the time of going to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">press. A junior Business Day journalist read the article to Bruce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before it was published.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Week retaliated this week with a lengthy article</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">entitled &quot;RMB's vendetta&quot;. The article focuses mainly on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">background to Gleason's articles about RMB and skirts the ethics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">issue. It says: &quot;RMB has not been able to establish a motive for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason's alleged blackmail. There is no suggestion that he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">received any money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It adds: &quot;The bank ... chose neither to sue for the defamation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it alleges nor to bring a charge for 'blackmail'. Gleason denies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he made the threats attributed to him separately by Harris and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucas-Bull, and has refused invitations to justify his alleged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remarks in the face of a threat of legal proceedings ... This is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sordid matter which neither Gleason nor Bruce would wish to bring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into the public domain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correspondence on the matter last year between RMB, Roy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paulson, then Times Media managing director, and Bruce includes a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">letter from RMB's Harris to Bruce which states: &quot;To allege before</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">getting an explanation from Gleason that Wendy Lucas- Bull and I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">made up the story in order to intimidate Gleason is insulting to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">us. If we were this dishonest we would surely have considered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accepting his proposal. There is absolutely no doubt in our minds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what proposal Gleason put to us and he should confirm it with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris says in another note to Bruce that Gleason's allegation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that Lucas-Bull and Harris &quot;fabricated the story and have lied to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">our lawyers ... is as grave as the original blackmail issue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharon Wapnik of Johannesburg law firm Moss Morris - who also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">handles legal work for former Finance Week owner Oliver Hill - was</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - WHEN Chante Griffin was born in jail six months</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ago with a heart defect, doctors said she needed to be examined at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">least once a week. Her mother, Malina Griffin, says she has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seen only once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin, who is awaiting trial in Diepkloof prison, says she is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being victimised by a warder whose relative was allegedly killed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by her ex-boyfriend. She says Chante is being denied proper</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">medical attention because of the vendetta and she could develop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heart problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elmarie Eygelaar, head of the women's section of the prison,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says a doctor is in attendance every day and Griffin is free to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ask if she thinks her baby needs to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Griffin (30) says the lack of care for her child is not her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only problem with prison authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin has been in Diepkloof since last April, when she was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arrested in connection with a murder and hijacking. For several</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">months her lawyer convinced her she was being held because she was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to be used as a state witness. Recently the attorney general</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decided she would be charged with murder and hijacking. Her trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been set for October 24, meaning she will have been in prison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for a year and a half awaiting trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months now she has been battling to be moved to police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cells or to another prison, to escape what she says is abuse by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other inmates set loose on her by the vindictive warder. She says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">threats have also been made against Chante.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her requests, through her attorney, Pieter Scholtz, have gone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unanswered. Scholtz, hired by the public defender, told the Mail &amp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian he has not taken up Griffin's complaints with the prison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because they were &quot;unsubstantiated&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first attack was in August, by nine prisoners. After that,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin says, she was moved to a cell on her own. Then in October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some of the same inmates smashed her knee cap. After every</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beating, Griffin says, she was warned to say she had fallen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eygelaar said she was not aware of the attacks. She was also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unaware that Griffin wanted to be transferred, and promised to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to her woes, Griffin learnt last week that she faces</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">another 10 months in prison, and that she will be prosecuted with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenneth Fereira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin knew Fereira as Norman Wayne Posthumus, an alias he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">used. She was with him on April 21 1996 when he allegedly hijacked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a car in Brakpan and shot its owner. Fereira, who is also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">represented by Scholtz, has pleaded guilty to all charges , but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin insists she was a helpless bystander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after she arrived at prison, she learnt that the victim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was the uncle of the warder. &quot;I'm so afraid of what might happen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to us. They (some inmates) have beaten me up and they keep telling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">me they will kill my baby because my ex-boyfriend killed the uncle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the sergeant,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Institute for Crime Prevention and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rehabilitation of Offenders (Nicro) has expressed outrage at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin's treatment by her lawyer, the prison service and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicro's Ellie Maas-Weisenberger said Scholtz has neglected his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">client. Griffin says the lawyer has not visited her in prison, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has only met her briefly during court hearings for bail and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maas-Weisenberger also criticised the justice system for taking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;such a long time&quot; to decide whether to prosecute Griffin or use</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her as a witness. She called for the attorney general to review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selby Baqwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his damning report last May, Baqwa laid much of the blame on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hugo Badenhorst, the chief director of departmental services, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny Angelo, chair of the departmental tender committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Shisana said the departmental investigation into the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">actions of four officials - Badenhorst, Angelo and two unnamed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials - cleared three of them of misconduct. The fourth &quot;has</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She declined to give names, though Baqwa's report pointed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angelo as the one who had signed a note which led Shisana to</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prevent future Sarafinas, including appointing three senior</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the legal section, SA Ramasala, whose inexperience,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adviser from the Ministry of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shisana's report remains vague on how much the department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recovered of the more than R10-million paid to Committed Artists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before the contract was cancelled last June. It states: &quot;All</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">assets remaining under the control of Committed Artists have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">repossessed, with the exception of furniture and equipment which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was the subject of a legal claim.&quot; The report does not mention how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">much those assets are worth, or how much more can be recovered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A RASTAFARIAN is taking the Law Society of Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town to court over its refusal to allow him to qualify as a lawyer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because he has a criminal record for cannabis possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Law Society says it cannot allow Garreth Prince, who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">completed his legal studies at the University of the Western Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in 1995, to apply for a clerkship because he is not &quot;a fit and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proper person to represent the legal fraternity&quot;. Prince was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">convicted of possessing cannabis in 1989 and 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince says he has told his attorneys to take the matter to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law Society director Susan McElvaine says Prince was turned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">down because of the Attorneys Act, which stipulates that a person</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with a criminal record cannot register as a candidate attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Prince says the Law Society has allowed others with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">criminal records to register -- a point confirmed by members of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the legal profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince adds that under the religious freedom provision in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">new constitution he should have the right to smoke cannabis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Ethiopia cannabis is recognised in their official church as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a holy sacrament,&quot; he says. &quot;If they can allow it, surely our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitution should allow the same situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cannabis has never hurt anyone,&quot; he adds. &quot;It is a holy weed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and part of Jah's gifts. I completed my legal studies in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">required amount of years while I smoked it often, which shows that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it does not harm your brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he will take his case as far as the Constitutional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court if necessary, to fight for the right of the entire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rastafarian community in South Africa to &quot;smoke the holy weed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">openly . Ultimately I feel I shouldn't be labelled a criminal for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doing something that is religious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Cape Town constitutional lawyer, who declines to be named,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says the new Constitution probably does allow smoking cannabis for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">religious purposes, but not for any other reason.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - TWO of Johannesburg's elite schools went head-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to-head this week, not on the playing field but in the somewhat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seedier surrounds of the Randburg Magistrate's Court, to settle a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">case of assault, with racial overtones and a sporting twist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case stemmed from a fight at the Randburg Waterfront last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year between two students, one from St Stithians in Randburg, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other from King EdwardVII High School (KES) in Houghton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight left the St Stithians schoolboy with a broken jaw,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the KES boy badly bruised. The whole affair probably would</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have passed into school history, except that the St Stithians boy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">laid a charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against the KES boy who broke his jaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When others got involved in the m-l'e, a second KES student was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">verbally assaulted with the words, &quot;There are lots of blacks in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the world, but you will always be a kaffir.&quot; But it was not a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">factor in the court case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headmasters from both schools -Bruce McMurray of KES and David</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilde of St Stithians -- say the two schools enjoy a good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relationship and that the fight had nothing to do with inter-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">school rivalry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the court heard evidence that long- standing rugby and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sporting rivalry between the two English-speaking schools could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have triggered and fuelled the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boys involved cannot be named because they are under 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was held in camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources involved in the case say the two students crossed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">swords at the Flames Restaurant at the Randburg Waterfront. Asked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the owner to fight it out off the premises, they arranged a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">showdown elsewhere on the Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crowd of about 30, representing both the schools, gathered to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">watch, and on occasion, join in as the two students punched,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">kicked, engaged in head locks and slammed one another's faces into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the concrete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verbal assault came as a black friend of the KES boy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stepped in, prompting another St Stithians boy to utter the racist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two primary opponents were more subdued for their recent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">court appearance. Each was clad in his school blazer and tie, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was accompanied by his father</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus of the case was to examine a parting kick the boy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from KES dealt to his St Stithians opponent, which struck the boy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the face and broke his jaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides agreed on the facts -which emerged in statements and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">under cross- examination - but disagreed about what the KES boy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had intended with the final kick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His defence was that he had not intentionally aimed for his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opponent's face, and could not have aimed because he was being</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attacked from behind and it was dark. The St Stithians boy argued</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the kick had been intentional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end the magistrate ruled that the kick had hit its mark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accidentally. He acquitted the boy of the assault charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the case came to a sporting conclusion as boys from both</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sides - and their fathers -shook hands following the ruling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A fund set up to encourage banks to finance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">housing in high-risk areas has not been used, reports Mungo Soggot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE government agency set up to entice banks into lending money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for housing in high-risk areas has concentrated on areas where it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">admits there is no risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its two years of existence, the Mortgage Indemnity Fund has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not used a cent of the R300-million budget it was given by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government to insure banks against loan defaulting in high-risk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main reason the money remains untouched is that the banks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fund has been working with are operating in areas where there</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is little to no risk that homeowners will default on their loans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fund chief Nkukuleko Sowazi says banks should have been lending in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many of these areas all along, adding their policy of redlining</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had been made &quot;willy nilly'' and without thorough research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sowazi rejected suggestions that the fund was being too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cautious in its attempts to draw banks into black areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Housing Minister Sankie Mthembi-Nkondo says in fact that non-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">use of the fund is an indicator of its success. Its record, she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says, &quot;breaks the myth that this market cannot pay&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fund has to be cautious,&quot; she adds. &quot;It should not be seen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to be grabbing money.&quot; The fund is to be shut down in May, though</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">she hopes to extend its life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund was set up in 1995 as a mechanism to persuade banks to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">approve bonds for houses in what have been considered no-go areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refusal by banks to approve bonds for housing in risky areas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been a key stumbling block to the government's housing drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund has provided indemnity cover to 469 previously</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">redlined areas, resulting in the approval by banks of 91 000 bonds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">worth a total of R6-billion. Sowazi says the fund has also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">blacklisted 65 areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund has a contract with a private company, Social Surveys,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to determine an area's risk before deciding whether to offer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cover. Communities that have been blacklisted are welcome to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeal, Sowazi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian reported last week that the fund had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">angered residents in Meadowlands, Soweto, who say the fund</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">blacklisted an entire zone of Meadowlands because some of its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">residents had been involved in a five-year dispute with three</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute - with ABSA, Perm and Standard Bank - is about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">poor construction of their R60 000 homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents say the banks bear some of the responsibility for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">granting loans for houses they knew were not going to last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite their unhappiness, the residents have continued to pay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they discovered last month that they had been officially</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">redlined the residents complained to the provincial government,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">saying fund official Tlhoriso Thelejane had told them the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">redlining was to pressure the community to stop its &quot;bad apples&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from complaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thelejane initially said his comments were taken out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">context. Sowazi says Thelejane denies saying any of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sowazi also dismisses any suggestion that the fund colluded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the banks to redline the area, though he said the dispute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">probably did affect the area's risk rating.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parry was particularly concerned about the prospects of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">escalating violence, driven by addiction to drugs that are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expensive and hard to get. Also, latest arrest figures suggest</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Inkatha Freedom Party says it has no links with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controversial Church of Scientology. The partywas responding to an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">article in the M&amp;G last week which noted the receipt of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientology medal by Lawrence Anthony, who is a confidant of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mangosuthu Buthelezi and an associate of Scientology church</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP MP Inka Mars said the party had broken all ties with Murray</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after it had &quot;verified the facts&quot; of a November 1994 M&amp;G article</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alfred Moleah. Moleah was suspended by a unanimous decision of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the university's council when he failed to attend a council</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moleah was suspended for, among other reasons, making</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moleah, who spent 31 years in the United States before his</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Gauteng health department will implement a new hospital</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">numerous issues. Eric Buch, deputy superintendent general of</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buch said unions needed more time to study the proposals, which</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unions object to the department's proposal to retrench nursing</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health department representative Jo-Anne Collinge said the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE government is to investigate importing Cuban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">teachers to shore up the state school service. Education Minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibusiso Bengu said this week he planned to go to Cuba later this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">month to look at the country's maths and science teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed suggestions that the government's redeployment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">programme - where state teachers were offered new posts or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">retrenchment packages in a drive to equalise resources - had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">robbed the service of its best staff.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cuban initiative instead was targeting South Africa's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expected teaching needs over the next eight years, Bengu claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuba would qualify in the areas of education because they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">produced mass teachers and mass scientists,&quot; he told the Mail &amp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That they succeeded in doing - so they do have surpluses, so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that is a factor we would want to look at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan follows a similar initiative by Health Minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkosazana Zuma, who has drafted in hundreds of Cuban doctors to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fill gaps in poorer provinces' health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teaching unions have warned that the redeployment programme,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">initiated last year, has led merely to thousands of the most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">senior, experienced teachers leaving the profession. Bengu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conceded last month that the programme had weak points. But he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countered the statement this week that there was no scientific</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proof that expertise had been lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bengu also announced this week that he had secured R4,88-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">billion in government subsidies for tertiary education for the new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">financial year - higher than the figure originally agreed with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finance ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous budget would have forced cuts in subsidies to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tertiary education - a threat which prompted recent widespread</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">campus protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that subsidies for universities would stay the same as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last year, except for the five homeland universities whose</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">subsidies would be reduced slightly to the bring them into the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">line with the other tertiary institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Stuart Hess and Mungo Soggot finally got to see</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the report that caused all the trouble</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE dossier which prompted a government inquiry into rugby and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this week's high court battle between rugby supremo Louis Luyt and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports Minister Steve Tshwete contains little more than press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">clippings and court papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents handed to Tshwete by former Transvaal Rugby Football</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union vice- president Brian van Rooyen appear unlikely to trigger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luyt's downfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the 500-page dossier does contain the top-secret</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agreement spelling out the South African Rugby Football Union's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Sarfu) relationship with marketing company Megapro Marketing - a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">company allegedly linked to Luyt - in which Megapro's commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can be up to 25% of Sarfu's revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement, signed in June 1993, says: &quot;The trust hereby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grants Megapro the right to commercially exploit for and on behalf</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the trust all rights held by the trust with regard to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">marketing of the activities of the national teams.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the five-year deal expires, Megapro has the option to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">renew it for another two years. The document also spells out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Megapro's lucrative commission arrangements. It says: &quot;Megapro</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shall be responsible for the collection of all money due as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">result of their marketing activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luyt was only given a copy of the documents on Wednesday,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">following an urgent application to the Pretoria High Court by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarfu and the Transvaal Rugby Union. Tshwete had previously</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refused Luyt's demands for a copy, arguing that the contents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should remain under wraps until the ministry checked the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A task team, headed by sports director general Mthobi Tyamzashe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and including tax guru Michael Katz and former judge Mervyn King,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been established to go through the document. A full-blown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission of inquiry into rugby's affairs hinges on the team's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarfu's annual accounts for the 12 months to September 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">show it paid R3,5-million to Communication Services International</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- apparently a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a commission for the R2-billion Sanzar deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanzar deal was concluded between Luyt and Murdoch in 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and gave Murdoch exclusive television rights to all rugby matches</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the Southern Hemisphere for the next 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration and finance general manager Ivor Bloom said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarfu paid nearly R500 000 in commission to Megapro for other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sponsorships that were arranged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accounts also show that Sarfu spent close to R60-million on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">golden handcuffs which locked national and provincial squad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">members into three-year contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than R33-million was paid to the provinces following the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanzar deal to enable them to contract provincial players for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">three years - until 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another R26,7-million paid to the national squad bought squad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">members' loyalties for three years in the face of Australian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">magnate Kerry Packer's attempts to lure them to his World Rugby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarfu's profit for the year was R18,6- million, which meant it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had to dip into its reserves - income accumulated over years - to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fund the loyalty payouts, which drained the reserves to less than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R6-million, from a previous R20,6-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the organisation, which does not pay corporate tax because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it is supposed to be a non-profit organisation, underpinned its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">figures by claiming nearly R2-million in VAT rebates on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">payments to the provinces and its payments from sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It claimed R4,5-million in VAT rebates from the Receiver of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revenue in 1995, including rebates on the Rugby World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents of a Sarfu meeting last year which were leaked to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">papers last week showed Luyt's son, Louis Luyt Junior, stands to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">earn 10% commission on sponsorship deals he negotiates for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of these deals include Luyt Junior allegedly negotiating to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">take the South African team to Disney World toward the end of this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year - a deal thought to be worth R44-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal would include the South African national team playing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other international sides at Disney World's new sports complex in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orlando, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sarfu said this week that the decision to pay Luyt Junior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission is supported by its executive. &quot;Why should we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discriminate against any person who is successful in securing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">funds for Sarfu through sponsorships?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Or is there a problem, merely because it happens to be Mr Luyt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junior?&quot; executive member Tobie Titus said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luyt Senior, meanwhile, has threatened to sue the Sunday Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after it published details of the commission last week, and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">alleged involvement of other Luyt family members in South African</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - LEADING music concert promoter Attie van Wyk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said this week he wants to bring international actors to South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa in an effort to rejuvenate the country's languishing</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past few years South Africa has opened up to pop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">music and to sport ... I see no reason why the same can't happen</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">back to the theatre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African theatre audiences have dwindled in recent years,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and both he and Van Wyk are convinced the only way they can stop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the rot is to attract the superstar theatre names to the country -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">particularly the movie actors who frequently return to the West</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">End or Broadway to fulfil their love for the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Wyk has been responsible for bringing 40 international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">artists to South Africa, including Tina Turner, Whitney Houston</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Phil Collins. He plans to bring in Michael Jackson later this</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An assortment of weapons and vehicles is missing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'out of stock' from one of the Western Cape's largest military</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bases, reports Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE than 100 firearms, including assault rifles, have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disappeared from one of the Western Cape's largest military bases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military documents handed to the Mail &amp; Guardian show the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Defence Force (SANDF) discovered last July that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the weapons were missing from the Youngsfield military base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military police are still trying to trace them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missing arms fuel fears that SANDF weapons are finding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their way into the hands of criminals. Allegations have also been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">made that such weapons often end up with militant rightwingers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a signal message, a secret military memo, drafted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by a Corporal CB Oerson and dated September 20 1996, weapons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">missing &quot;out of stock&quot; from the Western Province Maintenance Unit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">include 103 7,7mm rifles, seven R-1 rifles, five 5,56mm assault</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rifles, a 9mm pistol and a &quot;riot- type&quot; Beretta shotgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message also said a Land-Rover and truck were missing from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the unit. The Land- Rover was signed out to the army's auction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">centre in October 1995, but the centre had no record that it had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arrived, and refused to verify that it had been sent to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report from the commanding officer of the unit, Lieutenant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willem Theron, says the &quot;outstanding problem&quot; in his unit &quot;could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not be solved&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SANDF failed to respond to queries this week. But part of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its investigation involves pinning the blame on a Youngsfield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">staff sergeant who died in a car accident in November 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the missing arms connected to the dead man - Izak Brand -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do not correlate with those detailed in the signal message. Brand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been blamed for the disappearance of 51 rifles and an unknown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">amount of ammunition allegedly sold to people with Afrikaans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">surnames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major Johannes Theart, appointed to investigate irregularities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in weapon sales from Youngsfield, says in a report dated May 2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996 that &quot;large amounts of ammunition were sold. In some cases up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to 1 000 rounds were sold to one person during January 1995, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more later. No proof could be found that the money was paid. I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">phoned a few of the members to whom weapons and ammunition were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sold and they said that cash was handed to Brand and that they did</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not have receipts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Brand has received a letter of demand from the state</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attorney for R14 335 from her husband's estate to cover the cost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the missing arms and ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says Brand's former comrades claim he is being framed for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the missing arms, and she is refusing to pay. She is seeking more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">information from the SANDF about the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My husband gave his heart and soul to the army. He gave them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16 years of his life, neglecting his wife and family for them. But</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">today no one in the army will protect his memory,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has a letter from her husband's former commanding officer,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commander PR Botha, thanking her and her children for his</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">circumstances and he often has to work early and late hours and</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">valued member of this unit of whom you can be very proud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Brand said: &quot;I don't understand how he could be regarded</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Before the 1994 elections the IFP used</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taxpayers' money to train and arm a military force, writes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stefaans BrUmmer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANGOSUTHU BUTHELEZI and his Inkatha Freedom Party lieutenants</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operatives - hatched an elaborate plan before the 1994 elections</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to ensure the Zulu nationalist party had a military force able to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resist the incorporation of KwaZulu into an African National</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress- ruled South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviews with three agents directly involved in the operation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">show the KwaZulu government, of which Buthelezi was chief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">minister, used millions of rands of taxpayers' money between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 1993 and the eve of the elections in April 1994 to train</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- arguably illegally - a reserve of up to 8 000 paramilitary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed the Inkatha army was the subject of an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigation by the Investigative Task Unit which was recently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disbanded. The Transvaal attorney general is investigating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possible criminal charges in connection with the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of protestations from key IFP officials that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project had been privately funded, the KwaZulu-Natal auditor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">general pronounced last year that there had been about R6,7-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million &quot;unauthorised state expenditure&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are fears the warrior network is still partially intact</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">movement opts for a militaristic way of dealing with the ANC-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controlled central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final weeks before the elections, well over 1 000 of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trainees were temporarily incorporated into the now- disbanded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu Police (KZP), where they were allegedly to have formed the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">core of an unofficial army loyal to the self- governing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">territory's IFP rulers - despite objections from KZP commissioner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roy During that the appointment of the paramilitary fighters was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">irregular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The training coincided with the IFP's continued absence from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the multi-party negotiations at Kempton Park and refusal to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participate in the elections, a stand it reversed only a week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before voting started. During this time KwaZulu and Natal were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">engulfed in the worst political violence in recent history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence monitors say there were more deaths in KwaZulu-Natal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the time of the training. There were allegations that IFPSelf-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protection Unit (SPU)graduates were responsible for much of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mayhem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project blurred distinctions between the IFP's party-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political agenda, the then- KwaZulu government and the now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disbanded KZP. The top command of the old South African Police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(SAP), including then- commissioner Johan van der Merwe and his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deputy, Basie Smit, allegedly knew of and abetted the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has established that in mid-1993 an initial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attempt was made under IFP central committee member Walter Felgate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to revive the relatively uncoordinated and small-scale training of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP recruits that had been a feature of the regional conflict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">since the former South African Defence Force (SADF) extricated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">itself, in the early 1990s, from its covert training and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operational support of IFP warriors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affidavits from men who took part in the new training - and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">evidence from the trial of former Vlakplaas commander Eugene De</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kock - suggest these were follow-ups, although without clear SADF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">backing, to Operation Marion, the covert programme launched in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mid-1980s by the SADF Department of Military Intelligence to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">create an anti-ANC paramilitary bulwark for the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rightwing extremist former special forces soldier Willem Ratte</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was employed, under one Riaan van Rensburg, to do the actual</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">training at a farm in the old KaNgwane homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Felgate initiative fizzled out in December 1993 -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disowned by Buthelezi. Meanwhile, IFP legislator and former SAP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">security branch agent Philip Powell had become involved in a much</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more ambitious programme to train IFP SPUs in September or October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1993. Powell, who has also been connected by De Kock to the SADF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">front company Longreach, has been tipped to become MEC for safety</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and security in KwaZulu-Natal. Until April 1994 between 5 000 and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8 000 men and women were trained at Mlaba Camp near Ulundi (and to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a lesser extent at the nearby Emandleni-Matleng Camp).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the IFP and KwaZulu government claimed they would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deployed as defensive SPU members allowed under the National Peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accord, witness statements suggest instruction included offensive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tactics - including sabotage and ambushing. After the training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">courses, which lasted about six weeks, the recruits were sent to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their communities with instructions to train others and form SPUs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instructors included Powell as Mlaba camp commander, deputy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commander Thompson Xesibe and one M Twala - all three IFP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials. Xesibe had been prominent among the IFP recruits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trained during Operation Marion by the SADF in the Caprivi. As</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many as two dozen more Caprivi graduates, most or all of them by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">then KZP members, assisted in the training, suggesting a blurring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of responsibility between the KZP, the IFP and the KwaZulu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter De Kock and his crowd from the then- disbanded SAP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vlakplaas hitsquad: De Kock testified in his trial last year that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Powell's request he had obtained six truckloads of weaponry -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including explosives, ammunition, mortars and grenades - from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">state arms company Mechem in October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of this weaponry remains untraced, leading to fears that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some IFP trainees may still have access to it. A number of witness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statements say former Vlakplaas officer Nicolaas Vermeulen and a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">number of Vlakplaas askaris went to Mlaba, where they also helped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the training. Other evidence suggests a few rightwingers,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including Ratte, did the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final weeks before the elections, Buthelezi's cabinet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ordered that at least 1 000 of the trainees be incorporated into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the KZP as special constables. The incorporation was conceived by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell as a basis for an unofficial army, loyal to the KwaZulu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incorporation of the recruits into the KZN might have been a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ploy to bypass legal restrictions which prevented KwaZulu, like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other self-governing territories, from setting up its own army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell also feared the creation of a formal army could trigger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">armed intervention from the South African government. The KwaZulu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cabinet, worried that KwaZulu could meet a similar fate to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bophuthatswana, appears to have accepted Powell's plan lock, stock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and barrel on March 15 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, the IFP was still holding out against joining South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's first democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, the plan was in full swing. Application was made to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the KwaZulu Public Service Commission for the creation of 2 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">special constable posts. Press reports at the time show that KZP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Commissioner Sipho Mathe finalised a deal to collect 1 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LM4 rifles from the parastatal Eskom at a cost of R2,1-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arms deal collapsed two days later when an Eskom executive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chanced on Powell and others loading the weapons at an Eskom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">facility onto KZP lorries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Goldstone Commission subsequently found Eskom had not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officially sanctioned the deal - and that SAP commissioner General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johan van der Merwe had personally authorised a permit to make the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;export&quot; of the weapons to KwaZulu possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early April, Buthelezi instructed During to speed up the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">incorporation process - allegedly ordering him to accept all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">identified trainees into the KZP immediately, and that details</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">such as screening and further training could be done later. During</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is understood to have ignored the instruction, insisting that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">poorly trained recruits in the KZP could have serious implications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for his force .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFP plan came to an abrupt end on April 25 and 26, as the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">off at Mlaba and sent home. While the reason for the termination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is not clear, the IFP's decision a week earlier to join the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Running at altitude, South African athletes are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">going to struggle to beat the qualifying marks for the world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">championships</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AFRICA'S top athletes go to Potchefstroom's peculiarly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shaped Kenneth McArthur Oval this weekend knowing that a national</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">title along with a performance which betters Athletic South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's (ASA) qualifying standards will automatically gain them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">selection in the squad for August's world championships in Athens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend's South African track and field championships come</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a month earlier than usual this year. The move forward is to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provide more time to prepare properly for the world championships,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and although ASA will allow qualification until the end of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">season in April, those athletes who have recorded their marks by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this weekend will have nearly five months to lay the foundations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for Athens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the tightly packed stands around Potchefstroom's track</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provide for a great atmosphere it is surprising that it has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chosen as the venue for the world championships trials. As an</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">altitude venue (1 351m) ASA's reward for victory with a qualifying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mark is clearly discriminatory against the middle-distance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">athletes and race walkers. Even though ASA has indicated that it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will adjust accordingly for altitude in the explosive events,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there is no chance of anybody recording a qualifying mark in an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">event beyond 800m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just the Engen Grand Prix final in Cape Town on April 8</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remaining as a coastal event this season, ASA runs the risk of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sending an all-white team to Athens as nobody has yet qualified in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the middle- distances. Of course, it should be a mere formality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for Olympic silver medallist Hezekiel Sepeng to make the grade in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the 800m but should the wind blow on April 8 in Cape Town there is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">very little chance of any other black athletes joining him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, so far only six athletes have qualified for Athens and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with altitude conversions two of those fall away. Llewellyn</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herbert's 49.27 400m hurdles time in Pretoria equates to a 49.68</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at sea level while Johan Venter's 10.24 100m time - also in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria - converts to 10.33. Ironically both these conversions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are better than the IAAF's &quot;A&quot; standard but not the far more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stringent ASA standards - 49.30 and 10.25 respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even sprint queen Adri de Jongh loses her 22.82 200m qualifier</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Pretoria which falls eight hundredths of a second shy of ASA's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mark of 22.94 but comfortably inside the IAAF's 23.24. She at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">least has the consolation of making the cut with her best 400m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time of the season of 50.91 at the Test match in Pretoria. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conversion to 51.31 is still better than ASA's standard of 51.54.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other three qualifiers are Okkert Brits and Riaan Botha in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the pole vault and Burger Lambrechts in the shot put. The throws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and vertical jumps are not considered to have an advantage at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">altitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most South African competitors in the sprint events and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">horizontal jumps are unwilling to admit that altitude improves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their performances, scientific evidence - not to mention that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provided by the likes of Bob Beamon, Jim Hines, Lee Evans, Pietro</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mennea et al - suggests differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASA is therefore right to apply altitude conversion factors to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">qualifying marks in the interests of fairness but the middle-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distance athletes have still not had a fair bite at the cherry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because the IAAF doesn't allow qualifying marks which have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">converted down from altitude marks in the distance events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So although there will be some exciting contests in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potchefstroom over the weekend there are unlikely to be too many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">athletes who will qualify for Athens once the selectors have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finished with their calculators. In the 100m and 200m Western</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Province youngster Marcus la Grange will be out to usurp the more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seasoned reputations of Johan Venter and Shaun Powell. The men's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sprints are difficult races to call but if any of these athletes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">want to go to Greece they will have to dip under 10.14 in the 100m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and 20.36 in the 200m which is very fast sprinting by local</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 400m will also be a close race with Arnaud Malherbe the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">favourite to win but he will be pushed all the way by Liod</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgopeng, Hendrick Moganyetsi, Alfred Visagie and Herman de Jager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Llewellyn Herbert should win easily and he will be looking for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a time of 48.90, but among the women only Adri de Jongh looks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">capable of getting another qualifying time in the sprints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hezekiel Sepeng will race the 800m and he will hope to pull</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">training partners Johan Botha and Jurgens Kotze under the 1:45.60</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standard. Sepeng's main rival, Marius van Heerden, will race the 1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">500m after coming back from injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New national high jump record holder Gavin Lendes jumped 2.27m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Port Elizabeth last month and must improve by one centimetre to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">satisfy ASA. Discus throwers Frits Potgieter and Frantz Kruger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will have to improve their personal bests to reach the 62.50m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">qualifying distance while Philip Spies will need to have fully</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recovered from his back problems to go over 82.00m. ark in Port</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - OOPS! You're barely round the first circuit of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the interview and you're off the track already. All those good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intentions to steer a straight line along a route of technical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interrogation, bluffing furiously about gear shifts, aerodynamic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">force, fuel loads, go up in smoke as you give into temptation and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plough straight into the wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the Basil Fawlty syndrome, the twitch not to mention the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obvious. You can't help it, though. The only really interesting</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thing to ask a 21-year-old rather stern- faced German who's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scarcely out of short trousers, has never driven in a grand prix,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lives in the antiseptic world of Monaco, and has a personal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manager at his side to tend to his needs, is just how difficult it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be to become the best racing driver in the world when you're</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not even the best racing driver in your own household.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By far the biggest task Ralf Schumacher will face this weekend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and beyond is coping with the relentless fascination with his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">surname. Not only has he got the name, Schumacher junior has also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">got the same mannerisms, the same self-possessed, distant air, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">same pale blue-eyed, elongated features, the same everything in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fact - management team, fitness schedules, diet and, above all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">else, attitude. On the fast track to fame and glory, Ralf has all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the detached, contained, confident characteristics of his brother,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael, seven years his senior. Has Ralf, though, got his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ability?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the question which will taunt him throughout the season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's already shown that he can be testy when quizzed excessively</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the subject. As a result some have marked him down as a cold</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fish, a rather remote, humourless figure, too hard- nosed and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inscrutable by half. It's too easy (and too early) to snatch at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the stereotype. Even though there was a resigned slump of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shoulders when our interview veered towards the subject, there was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enough sensitivity and honesty in his responses to suggest that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his thought processes have not yet completely switched over to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">automatic, and begrudging, transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a positive side to being a Schumacher, for sure,&quot; he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said last week, idling away the time in the Jordan garage at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silverstone while the mechanics wrestled with the snag which had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">aborted the morning practice session. &quot;It brought me into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael's management team, where Willi Weber gave me an early</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chance to run in a good F3 team. Sponsors, too, probably came more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is a downside. I make a mistake, like all young</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drivers, and it's because I'm arrogant, because I think I can do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it all. Maybe some drivers think I got the rides because of who I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">am, not what I do. That's their view. For me, it's just not a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">problem. My name is Schumacher. In the end I am accepted because I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">am a racing driver, not because I have a good name.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His team boss, Eddie Jordan, an irrepressible Dubliner whose</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">patter, push, roguish charm and fast-talking ways capture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">perfectly the rock 'n roll, high-finance mix of the sport, rejects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any notion that he was drawn to the name rather than the driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing whatsoever to do with it,&quot; says Jordan. &quot;The name meant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nothing. The same as when Senna da Silva first arrived here in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1982. The same too with Damon Hill. They're guys who I fancied to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">go places. I don't see it as a gamble at all. Our best results</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have always come from younger drivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralf brings an enormous amount of speed with him. He has a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">long, long way to go before he gets anywhere near his brother's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">level. But all the evidence suggests that he has indeed got his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">talent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ralf Schumacher does not want to take part in the comparison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">game. It's a wise move. They are too far apart in age for there to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have been any significant sibling rivalry when growing up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want to prove that I am me, that's all,&quot; he says. &quot;But</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have no problem with Michael's status, that's for sure. He is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the best Formula One driver in the world. I would say that even if</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he were not my brother. It's obvious. My aim is not particularly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to beat him, nor to try and jump out of his shadow. I simply don't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have a problem with all that. My results will make me my own man</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or not. That's all I care about - good results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His results so far have been impressive, enough to have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attracted the eagle eye of Jordan, a man renowned along the pit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lane for his shrewd investments. Ralf Schumacher revved his way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through the traditional apprenticeship of karting. He won several</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">karting titles before making his F3 debut with the WTS team in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1993. As he himself admits, doors which other youngsters would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have had to take a crowbar and jemmy to, opened for him because of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995 he won the F3 World Final in Macau. He moved to the Far</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">East last year to compete for the Le Mans team in the All Nippon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F3000 championship, the demanding testing ground for all young</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wannabes. The Schumacher wannabe won the championship at his very</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To go to Japan and survive is some achievement,&quot; says Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To go there and win a race is unbelievable. To go there and win</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the title is unheard of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a guarded, prosaic, individual, is Ralf Schumacher, which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doesn't make him a bad man. &quot;No, I'm not at all romantic about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what I do,&quot; he says. &quot;It is my job to go fast, that is all. I'm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not too wound up about coming into Formula One. It's the same</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">experience as other forms of racing. You want to go quickly, that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is your only thought. It's just a job. There was a moment, though,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when I was testing and Michael was nearby and it suddenly sank in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that here we were, two brothers and yet among the very best in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">world. But I don't dwell on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comparison will stalk Ralf this season. It's unlikely to floor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">him. His entourage will see to that. So too will his brother. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">may well bridle at the incessant coupling of his name with that of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his illustrious elder. There is no question, however, of him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">denying his own past. Quite the opposite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael has helped me since I was young,&quot; says Ralf. &quot;He still</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the Grand Prix season opens in Melbourne on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday, Villeneuve has the hot car while frustrated Hill needs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heavenly help to defend the title</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT is at times such as this that grand prix teams, struggling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to make final preparations for the new season, remember 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigel Mansell had joined Ferrari and his chances of finishing the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first race seemed as unlikely as suggesting that Damon Hill,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">penniless at the time and without a decent drive in the junior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">formulae, would one day become world champion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mansell's Ferrari, sporting the revolutionary semi-automatic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gearbox which is now de rigueur in Formula One, could barely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manage a lap before breaking down. During the warm-up for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first race, in Rio de Janeiro, the Ferrari ground to a halt once</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more and Mansell booked himself on an early flight home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He missed his plane because, against all odds, he won. Hill</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would be delighted to offer his travel agent a similar excuse on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday in Melbourne once the dust has settled on the opening round</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the championship. The chances are, however, that he will make</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his flight with time to spare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve months ago, Hill was the only driver in the top six to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have stayed put, the rest having compromised their chances by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">swapping teams. Now it is Hill who is suffering the effects of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">upheaval after being rejected by Williams-Renault and finding a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">place at Arrows-Yamaha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill was impressed by the promise of this middle-order team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">once they had come under the authoritative command of Tom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walkinshaw Racing but, judging by the relentless sequence of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">problems - culminating in a structural failure during the final</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">test at Silverstone last Wednesday - the potential is long-term,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and a far cry from the consistency and competitiveness Hill had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been accustomed to during his four years with Williams. At this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rate of going, the reigning champion will be lucky if he finishes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Australian Grand Prix, never mind winning it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill's frustration had been exacerbated by the news pages of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the motor sport press as they carried weekly reports on the fast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lap times achieved by the latest Williams almost from the moment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it made its track debut. Whereas Hill's first outing, delayed by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two days, was a single lap in the dusk at Silverstone, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams was shown to the press in Didcot and, 48 hours later, was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shattering the unofficial lap record during the course of a 72-lap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">run in Barcelona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some respects, it is unfair to draw a comparison between the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two teams. There is much to be done at Arrows, and Walkinshaw will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">address the problems by employing a similar formula to his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">successful remedy five years ago at Benetton, but the immediate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shortcomings simply underscore the culture shock which Hill will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">probably have to endure throughout the 17-race season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it's too easy, then I'm really not interested,&quot; said Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I need to put myself under extreme pressure, because something</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seems to happen which takes me to another level. And every time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it's happened, and I've been under such pressure, I've driven like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've never driven before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who has witnessed Hill's fortitude during the past few</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years would agree but, equally, they would understand the degree</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of difficulty on this occasion when he damns the Arrows with faint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">praise by saying: &quot;The car's great, it's just a bit on the slow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It almost goes without saying that Hill's old firm are the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">favourites to win the drivers' championship and take the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constructors' title for a record ninth time. Jacques Villeneuve,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who finished a close second in the championship last year, is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ready to capitalise on the lessons learned during his first season</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and he should have the measure of Hill's replacement, Heinz-Harald</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frentzen. The former Sauber driver has the inherent speed but it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remains to be seen whether his suspect temperament can withstand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the demands of a team who go into every race expecting to win -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1997 will make or break Frentzen's reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three remarkable wins in a poor car last year, Michael</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schumacher has nothing to prove. The quality of racing this year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will depend on whether Ferrari give the former champion a decent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The early signs are that the 1997 model is better than last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year's - which is not saying much - and, even if Schumacher is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taking the fight to Williams, he may face stiffer opposition from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">within his own team now that Eddie Irvine has finally been allowed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to get some test mileage under his belt. Irvine has been the first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to recognise the impact made on Ferrari's haphazard technical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisation by the arrival of Ross Brawn, the placid Englishman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who helped bring Benetton and Schumacher two championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Benetton-Renault suffer even further now that Brawn has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">followed Schumacher to the Italian team? Probably not, because it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is difficult to sink any lower than failing to win a single race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as reigning world champions last year. Benetton put that down to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fact that their drivers, Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi, were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">settling in and ridding themselves of bad habits picked up while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">racing for Ferrari for a number of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a productive test campaign is anything to go by, the team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from Oxfordshire are now working as a very efficient unit. Berger,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the most experienced driver in the field, could be the dark horse,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">since this is possibly his last chance to win the championship. On</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a good day, Alesi is capable of beating Berger and matching</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schumacher, but only if he allows his head to rule his massive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If points were awarded for appearance, then McLaren-Mercedes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benz would be unopposed, the silver and grey colour scheme showing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">off the latest car to stunning effect. McLaren, also fast during</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">testing, are ready to win with two experienced and hungry drivers,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard. But exactly the same thing was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said this time last year, and the former champions went on to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finish their third season in succession without a victory and then</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lose their sponsor, Marlboro, thus ending a 23-year association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same applies to Jordan-Peugeot, the team who have led the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">second division for too long without making any impact on the top</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">four. Eddie Jordan has taken the biggest gamble of the lot by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">signing two young drivers at a time when he desperately needs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">someone with the experience of winning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan may find stiff competition from Ligier, the French team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">having been acquired by the former champion Alain Prost. Ligier's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">competitiveness will come not just from the powerful Mugen-Honda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">engine but, on occasions, from their Bridgestone tyres, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">therein lies the one factor which could make all of the foregoing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">look foolish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After four years as sole supplier in Formula One, Goodyear will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have competition from the Japanese tyre company. The problem is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that no one knows how competitive Bridgestone will be, least of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all Goodyear. Even if Bridgestone produce a tyre which is fast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">during the single qualifying session on Saturday afternoon, it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remains to be seen whether or not it is capable of withstanding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the abuse dealt out during the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is almost certain, however, that Bridgestone has a rain tyre</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which is superior to Goodyear's offering, in which case a wet race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will give teams such as Stewart-Ford and Lola-Ford, Ligier,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minardi-Hart and Arrows a performance advantage they might not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">otherwise have had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Damon Hill is seen looking to the heavens this season, it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be in search of divine intervention as his only hope.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - TO call Auckland awesome is akin to predicting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the onset of nightfall. It is on performance against the reigning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Super 12 champions - even without skipper Zinzan Brooke - that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other sides in the competition will be measured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, Helgard Muller's Free State will be awaiting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday's opening game of a crowded weekend programme of tri-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">national provincial series matches with some trepidation. They</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">face the prospect of a second home defeat inside a week in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opening Super 12 meetings after going down to Transvaal at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free State Stadium last Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, that said, in the Free State pattern, there remains much</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that is good about this country's rugby. They approach the game in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the knowledge that their reserves and resources are limited when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">measured against the other South African sides in the competition,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and lay what they have directly on the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against the might of Auckland, doubtless still smarting from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the last-minute Henry Tromp try that earned Northern Transvaal a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thrilling 40-40 draw at Loftus Versfeld last weekend, only the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">brave or the foolhardy would predict a win for the home side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free State run the ball willingly and scrum hard. But then so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do Auckland. The second of flyhalf Carlos Spencer's tries last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weekend demonstrated exactly that. They won the ball from a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turnover and then let it travel through the hands across the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">length of the field for seven points that never looked to be on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Northerns showed the grit to come back in that hugely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">physical second half and level the match in the dying seconds,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says much for the seeds of a revival of the province's fortunes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">under the guiding hand of Kitch Christie. There are still great</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gaps that the man who led this country to World Cup success has to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cement closed. Not least of these is the facility to think and act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">faster and to make the first-time tackles that really count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, following the player revolution which ousted coach John</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams and his assistant Eugene van As, there are all the signs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there that Northerns will soon be one of South Africa's rugby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">powerhouses again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They get the chance to prove it in Pretoria on Saturday against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queensland. The pride of Australia suffered the humiliation of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">going down in their opening match against the Brumbies of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian Capital Territories (ACT)last weekend. Queensland had a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">somewhat indifferent start to last year's campaign, but got better</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as the competition wore on. They represent a tough hurdle for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northerns and another gauge of upward progress in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Durban, Natal take on an injury-hit Otago team in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opening fixture at a time when the team who ended up as losing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finalists are reshaping their line-up, with Steve Atherton and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Allen now overseas and James Small a permanent resident in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town. Otago, who upset Natal last year, will be without the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">services of Josh Kronfeld, To'o Vaega, Stu Foster, Sion Culhane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and John Blaikie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the other game this weekend take on ACT at Ellis Park. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brumbies have proved one of the surprise packages of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tournament though meeting Transvaal on home soil should prove too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">much for them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africans needed to get just 79 runs with eight wickets in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hand on the final day to reach the 201 required for victory. South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa fell 52 runs short, and an expectant nation on the other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">side of the world shook their heads in utter bewilderment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The innings and 196-run defeat at the Wanderers is a far more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">complex and disappointing tale. In Bridgetown, the side was a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collection of raw players. Only Kepler Wessels had played Test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cricket and the West Indians had seldom surrendered a Test in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbados. There was also the small matter of batsmen of the class</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Des Haynes and Brian Lara, as well as a pace attack spearheaded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Courtney Walsh and Curtley Ambrose to consider as mitigating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">factors in defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the start of the long journey Wessels undertook to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">instil a fighting spirit in the South Africans and mould a team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that, while it may not have glittered with superstars all the way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through, played as a cohesive and intractable unit. More</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">importantly, the introvertedly dour and oft-maligned Wessels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">instilled in his side the twin cricketing virtues of application</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and concentration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was this ethos that Cronje adopted when his turn came as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">captain. On to this he grafted the lightness, attacking spirit and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sheer enjoyment of the world's most glorious game that seemed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be missing from the Wessels make-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a joyous mix. But, somewhere along the line, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understanding that playing the game at the top level is about hard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">graft - to return again to the Wessels philosophy - has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">diluted. At the Wanderers, this, more than anything else, showed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came strikingly home from the moment Hudson unthinkingly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sparred at the fourth ball he faced from Glenn McGrath and made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his way back to the pavilion without a run to South Africa's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGrath exploited the overcast conditions to the full, setting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the platform for the Australians in a devastating opening spell of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">three wickets for 10 runs in 10 overs. It was seam bowling out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the top drawer, a signal exercise in concentrated professionalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the light of subsequent play his contribution was somewhat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">diluted, but by gutting a suspect top order and leaving the home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">side reeling at 15 for three, the lanky McGrath all but won the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Test right there and then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also a performance that left an important question to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">answered. If the Wanderers pitch was so flat and lifeless - and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this factor cannot be disputed in good faith - how was it that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGrath and, in a supporting role, Jason Gillespie, were able to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exploit it and the collective might of Allan Donald, Shaun Pollock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Lance Klusener could not, except for isolated patches?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, it is also interesting to note that Aussie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">skipper Mark Taylor took his seamers on faith and kept an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attacking field of eight men in catching positions throughout the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">early part of a first day that always presaged South African ruin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the batsmen, only Cronje, still way off his best form, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the evergreen Dave Richardson made any real impression. Cronje,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the echoes of the Wessels work ethic doubtless ringing in his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ears, put his head down and worked at building some sort of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">batting phoenix from the ashes which lay about him. Richardson,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">helped by some heartwarming insolence from Paul Adams, gave what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he always has for his country ... everything he has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the rest, the South African batting faltered to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deceive. Daryll Cullinan, suffering the rush of blood that he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suffers from so often and offering a poor shot in the middle of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">real class stroke-making; Jacques Kallis, learning the painful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lesson that, against Test-class seam, cricket is indeed a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">physically hurtful game; and Shaun Pollock looking imperious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before letting the wilder part of his nature tempt him into an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">injudicious swish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also led to the cruel observation from one member of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crowd that if 100 runs is called a century, 10 runs should be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">called a Hudson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not a pretty sight. Neither, from a South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">perspective at least, was the third day after the home side had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">battled back to a position where they just might have climbed back</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into the match on day two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Australia ending their Saturday on 191 for four, the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African first innings total of 302 looked a touch more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">respectable. But then Sunday dawned and between them, Greg Blewett</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Steve Waugh began rewriting the Wanderers record books in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mammoth 385-run partnership that never even vaguely looked like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being troubled, let alone broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the comfort of retrospect, it poses another pertinent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">question for the South Africans. If Blewett and Waugh could bat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all day - and then some - on the Wanderers track, why could the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last six batsmen in the home side's second innings not last a full</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">session?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer to that is probably threefold. The first part of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">equation stems from the psychological battering that interminable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">days in the field with little if no reward engenders, the second,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the resurgence of the Shane Warne genius. But the third leg is by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">far the most worrying ... a lack of application that would never</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have been allowed to happen under a man such as Wessels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cannot have escaped the attention of the present side that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Atherton batted his dismal England side to a draw last season</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in somewhat similar circumstances. His 185 not out in that epic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stand with Jack Russell stood as the biggest total at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanderers until Blewett's 214 gave him the honour of being the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only double centurion on the country's premier ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It needed some of the grit that Atherton showed for South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa to make a fight of it. And yes, while the largely unloved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">England captain did not have to fend off Warne's genius for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">producing the unplayable, he went out and did a job of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warne is an exceptional bowler and it is to be celebrated that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he has found himself again following surgery which seemed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">curtail his wiles of late. For, while the way he and fellow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spinner Michael Bevan wrought havoc on the morning of the final</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">day could hardly have been greeted with much enthusiasm in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African dressing-room, cricket in general needs the beacon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of genius to light it now more than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Adams we have a spinner who bowled well, but hardly as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">penetratively as Warne or Bevan. But such is the nature of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">buzzy youngster from the Cape Flats that he will have learnt some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">important lessons from the Australians in general, and Warne in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">particular, about the craft of bowling at this level</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kallis, another of the emergent young brigade, will have also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taken home some revision work. He learnt in the first innings that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the body is a bigger - and more painful - target than the wickets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second, he will have discovered that there is peril in not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">watching a Warne delivery every last centimetre of its tricky</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trajectory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both examples given are just two of many throughout the course</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the match that illustrate the chasm that exists between the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">application of the Australians and the lack of it from their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beaten opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is much work to do for the South African side before the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">second Test starts at St George's Park in Port Elizabeth next</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weekend. Perhaps even on the local variation of the rain dance,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for even the storm Cronje and company must have been praying so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fervently for, arrived a day late.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Try these PCReview books, writes BARBARA LUDMAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE boffins who write the Mail &amp; Guardian's PCReview supplement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have now turned out an entertaining series of guides to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">computer age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First up is Irwin Manoim's Buying the Right Computer (R49,95);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">next comes Mish Middelmann's The Lowdown on Windows 95 (R54,95);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and then one moves to Arthur Goldstuck's The SA Internet Services</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Directory (R44,95). Still to come: Gus Silber on software for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manoim, editorial director of the daily Electronic Mail &amp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian - Africa's first electronic newspaper - set up the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">world's first commercial newspaper produced entirely by desk-top</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">publishing when he and Anton Harber founded The Weekly Mail in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that Manoim knew what he was doing. &quot;When I bought my first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">computer,&quot; he confesses in the book, &quot;I was delighted by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">magnificent price I'd clinched, over a thousand rands cheaper than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the identical machine from a store down the road. I was lugging my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">boxes to the car boot when a thought struck me: 'Where's the box</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the monitor?' 'Oh,' said the dealer, 'the monitor is never</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">included in the price.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many years later, the monitor is still often not included in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the price ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manoim first saw a monitor - that's the bit with the screen -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the Sunday Times in 1977, where he was supporting himself as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">low-ranking sub-editor while trying to finish a master's thesis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they introduced computers to the Sunday Times there was a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">horrified reaction. They made everyone go on a course with an exam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the end and said anyone who failed would be fired.&quot; Manoim was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the only sub who took this idle, obviously jocular threat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seriously, and the only one who passed. So, he - a 23-year-old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">junior in a sea of men whose ages ranged from 50 to 70 - was the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only one who got a computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result of the fact that I was the only one at the paper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who could use a computer, I rose at extraordinary speed because I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">became indispensable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The guide fits pretty well into the same category, for people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about to go boldly into a computer shop for the first time and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confront a 19-year-old computer salesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You think it's easy to buy a computer? &quot;It's not just a matter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of buying a brand name. You're buying a set of specifications, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that makes it tricky. You have to know a bit about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are quite a few simple guides to computers available,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but they invariably confuse simple with simpleton and are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">generally aimed at either children or retarded Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The target audience for his guide is &quot;people accustomed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reading long screeds in the Mail &amp; Guardian, people who manage to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hold down responsible jobs and bring up their children but are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frightened of video recorders or cellphones and, most of all,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">computers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's also aimed at people who can use a bit of humour in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lives. It's a very entertaining book, whether explaining how the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">microprocessor runs its kingdom from a palace that resembles a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">squashed matchbox, or advising readers on what kind of monitor to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">buy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the computer has been bought and the 19-year-old salesman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has talked you into a Windows 95 operating system, it's time for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Middelmann's book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Middelmann was a science teacher once upon a time and knows how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to explain arcane but vital concepts. Founder and director of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Praxis Computing, he's an expert on networking, ie getting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">computers in an office to talk to one another. And he's got a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">radio programme on computers on Johannesburg's Radio 702.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also masquerades as Dr Byte in PCReview, responding to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agonised queries of readers whose operating systems have seized up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- or, lately, readers who have bought Windows 95 and can't for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">life of them get it to work. Thus the book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copiously illustrated with pictures of screens, command fields</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and other bits you have to see to understand, the book takes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ordinary computer users step-by-step through the system, from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">setting the date to choosing the right options; which add- ons are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">worthwhile and which you should avoid; those updates that have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been making internet connections and e-mail work much better; how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">much disk space you should leave free so the system has room to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are zillions of choices for everything. I've picked the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ones that work,&quot; says Middelmann, thus saving the reader time and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frustration. &quot;The main thing is to get control of your computer,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rather than to have it control you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're looking to take off into cyberspace and want to find</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a company to help you design a Web page, provide a link- up to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">internet, train you or your staff; if you're looking for an</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - CHILDREN OF THE DIASPORA AND OTHER STORIES OF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXILE by Mbulelo Vizikhungo Mzamane (Vivlia, R42,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NAKED SONG AND OTHER STORIES by Mandla Langa (David Philip,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R59,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBULELO MZAMANE'S title for his collection cues us in - his are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">largely stories that look back to the days of the struggle, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">most are set in the countries of exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandla Langa's stories take us up to the present (up indeed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the president's prostate operation); his first-person narrators</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">take note of the amaGents in their gravymobiles; they comment,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">too, on how easy it is to throw stones at the new democracy. Yet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all his stories dive back continually, imperatively, to the years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exile, as Mzamane records, is times of fear and anxiety, jaw-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">locking boredom, frustration at the stalling of the struggle, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">internecine squabbling with comrades. It is also unexpected</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">victories: in Welsh Interlude, the narrator achieves a union of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interests between Xhosa and (his hosts) the Welsh, both up against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the suffocation of their culture by the English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some readers these stories will not do what they want</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stories to do. Mzamane's writing is uncompromisingly didactic. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">places, his use of expository dialogue is hard to live with: it's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">easier to take an invisible narrator expounding political</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">realities - even if she or he's a bit stiff - than a pair of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wooden characters doing likewise. But to reject his didactic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">narrative technique out of hand (and some readers are likely to,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially given his priorities in truth-telling) would amount to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a sterile, narrowing view of what fiction can do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana Interlude, for example, is not so much a tale as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">space, sketchily defined, within which Mzamane can record material</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relating to the struggle: the lives of South Africans escaped to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana, one a Sowetan student, one an activist who has to flee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after spying, hidden in a dustbin, on Zulu hostel workers planning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What comes across, what Mzamane records for us, is the exiles'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dedication, tough realism, and great, if precarious, courage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mzamane's narrators speak directly of the past, as it happens;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langa's gaze back at the past. And &quot;no one can imagine what we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">went through&quot;, says one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The narrators of the stories in The Naked Song audibly grapple</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for an overview that eludes them. In The Dead Men Who Lost Their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bones, Clementine targets her telling on the question of how her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">father died, and in Chukwa a train of associations leads from an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">account of a drunkard father's love for his son to the drowning of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a wealthy British madwoman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here Langa's key witnesses confront not only the violence of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the state and of those who were/are its beneficiaries, but -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inextricable from this - the sense of a terrifying indeterminacy:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">life on a tightrope of razor-wire, above a barely measurable void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the struggle to get at least something of this across emerges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in stories that mostly dispense with tightly ordered narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the title of a story here doesn't necessarily tell you much</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about its contents or its intentions: the title here is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">starting-point for a string of fragmentary recognitions, from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lives that are prevented from adding up to more than the sum of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detail is harrowing enough (the bludgeoning to death by a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">farmer of a chicken thief, the hideous death of a boy working in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ship's engine-room in the Durban docks); the occasional statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of overview is gripping, and not unreasonable to read as spoken</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">straight by Lange - especially in the record of exile, which is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">packed with detail igniting with the sense it must be released (as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the stories of Mzamane).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langa does lighten up: A Gathering of Bald Men is charged with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suspense and surprise and is sharply, sourly funny. This is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">skill that Mzamane also has: when, in one story, newly conscripted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portuguese soldiers in Mozambique are ordered to shoot any</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">potential bearer of weapons, they find themselves confronted by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">old men and little boys - and, so, are confounded by &quot;the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">semiotics of age&quot;. (Still they start shooting.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might feel there is just too much packed into some of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stories in The Naked Song - but then Langa manages to communicate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with fierce intensity how it is all too much. Try There Are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virgins in the Township: I can't think of any story I have read</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for quite some time that culminates with such poignancy and such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">force.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">yourself tied in with Liberty's new range of Indian cushions,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reflects Talvin Singh with a grimace. Tabla player, DJ, club</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">promoter and now label boss, Singh is talking up his new</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(released by Omni/Mango Records in February), while talking down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its connections to the current upsurge of young Anglo-Asian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to understand Singh's concern. What with Kula Shaker</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turning Vedic chants into chart hits, Babylon Zoo's Jas Mann</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">becoming the first Indian in space, Birmingham's Bally Sagoo on</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">permeating pop culture in a way it hasn't since the Beatles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discovered kaftans and sitars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 27-year-old Singh, however, is wary of becoming part of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this season's novelty phenomenon. For one thing, he's a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">classically trained musician, having left his native Leytonstone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the age of 15 to spend two years studying in the Punjab. In the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years since, he's ducked and dived his way through bhangra, jazz,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hip-hop and Indian classical music, amassing an awesome list of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">playing credits en route. Among others, he's hammered his tablas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for Bj&quot;rk, Massive Attack, Courtney Pine and even the late</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American jazz giant Sun Ra, who dedicated a tune, Singh's Thing,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to his accompanist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jazz was an open door for me,&quot; he says, &quot;the only music that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowed me the freedom I wanted.&quot; These days, Singh finds his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">freedom in a giddy blend of Indian and Western influences in which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fizz and the boom of drum'n'bass collides with tabla</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">breakbeats and Indian raggas. Anokha, the club night he hosts at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London's Blue Note every Monday, has helped redefine Anglo- Asian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">identity with an aesthetic that is carried over to the Anokha</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">album, a compilation of names such as State of Bengal and Future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soundz of India. Singh's own album is also under construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People call the music that we make a fusion of several</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elements,&quot; says Singh, &quot;but as people we already are those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elements - we're already fused!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly the music on Anokha represents a leap forward from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the sometimes crude weld of Western rhythms and Eastern melodies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you find on the &quot;world rave&quot; circuit: a reflection, in part, of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Singh's knowledge of Indian tradition. For him, the East is a fact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of life rather than a piece of borrowed exotica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same, of course, is true for India itself, which has taken</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the new hybrids emerging from the old imperial homeland with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gusto that explains why major labels are now pricking up their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commercial ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A clear sign of shifting attitudes is that Amar, a 17-year-old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">female vocalist discovered in Southall by Singh and Bj&quot;rk, and who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sings the beguiling Jaan that opens Anokha, has just been snapped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up by Warners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've never wanted to make music whose only outlet would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through Asian shops,&quot; says Talvin Singh, &quot;or to be filed under</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">world music. &quot;I want to feel I could make an Indian classical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">record and have it in the pop section. I just want to be filed</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Indian film and music is reinventing itself,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">invading Western fashion and creating heated debate back home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOST in the West know little about Indian cinema, one of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">oldest, most varied, largest and most glamorous entertainment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industries in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conception is that there was Satyajit Ray, a great director</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of art movies like Pathar Panchali, and there is Indian popular</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cinema, which has absurd characters running round trees and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">singing of love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best, however, do not. Besides outstanding directors like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ray and his fellow Bengali, Ritwik Ghatak, throughout the history</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the Indian cinema there have been directors like Guru Dutt and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VS Shantaram, who have manipulated the commercial clich's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">differently, genuinely great stars to compare with those of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollywood, and playback singers and musicians, often classically</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trained, of real genius.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Hollywood, the golden age of Bollywood was during the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forties and Fifties. Now, however, a &quot;fusion&quot; is taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indian films with themes stolen from Hollywood are being made, in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an attempt to attract the new middle classes, who admire the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The music and song seem stranded in a limbo between Indian and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't necessarily a sad decline. It means that Indian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">movies are becoming technically more proficient and accurately</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reflect a rapidly changing and confused society, attracted to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West but determined to keep much of its own culture intact. A</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consequence of this is that, occasionally, a film comes along</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that, in attempting to break down barriers, offends officialdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such film was Shakur Kapur's The Bandit Queen, the story of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phoolan Devi, the most famous of Indian women outlaws. It dared to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">show the multiple rape she suffered at the hands of villagers who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resented her power, contained no songs and drove a coach and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">horses through the clich's of the bandit genre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After its success at Cannes, where it was bought for screening</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all over the world, the film was released in India to considerable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">acclaim. But not before there was a huge outcry, at first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">orchestrated by Devi herself, an influential political figure who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wanted her past forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there is another test case. Mira Nair's Kama Sutra, with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">screenplay by South African Helena Kriel, was rejected by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recent Indian International Film Festival at Trivandrum in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">southern state of Kerala. It was cut by the Indian censor- board</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and further shortened by India's supreme court, to which Nair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appealed. Scenes in which bare breasts and buttocks are seen must</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be reduced to seconds of screen time, and there can be no frontal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nudity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nair, who made Salaam Bombay, another great success at Cannes,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and then went to Hollywood to make Mississippi Masala, has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">directed a film based on the ancient classic stories, and claims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the intellectual community in Bombay and Delhi, where she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lives, have given the movie a &quot;heart-warming&quot; response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My film,&quot; she says, &quot;is to do more with sexual politics than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with sexual positions.&quot; But it's a title that comes with a lot of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">baggage. &quot;Television is full of foreign imports. And dozens of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">times you will see men and women dancing as if they were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">copulating. But we in India are brilliant at fixing things, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">how we fix sex is by cloaking it in song, dance and violence. Look</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the rape scenes in so many Indian commercial pictures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women are still supposed to be either virgins, good wives and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mothers, or whores. But they feel empowered by the film. It's the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">men who feel threatened.&quot; Another film, shown at the Trivandrum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Festival, though it almost caused a riot, was Deepa Mehta's Fire,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in which two married women become attracted to each other, largely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because of their boring husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no lesbians in India,&quot; wrote one journalist. &quot;Such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">things are merely a corruption of the West.&quot; Mehta, who lives in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada but made the film in India, otherwise got a good reception,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">though assailed by questions about her own sexuality by an avid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a par with the excitement over Kama Sutra or Fire is the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fact that the tax authorities last month began their largest ever</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">probe into tax evasion by some of Bollywood's biggest stars. Just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before Christmas, 15 superstars had their offices raided, as did</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">producers, directors, singers and even stuntmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What with this and the new morality, Bollywood may never be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">quite the same again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THEATRE: Sifiso Maseko</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SALAELO MAREDI, resident director at the Market Theatre for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1997, says: &quot;I hope to make the Market more accessible to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">traditionally isolated persons. If I have my way, it will become</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">like a home to these people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His first production at the Market, Blackage, was inspired by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an article on corruption in the pension system. He has created a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">piece that protests against ill treatment of the elderly. A</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">humorous courtroom drama with the odd song and dance routine,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackage is there to stimulate debate, reflection - and provide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">entertainment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cast of 10, which includes Don Eric Mlangeni, Baby Cele and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arthur Molepe were hand picked by Maredi. &quot;Most importantly they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all share the vision of a 'Peoples' theatre',&quot; says Maredi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Blackage this vision gives voice to the treatment of senior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">citizens in the hands of unscrupulous state institutions. And</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">again Maredi reacts against the belief that a woman's place is in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the kitchen. How better to counter that view than to have an AK47-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">toting woman judge or doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essential to this new black age is tolerance. Though some ideas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the play counter traditional African conventions, they do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mark a loss of &quot;Africanness&quot;, but rather an affirmation of it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - @ FINE ART:Hazel Friedman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAST year's Unplugged exhibition will go down in South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">art history as a supreme example of the &quot;buddy system&quot; at its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">worst. Initiated by artist Kendell Geers as a riposte to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">traditional curatorial process - whereby the curator determines</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the content and presentation of an exhibition - Unplugged set</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">itself up as a transparent, democratic event with artists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">determining process and product via a nomination system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the chain letter principle got hopelessly lost in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">delivery. Unplugged II is a different beast, in part. Co-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ordinated by artist Malcolm Payne - who was last year chosen by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geers, (who was this year chosen by Payne), it has not attached</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">itself to a singular thematic peg. And like its precursor it has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not relied on curatorial intervention (which would have defeated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the aim of the exhibition). But unlike the artistic incest and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conceptual befuddlement that characterised much of the work on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last year's show, this exhibition has spread itself wider - in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">geographical sense, anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couplings are also not as predictable as in the previous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exhibition. For example, Minette Vari selected Siemon Allen from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban, who in turn chose fellow-Durbanite Aliza Levi. The fact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that Allen and Levi, along with Claudette Schreuders from Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town (chosen by the Cape's Lisa Brice), are regarded as three of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the names to watch on the contemporary art scene, perhaps means</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that future Unpluggeds will not remain confined within the cushy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ambit of Gauteng's traditional art cliquedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But breadth should not be confused with depth. In her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exploration of bodies prostrated in indeterminate spaces, Levi,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for example, displays little more than the degree to which she can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">integrate the styles of Jane Alexander and sculptor Wilma Cruise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she does this without the former's metaphoric richness and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gritty realism and the latter's monumentalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schreuders's Barbie and Ken sculptures easily achieve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;endearing&quot; status. Full of trendy tattoos, they are the 1990s</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mannequins for someone's mantelpiece. But that's about it. As for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peet Pienaar's contribution - a pair of found (as in bought) shoes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- it is irrefutably quaint and whimsical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Jeremy Wafer's quirky venture into the realm of op</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">art is both visually enticing and intellectually charged. A</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">triptych of glass paintings resembling black seed pods, or black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">holes, his work is at once archetypal and iconic; heraldic and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">metamorphic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willem Boshoff has also produced a compelling if slightly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cumbersome work. An epitaph of sorts to apartheid, it is called</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shredded Evidence and consists of a concrete poetry sculpture in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block form. Papered with 48 &quot;scrapped&quot; laws of apartheid - 1948</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was the year the National Party assumed power - it serves as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">monolithic monument to the attempted erasure of crimes committed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">under the guise of legality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Brand's equally monumental Do Earthlings Not Embrace Love</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provides a poignant indictment of war. It consists of three</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">figures of children constructed from metal and chipboard,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">haphazardly hung as though thrown into the air during an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">explosion. Initially their de- individualised, severed torsoes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could resemble uneven slabs of meat. Except for the fact that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brand has treated them as enlarged photocopies, photographs or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">freeze-framed documentary images. Up close, the forms are made up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of magnified dots, like photographic pixels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A semblance of coherence crumbles and details within the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seemingly amorphous mass are differentiated only by shadings of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">red to denote blood, and black for facial features. It is only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from a distance that their tragic humaness can be deciphered. And</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">most accusatory of all, perhaps, the forms have been bolted to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chipboard by screws bearing the name Denel - the company that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manufactures military equipment. Brand depicts the horror of war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and its victims without vulgar sensationalism, shock or schlock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tactics, but rather with an overwhelming sense of humanism and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">respect for his subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coincidentally, Geers has focused on a similar theme: violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and its relationship to art. But with a vastly different agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Called TW (title withheld) Rock (a throwback to the surrealist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">artist Magritte's Floating Rock) his work consists of a news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">insert detailing one of the most shameful episodes in the anti-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apartheid struggle: the necklacing of Maki Skosana in July 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was perpetrated by a frenzied mob in front of an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international audience and the footage was broadcast, at length,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on SABC as a propaganda triumph by the authorities at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geers has used the visual footage with a voice-track of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magritte talking about the ways in which two incongruous images</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">must find a way of reconciling. It's on sale for R1-million and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geers has offered the proceeds to the Truth and Reconcilation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geers has merely appropriated and decontextualised the brutal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sequence from its own history and directly transplanted it on to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">art, which in turn has been dislocated from its own history and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transposed on to life. The work offers no additional insights. Its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">role is little more than propagandist, echoing the truism that art</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is art and life is life. This, sadly, is art at its most soulless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the issue of appropriation, while white artists clearly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have no qualms about including what is essentially the history of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black South Africans in their work, they have not extended a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">similar courtesy to even one of the black contemporary artists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">working in South Africa to participate in this show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unplugged II will be more fondly remembered than its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">predecessor. But it might also be recalled as yet another example</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of artistic whitewashing with Made in the Old RSA stamped all over</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unplugged II is at the Rembrandt van Rijn Gallery in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg until March 15</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Catalyst Films is becoming the busiest and most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">respected production house in South Africa. ANDREW WORSDALE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN early 1986 Jeremy Nathan was doing his military service with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the film unit of the Entertainment Corp - a virtual propaganda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wing for the South African Defence Force. At night, though, he'd</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hang out with friends Matthew Krouse and Giulio Biccari,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">formulating De Voortrekkers, the subversive black and white short</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">film that took a Reichian view of South Africa's pioneer history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film incited near riots by right- wingers at the Limits of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberty Film Festival and was an insert in my own low- budget</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feature Shot Down - the first film Nathan produced (he even</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">managed to wangle his last month in the service off, to begin pre-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">production on the movie!).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a little over 10 years later and he has a pack of pictures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">behind him and is the head of a mini-empire of movie-making:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catalyst Films, one of the busiest production companies around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year it's producing nine short films ranging in length from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 minutes to half -an-hour; co-producing a feature; producing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more than six documentaries and has loads of projects in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After producing Shot Down, Nathan acted as the line producer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for Cedric Sundstrom's sleazy psycho-sexual thriller The Shadowed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mind, a film financed by tax-breaks that was largely written on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">set. It received some praise from cultists and after being banned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disappeared without a trace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that was 1988 and it was the end of the industry's free</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ride on the Receiver of Revenue. Nathan, an inveterate cinephile,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">moved on to developing several other local feature films. His</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plans ran aground due to lack of finance so he joined Afravision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(otherwise known as VNS) as a producer and made about 10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">documentaries, including the ANC history series Ulibambe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lingashoni (Hold up the Sun), and produced the controversial TV</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">series The Line, a production co-financed by ZDF and Channel Four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This project started his fruitful relationship with the United</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kingdom broadcaster and specifically its head of drama, David</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aukin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With South Africa's democratisation, VNS disbanded. &quot;Everyone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wanted to go in different directions and that's when I set up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catalyst,&quot; Nathan says. Operating alone and out of his flat in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troyeville, he managed to get several projects into development;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including the tale of Saartje Baartman, The Hottentot Venus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, instead of a two-roomed flat pungent with cat pee, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">company has offices, several computers, a switchboard and a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collection of people who help run the show. There's Nathan, Ethel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams-Abrahamse, Brenda Goldblatt and ex-stockbroker Ian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possibly the company's most exciting venture to date has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the co-production with Channel Four and Indra De Lanerolle's Xenos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Films of British director Les Blair's feature film Jump the Gun,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an improvisatory take on life in Jo'burg. The film recently played</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to a mixed-reception at the Berlin Film Festival. It's due for a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nationwide release of 20 prints and will play from inner-city</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cinemas to suburban mall arthouses later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even more enticing is Africa Dreaming, the six-part series</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of half-hour love stories that debuts on SABC1 in July this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea for the series came to Nathan and Zimbabwe-based producer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joel Phiri at the Rotterdam Film Festival in 1994. &quot;We just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thought: 'What can we do with all the producers we know in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rest of Africa?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result comprises The Last Picture from Zimbabwe, So Be It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from Senegal, The Black and the White from Tunisia, Mamlambo from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, The Gaze of the Stars from Mozambique and The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homecoming from Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madala Mphahlele of the SABC went for the project and put in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some development money then, with the help of the South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress of Directors (SACOD) and other industry players,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">workshops were held with screenwriter and teacher Jacques Akchoti</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where all the scripts were brainstormed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The SABC was the first to put its cock on the block,&quot; says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nathan, but the 15 different partners from Europe were among the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participants that came in to back the $900 000 for the three hours</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of finished product. With production starting in October 1995 and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finished by March 1996, the speed is nothing short of amazing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Catalyst has lots, lots more, including two 10-minute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shorts to be shot on 35mm, produced in association with Channel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four, part of a three-year series of short movies to be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company is also preparing a two-part series, also for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Channel Four, called Homecoming, about ex-Umkhonto weSizwe</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - A YOUNG playwright from Edenvale is currently earning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interest in the West End of London, Britain's theatreland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backpay, by 24-year-old Tamantha Hammerschlag, is being staged at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the illustrious Royal Court theatre, known for its pioneering of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">young talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hammerschlag is clearly delighted at having her work staged at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Royal Court. &quot;There is a really good feeling you get from</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">working there. The people at the venue have been very supportive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of me and my work,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backpay is set in contemporary South Africa and follows Mina, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white teenager, as she goes in search of Sophie, the black nanny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who looked after her when she was a small child. Through the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">characters, played by Britons, it charts the tensions raised in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the post-apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never had a figure like Sophie when I was growing up,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">someone who raised me, in the same way that Sophie did Mina,&quot; says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamantha. &quot;But we did have black maids. A lot of the play comes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from observation, as opposed to biographical experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She went to the Wits university and it was here that she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">started writing for the theatre. &quot;I always had my head in a book</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a child,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I have wide tastes. The things I wrote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at university were performed by the theatre groups there, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nothing professional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backpay is her first &quot;proper&quot; play and was written when she was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spending a year studying for her master of arts in drama in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London. &quot;All in all, it took about three months of serious writing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to finish it,&quot; she says. &quot;But obviously there were rewrites when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we started rehearsing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamantha received a favourable response within two months from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Court, the only venue she sent her completed piece to. &quot;My</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lecturer at college suggested the Royal Court and it paid off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dominic Tickell, who runs the Royal Court's Young People's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theatre, was impressed by Backpay when he read it. &quot;The play was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mature and courageous. She was not afraid for her characters to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a state of flux and for their circumstances to change,&quot; he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tickell reckons Hammerschlag has a bright future. &quot;I think she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is more promising than a lot of young playwrights we come into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contact with. She is serious about her work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The play was first seen as part of the theatre's Young</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Playwrights Festival last year and was revived for its West End</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">run, before going on to tour venues in the east of England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, Hammerschlag would like Backpay to be staged in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa. &quot;I've had preliminary talks but nothing concrete</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">yet,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is currently working on her second play but is reluctant to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discuss it. &quot;It is set in South Africa again. There have been so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many changes over the past few years that you can't help but be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">affected by what has gone on.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Exactly how much fuss can one naked man in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">jeans ad cause? Plenty, reports MARIA McCLOY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO adverts for Sissy Boy Jeans in the March editions of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosmopolitan and Elle magazines have resulted in a widespread</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media furore and caused several leading local chain stores to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remove the magazines from their shelves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What, can you see dick?&quot; asked one person when I mentioned the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">saga. Yes, the black and silver ad for Sissy Boy in Elle does</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feature a naked man - and yes, you can &quot;see dick&quot;, which has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">offended Checkers, Woolworths, OK and Pick 'n Pay. This, and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kama Sutra graphics in the Cosmo ad. Several of the stores said</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they had received customer complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad in Elle is a three-page spread paper - the one page is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">folded over and has a disclaimer in the corner warning: &quot;Do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turn this page if you find explicit material offensive.&quot; The sales</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">line reads: &quot;In South Africa there are over 30 men's magazines,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowing males to pore over sexually explicit pictures of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">females.&quot; Open the page and you see the naked model Philip</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McDonald, and the slogan: &quot;Well, two can play at that game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shona Bagley, Elle editor, believes it's each shop's right to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remove the magazines, &quot;but I'd prefer it if they gave their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">purchasers freedom of choice&quot;. She's disappointed by the shops'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">actions as she's had only three complaints among &quot;dozens&quot; of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">compliments from people who have said it was about time such an ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bagley had thought South African attitudes had evolved beyond</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this and says she accepted the ad because: &quot;Elle has a worldly,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enlightened readership that I believed would accept the ad in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spirit in which it was intended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have argued that the ads are not fit for children to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bagley stresses there was a disclaimer and a plastic band around</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the cover. &quot;Is it not time for a bit of gender quid pro quo? What</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">makes a naked female model more socially acceptable than her naked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">male counterpart? Who are the gatekeepers of supermarkets and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chainstores protecting here - women, children or male</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">vulnerabilities?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry Brewis, marketing executive at Woolworths, was one of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chainstore folk who describes theirs as a &quot;family store&quot;. He says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woolworths had received a number of public complaints. Cobie van</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dort, OK group promotions manager, says that pictures of people in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sexual positions would be seen by customers as &quot;objectionable&quot;. OK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is also planning to remove Directions magazine from its shelves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because of a feature on body- piercing showing a picture of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pierced penis - but, as a number of people pointed out, this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">picture hasn't caused nearly as much of a furore as the unviolated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">item.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Art director for the ad was Jupiter Drawing Room's Joanne</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas and copywriter was Noel Cottrel. Thomas says the campaigns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are intended to be tongue-in-cheek and depict women of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nineties &quot;as in control of what ever situation they may find</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">themselves in&quot;. She says the people who refused to stock the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">magazines are &quot;closed- minded&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jupiter Drawing Room MD Kevan Aspoas says he is thrilled with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the impact the ad has made. He dismissed the notion that the ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are pornographic, saying the model didn't have an erection and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the beautifully done ads are &quot;tastefully executed&quot;. He said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">calling these ads porn was akin to calling naked Roman statues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">porn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week The Star ran a story on the incident on its front</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">page, along with the naked picture. By the time the late edition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had come out the picture was gone. In an article the next day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editor Peter Sullivan said: &quot;The reaction it provoked suggested</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the decision to use it on the front page was inappropriate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and we bowed to public indignation by pulling the picture from our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">later editions ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like everyone involved in the campaign, Cosmopolitan editor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vanessa Raphaely was surprised by reactions to the ad. She says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">she's had both positive and negative feedback and that &quot;the last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thing we wanted was to offend people&quot;. She adds that the Kama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sutra has been a cultural icon for hundreds of years and is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">readily available in bookstores - and pointed out the irony that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this document was written by celibate monks. Though she did not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">personally see it as pornographic, &quot;I have to accept that what I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">think is not necessarily what other people think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year Cosmo ran a feature of naked male celebrities - but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their penises were covered - and she felt it would be hypocritical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to allow the nude ad to run when in that instance she'd not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowed full frontal naked males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johanna Pestana of The Advertising Standards Authority says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they've not received complaints about the naked man, but have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">registered seven written complaints about the Kama Sutra ad. And</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there have been people calling in with concerns that children are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being exposed and that the ad was insensitive to rape victims and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could spur potential rapists. There has to be a fair proportion of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">complaints (25% of readership) to have an agency withdraw a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">campaign. In terms of the letters written they've asked the ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agency to respond to the accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person who definitely doesn't agree that the ads are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">harmful or pornographic is the naked model. McDonald says:, &quot;I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">don't see why society should be embarrassed by a naked body.&quot; He's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had an &quot;extremely good&quot; reaction to the work, besides he wasn't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concerned by what reaction he'd get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He describes the concept as excellent, and has strong opinions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on a moralistic, closed-minded society, commenting that if it were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a naked woman there wouldn't have been a hullabaloo - in a sense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proving the ad's point. &quot;It'd be 'wow, check the chick out ... '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men would have been 100% happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what about the argument that the ad harms kids? Thomas says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the ad was done in such a way that if a child was to see it, it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would be no different to seeing their father or brother naked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, adds McDonald, people's attitudes have been borne out by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the dogma pumped into children that sex is bad and naughty - which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he thinks is what ends up giving people complexes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of Expression Institute chief Raymond Louw says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">retailers have the right to take such action when they think their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">customers may be offended, but adds that the reaction has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unsophisticated because of the bans and puritanical approach to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">art and pictures imposed by NP rule. &quot;People are too easily</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shocked by what could be regarded as reasonably normal elsewhere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every time they see a naked person they collapse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Notes from the Net</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOW is it that one of the smallest major newspapers in South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, namely the Mail &amp; Guardian, can boast the most popular</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">online publication on the African continent?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question comes with the release of audited figures that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">show more than 100 000 distinct visits to the site, and almost 300</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">000 distinct page requests. It is wonderful vindication of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">belief that the Web is a level playing field, where the size of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the site owner has no bearing on the success of a site. Right now,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the minnow in the print pond is the giant in the Web world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How exactly do Web sites measure their reader &quot;traffic&quot;? This</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">raises the ancient dilemma of statistics, damned statistics and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lies. That chestnut perfectly describes the world of Web hit-rate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there's not much that can be done about separating the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">damned from the clean statistic. But outright lies are a different</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">matter. Let me elaborate for a moment: let us say a Web site</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">records a million file requests in one month; that is the number</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of files, including both text and graphics (with every icon and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">button on every Web page counted as a hit), that has been called</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up over a month. This is &quot;statistics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It then tells all the world that it has had a million &quot;hits&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is &quot;damned statistics&quot;, since perhaps 90% of those &quot;hits&quot; are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">made up of extraneous material rather than distinct pages called</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up. Not a lie, but not a very clean figure either. And finally,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the claimant blurs the definitions, and gives the impression of &quot;a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million visitors to our site&quot;. That is plain old &quot;lies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's not much one can do about plain vanilla statistics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being used selectively enough to reveal only good or bad news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about the opposition. But a very powerful antidote has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">created for those &quot;damned statistics&quot; and &quot;lies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mainstream auditing firms have introduced Web auditing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">divisions to provide a formal measure of major sites' true usage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much like the All Media Product Survey forced newspapers to come</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">clean after 60 years of exaggerated readership claims, the Web</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">audit will force a level of honesty on Web site owners. Already,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(http://www.dtt.co.za/) Deloitte &amp; Touche is auditing the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electronic Mail &amp; Guardian (http://www.mg.co.za/mg), Business Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online (http://www.bday.co.za) and Business Times (http://www.bti</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mes.co.za) and is negotiating with The Independent Online</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(http://www.inc.co.za/).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coopers &amp; Lybrand (http://www.coopers.co.za/) is auditing Kevin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davie's Woza Internet (http://www.woza.co.za/) business news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">service. Of these, however, only the eM&amp;G and Woza have openly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">published audited Web figures, with the eM&amp;G reporting more than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">250 000 page requests in November, rising to the 300 000 mark in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January; while Woza, a more specialised and relatively new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">service, measured 38 000 distinct page requests in January. What</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is the crucial next step that Web auditing will force on the media</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seven new radio licences announced this week are set to breathe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">life and diversity into the airwaves. Allowing for specialist and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group interests, they avoided adding yet more pop music stations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to that over-tired parade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three FM stations in Gauteng went to Classic FM (classical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">music and jazz), Youth FM (black youth music station, 25% talk)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Khaya FM (formerly called Jozi Radio and aimed at the black</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Afrikaans talk station, Punt Op Mediumgolf, won MW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frequencies in Gauteng and Cape Town. Cape Talk (an English talk</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frequency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specific frequencies for each station are yet to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">determined, &quot;no later than the end of May&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Classic FM's ownership structure includes Disability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Empowerment Concerns with 10%; while Streetwise Children have 10%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Khaya FM. Radio P4 is 80% owned by Makana Trust, a consortium</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Argus 'mea culpa'Three former editors have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distanced themselves from the submission by Independent Newspapers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the truth commission, reports Jacquie Golding-Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EX-EDITORS of the former Argus Company, the new management at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Newspapers and journalists are involved in a heated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">debate regarding the Independent group's submission to the Truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an extraordinary move, three former Argus group editors have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distanced themselves from the report and challenged its contents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to The Sunday Independent they said they had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nothing to apologise for. In response, Cape Times editor Moegsien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams wrote a heart-rending open letter to John O'Malley, one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the three editors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Malley was the editor of the Daily News (1968-1977) and Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argus (1977-1982). The others were former Daily News (1977-1992)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Sunday Tribune editor-in-chief (1989- 1992) Michael Greene;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Sunday Tribune editor (1974-1989) Ian Wyllie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams notes &quot;with joy and disappointment&quot; the tack taken by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the editors, but goes on to relay a personal view of exactly how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it felt to be a black reporter in a white newsroom with a white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editor. &quot;A common feature we had to contend with as black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists was we were not fully trusted with the facts&quot;, says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams, recounting how badly one of his eye-witness account</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stories was handled by O'Malley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams expresses disappointment that the editors are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rejecting the &quot;humble apology&quot; offered by the Independent group,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and highlights many scenarios, including the fact that the truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seen through black eyes was often distorted to fit white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">perceptions and assuage the repressive government of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Malley argues that an apology is unnecessary: &quot;Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspapers, a foreign company, went ahead and made a submission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">without consulting us as editors during the era in question. It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was inappropriate for them to make a submission on our behalf,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially as we have nothing to apologise for,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former editor-in-chief of The Star (1974- 1990) Harvey Tyson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agrees. Interviewed on a non-attributable basis in the submission,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tyson says he chose not to associate himself with a company report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as he has &quot;absolutely nothing&quot; to apologise for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I am asked by the TRC to make a submission, I will be happy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to do so but what on earth do I have to apologise for? We should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be proud of what we achieved as the English press. We were the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">most consistent in our campaign against apartheid,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green argues that it is common knowledge that human rights were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">violated, but says the rights of the newspaper and its managers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were also violated with privacy being invaded via phone taps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last chair of the Argus Company (1990- 1994) before the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent's takeover, Doug Band, argues that the Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group should have embarked on a more &quot;thorough consultative&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">process before making the submission. However, Band says he is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposed to a case being presented to the TRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Cape Times (1971-1987) editor Tony Heard says the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">submission was a welcome step in the ongoing probe into the role</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of newspapers in a terrible era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although not consulted, Heard argues that the English press had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">failings and was more like a &quot;lightweight boxer&quot; who managed a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">couple of blows but nothing heavyweight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to most of the other editors, Heard more readily</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">admits that there were failings, adding that there should be a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;greater readiness by former editors to recognise that they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operated in a context of compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is time for a bit of humility and an apology especially</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when we all operated in a climate that neglected black reporters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and women staffers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some of the former reporters at the Argus group accept</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the actions of white editors may have been well- intentioned,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some feel that more could have been done to not only advance black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editorial staff but in terms of support from management for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">truth to be told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rafiq Rohan, formerly a political reporter in the Argus group,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disagrees with the contents of the letter published in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argues that at a time when he needed the support of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argus group, following his release from Robben Island, where he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had been sentenced to for 15 years for terrorism, &quot;my company put</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">me back on trial as they decided on my future within the group&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf denies this. &quot;It certainly was not in reaction,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he says, speaking in Afrikaans from the offices of Die Patriot,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the tabloid newsletter he edits and which is based at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative Party premises.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Die Mediaklub is a social club for reporters with the same</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goal of preserving the Afrikaans language and the heritage of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaner people,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flanked by a colleague from Radio Pretoria, Annemarie Joubert,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf explains the need for a club exclusively for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaner reporters. &quot;It is important that you unite people with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">common goals rather than diluting the strength of any group by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">having people of different cultures under one organisation. It is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">important that Boere journalists stand together and preserve what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is theirs and make sure no one encroaches on their culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf's office is slightly cramped. There is a poster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Paul Kruger lying on top of a filing cabinet; a Vierkleur flag</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of an old Boer republic on his desk and several framed black and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white photographs of Boere &quot;heroes&quot; on the wall. There is a plaque</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which reads: &quot;Onthou jul afkoms. Wees getrou! (Remember your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heritage. Be true to it.)&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf and Joubert complement each other. While she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">talks of the need to preserve and nurture the Afrikaans language,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he talks of the importance of having this &quot;precious language</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">polished for the youth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want an academy specifically for Afrikaans journalists in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the long term. The reasons for an academy are that it will allow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaans journalists to be trained in an environment in which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they feel comfortable and they will be taught by people who share</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the same political views making communication easier,&quot; says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joubert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf agrees - Die Mediaklub is definitely a long-term</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group as the Afrikaans language and its people are under threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argues that if it is acceptable to have a BJF, then it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should be acceptable to have an exclusively white journalists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group. &quot;They (BJF) are being racist by calling themselves black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not racist. We are just protecting ourselves because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policies like affirmative action threaten us,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joubert concurs: &quot;Our Mediaklub is not just a social event,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">although socialising plays an important part. It is to discuss</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">issues which directly affect Afrikaner journalists. For example,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all the press releases we receive are in English and it takes a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">long time to translate them into Afrikaans. We envisage a process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where we will unite, pull together all our resources and improve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the quality of our journalism by helping each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says the group currently meeting under the banner of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Die Mediaklub is small. Van der Graaf argues that numbers are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unimportant. &quot;It is not our numbers but our right-wing beliefs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that make us strong. We want to improve the lot of Afrikaans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists, but at the same time we want to improve the lot of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Afrikaner volk (people) as a whole,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf says the idea for a press club was initiated last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">October, but often the meetings degenerated into drinking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sessions. Thus, although socialising is still top of the list, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">monthly meetings are split into two sessions. First there is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lecture by an invited guest or a general discussion is held,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">followed by &quot;mingling&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf explains that Die Mediaklub has two sets of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">members. The first are bona fide journalists, while the second</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group are people involved in the media such as public relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admits that most of Die Mediaklub's members are from small</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">publications, mostly conservative newsletters or community radio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stations. None of the Afrikaans mainstream reporters have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recruited but &quot;we have an open invitation to all the media&quot;, he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Graaf cautions that anyone, provided they are white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the same aspirations of rescuing the volk from being</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">swallowed up by blacks, can join.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all want to reach our ultimate goal of white Afrikanerdom,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">just like the BJF is forming a group to reach their specific</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goals,&quot; he says, adding that his organisation is linked to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all-white Mynwerkers Unie, among others. Why? Because they have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">common goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he says, it would be &quot;suicidal&quot; to link up with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political party as Die Mediaklub's members come from various</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">backgrounds, albeit most of them are ultra- conservative.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Is there a place in the South African media for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">institutionalised ethnicity? Jacquie Golding-Duffy reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'WE are not anti-white, but pro-black,&quot; says Abbey Makoe, chair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the steering committee of the Black Journalists Forum (BJF) -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the lobby group recently launched and endorsed by Deputy President</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thabo Mbeki and SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum has provoked much debate, with some critics arguing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it has no place in a new South Africa where reconciliation should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be the order of the day. However, Makoe challenges this, arguing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that reconciliation can only take place when black journalists are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on an equal footing with their white colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is black? &quot;Black is everyone who is not white. Whites are</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans, but they are just not black Africans. Whether they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(whites) have any allegiance to Africa is another thing,&quot; he says,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">speaking from his simple office at Eaton House, Sandton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wall is covered with photographs of his daughter and close</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">friends, an autographed picture of Miss South Africa Peggy-Sue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khumalo and some prints of him reporting in the township. One</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wall-hanging reads: &quot;Be a visitor and not a spy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng editor of the weekly black magazine Drum, Makoe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">believes that the BJF is needed to unite black journalists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nationally. Based on a United States organisation - the National</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Association of Black Journalists, Makoe says strength lie in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim of the BJF is twofold:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* to act as a pressure group, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* to ensure training and development for black journalists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">striving to reach the same calibre of journalism as their white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The standard of everything from writing to the use of English</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has to be improved among black journalists. We have not had the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">privilege of enjoying a good education. All this must change and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we must train and empower one another,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makoe says white journalists, more often than not, deserve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their senior positions as they are fully qualified. But, he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cautions, it should not be forgotten that they acquired their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">education by inhumane means. &quot;While they were studying, police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were beating township youths. While they were studying, black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">youths were being imprisoned. While they were studying, blacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were being murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have what we are fighting for and we are still aspiring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to reap the fruits of education. We are not going to take anything</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from them. What we want to do is share in their education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On improving the education of black reporters, Makoe says the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BJF can assist in lobbying for overseas funds to ensure training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and improved multi-skilling for reporters in print and electronic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media. It has succeeded in getting a local banking institution to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agree to train black reporters in financial reporting. It is also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">close to clinching deals with overseas sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makoe argues that the BJF provides a platform for black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists to vocalise frustrations and difficulties. &quot;It is nice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to see my black brothers and sisters no longer being the minority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a bar full of white reporters. It is good to have the BJF where</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they have a voice and are allowed the opportunity to network with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">politicians and socialise with people in the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BJF has monthly imbizos and always has a guest speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makoe argues that the speakers talk off the record, allowing a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">degree of trust to be nurtured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are respected in the township, but once in the newsroom we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are merely told what to do by our white editors and are often</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">influenced by them. That all has to change and change it will ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the change happens we have to be fully equipped to do the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">job well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makoe says the future is either &quot;black or bleak&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If white corporations are committed to empowering black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists then it stands to reason that most of the upper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">echelons of companies will be black. If that does not happen and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it won't for many, many years, then racial polarisation will be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea for the BJF began as early as 1992 when a group of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black journalists informally gathered. &quot;We realised it was crucial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that we present ourselves as a monolithic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to be black and proud and not feel the need to emulate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white colleagues. We are not antagonistic and will not deny anyone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">admission to the BJF, but I do not see why a white journalist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would want to be a part of a group which is intent on training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black reporters. White reporters do not need the assistance we are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">planning to mete out to black journalists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BJF is planning to make a submission to the Truth and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reconciliation Commission and promises that it will be &quot;a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">revelation. It will not be deliberately evasive of the hardships</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">endured by black reporters, but it will recount personal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">experiences. It will also name spies which operated in the media -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a list which is long overdue,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the formation of Die Mediaklub, Makoe says he does not see</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the point of such a club other than it obstructing affirmative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">action and standing in the way of black development. &quot;I do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">object to it but they must be warned ... we are watching their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">every move.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stamp out the wildest risks taken by City of London derivative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">traders is expected to follow the $80-million scandal at NatWest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markets that this week helped to wipe nearly $900-million off the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stock market value of the banking group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Bellchambers, chief executive of the Futures and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Options Association (FOA), said the FOA was likely to consider</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proposals to provide better links between salaries and long-term</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">performance. It might issue new guidelines to improve the scrutiny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of dealing in complex financial instruments where failures have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opened the way for incidents such as the Barings collapse and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sumitomo copper scam.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NatWest insisted the $80-million charge it will take against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first-half profits was a conservative provision for the losses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">incurred by the &quot;mis-pricing errors&quot; believed to have been booked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Kyriacos Papouis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young interest rate options trader, who had worked for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NatWest Markets for about two years in what was his first City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">job, left the banking group towards the end of last year and was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said to be &quot;on leave pending further information&quot; by his new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">employer, the United States securities house, Bear Stearns. There</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was no comment from Neil Dodgson, suspended for failing properly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to supervise Papouis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite intensive investigation over the weekend by teams of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forensic accountants, NatWest said it was likely to take weeks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before its inquiry into the mis-pricing scandal was complete,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">although a representative said it appeared unlikely that more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heads would roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, NatWest heightened its internal supervisory systems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in an attempt to head off similar debacles elsewhere in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FOA's move on remuneration is expected to be welcomed by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Bank of England, which this week issued a warning about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dangers of tempting City traders to take risks to achieve big</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bonuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City is looking too accident-prone for comfort as an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international financial centre. The hole in the accounts of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NatWest Markets is symptomatic of deeper concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A clear line can be drawn from the Barings collapse two years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ago to the absorption of SG Warburg into the Swiss Bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporation and the difficulties at Morgan Grenfell Asset</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these events can be traced to weaknesses inside City-based</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">financial houses, most obviously the bonus structure which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provides such huge incentives to successful traders that it pays</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them to cheat, and encourages internal supervisors to see no evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FOA's backing for a more rational bonus structure, while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">welcome, should have come much earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second problem is the investment priorities of City houses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deutsche Morgan Grenfell will think nothing of paying multi-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million transfer fees to get a good trader or fund manager, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will not consider applying similar sums to the compliance or risk</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC is in danger of losing sight of the real</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'struggle' - creating a more equal social order, writes Heribert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE African National Congress Deputy Minister of Trade and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry, Phumzile Mlambo-Nguka, recently said black businessmen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should not be shy to say they wanted to become &quot;filthy rich&quot;. Such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an attitude rings of crass materialism, implying the neglect of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the poor majority in the drive to self-enrichment by an elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testing the reactions of 50 black students and aspiring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business executives revealed four clusters of opinion. Endorsement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the controversial statement overshadowed all criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vulgarity of being &quot;filthy rich&quot; amid a sea of shanty towns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">notwithstanding, the desire concurs perfectly well with the logic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of capitalism. Why should blacks exempt themselves from behaviour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that rewarded white beneficiaries so handsomely in the past?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism of black fatcats, without including white fatcats,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">smacks of racism indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had an equal playing field been provided in the past, &quot;black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business people would probably have been stinking rich already&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only is such a success story overdue, rich blacks create jobs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and enlarge the narrow white tax base. Lamenting the rise of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black bourgeoisie perpetuates the stereotype that it is &quot;natural&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for blacks to be poor and whites to be affluent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To step outside one's customary status is never unproblematic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resentful surprise about black Africans in luxury cars and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fancy houses, albeit a tiny group, mixes sneering envy with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">condescending admiration among many less fortunate whites. The old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white capitalists, on the other hand, delight in parading their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">new-found allies in profiteering. The more black faces, the easier</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it is to reject charges of racial capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet legitimate concerns about &quot;filthy rich&quot; blacks persist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those uneasy worries can be broken down into moral, egalitarian-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">socialist and political objections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moral reservations focus on the ostentatious consumption of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">few while the many suffer in poverty. An African communitarian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cultural tradition is said to impose obligations on the better-off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to remember where they came from. Giving back to their fellows and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;brothers&quot; is seen as moral duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wealth of white counterparts has been achieved partly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through apartheid exploitation. By endorsing a similar black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">selfishness, a new elite merely continues what is seen as the same</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shameless greed by hook or crook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike socialism, which aims at levelling all wealth, the moral</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">criticism does not assail affluence per se, but focuses on how it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been acquired. The speed with which new black millionaires</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">emerge makes it unlikely that they have earned their fortune by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the sweat of their brows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, moral critics have a field day denouncing this as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unethical behaviour. Yet even those politics of embarrassment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prove ineffectual in a climate where &quot;filthy richness&quot; becomes an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unabashed goal in itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egalitarian-socialist objections point to similar concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encouragement of the filthy rich occurs at the expense of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weak. While a minority of opportunists enrich themselves, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">masses are sidelined and ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this principled position, President Nelson Mandela needs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to be applauded for rejecting outright the request by black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business (National African Chambers of Commerce) to have all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outstanding taxes before 1994 relinquished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the refusal to entertain special tax exemptions for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black business should not only have been justified by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confusion it would create in the tax- collection system, but by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the duty of the rich to finance the new order, regardless of past</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;taxation without representation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet such moralistic and egalitarian reasoning falls on deaf</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ears in a neo- liberal climate that celebrates individual success</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at all costs. Communal solidarity impedes the accumulation of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individual fortunes. A global market celebrates rootless and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ruthless profiteering that eschews civic connectedness and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">national sacrifices as old-fashioned virtues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political reservations about filthy richness stand on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strongest ground. Not only is it unwise for an ANC Cabinet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">minister to provoke its poor constituency with such inflammatory</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">language, the ANC encourages class warfare if it loses sight of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">destabilising inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC turns its back on a history of struggle that once aimed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at racial capitalism as its main target. During that distant past,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">activists romanticised the simple, modest life with survival wages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for unionists. Bourgeois lifestyles were denounced as those of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">class enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the most, Toyotas, not German luxury cars, were to be the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">signature of successful revolutionaries. Nowadays, according to an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">insider, some parliamentarians almost panic at the thought of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being overlooked for directorships and other private-sector</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appointments where the real power is seen to be located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When former activists turn into instant millionaires by what is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">called &quot;overdue career changes&quot;, they not only bury their own</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">history but confirm the triumph of non- racial capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, was the anti- apartheid struggle never more than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">getting a larger slice of the pie? Was it merely a materialistic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fight against racist exclusion from capitalist spoils rather than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">creating an alternative, more humane and equal social order?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was asked, &quot;What goes through your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mind when you fly over a squatter settlement?&quot; He answered rather</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">complacently: &quot;I think there is an enormous amount of patience</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">among the people in those shacks. I don't think there's any kind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of explosive sentiment in reaction to the perceived lack of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">delivery of houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Mbeki also realises that patience wears thin sooner or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">later. One would have expected him to stress government's highest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concern with speedy delivery. Instead, he focuses on the benign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">response of the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lines from Gillo Pontecorvo's classical film on the Algerian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">revolution, Battle of Algiers, read: &quot;It is difficult to start a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">revolution, more difficult to sustain it. But it's later, when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we've won, that the real difficulties will begin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not exactly a revolution, the ANC has achieved its major</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goal to ditch apartheid. It was liberation that held the broad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">church of the ANC together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of a new core ideology, the ANC is in danger of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">falling apart as manifold fissures emerge. What could substitute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for successful liberation as the common bond for different</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interests? Will black empowerment and enrichment fill the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ideological vacuum?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic growth and development seem to have emerged as the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goal behind which all factions should unite. However, the strategy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to achieve this is intensely contested as the debate about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">macro- economic policy, growth, employment and redistribution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Gear), indicates. It is a conflict over growth at whose cost, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the noble goal proves more divisive than unifying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redistribution and transformation have been other initial core</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ideas but they too have fallen by the wayside as too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controversial. Redistribution would happen mainly at the expense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of whites and is associated with discredited socialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redistribution through progressive taxes would create a hostile</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment climate. South Africans already feel overtaxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A one-time limited levy for equalisation has been almost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unanimously rejected by the old establishment. That only leaves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transformation in the minds and attitudes of people where no costs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are involved. Reconciliation and nation-building operate only in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the symbolic realm and fail to deliver material improvements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once uniquely inspiring vision of non- racialism has also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">faded away. Non- racialism has been undermined by racially based</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">affirmative action, an economically inexpensive and politically</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wise corrective for the legacy of legalised racism from a business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After decades of colour-consciousness, colour-blindness can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hardly be expected. Claims for entitlements and greater</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representativeness of the racially disadvantaged remain on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agenda of Africanists and populists. Racial integration at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">social level has so far been confined to a small elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even university students drift into the cultural comfort of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their own groups, with only superficial interaction across racial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what is left to inspire the heterogeneous ideologies and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interests of ANC members to be pursued in a single party?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black empowerment - a euphemism for more control by a small</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">privileged elite? Will patronage and personal enrichment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constitute the new glue for a fragmenting movement? Endorsing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;filthy richness&quot; seems the surest recipe for self-destruction of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a party in need of a new mission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - CRIME and unemployment grab the headlines, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an even greater obstacle to putting South Africa on the fast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">growth track is illiteracy. The fact that the National Economic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) put the issue high on its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agenda at its first meeting this year highlights the growing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concern that without education, all efforts to boost the economy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be stymied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nedlac constituencies committed themselves to finding a way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to fund industry-based training by the next council meeting on May</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The decision coincides with Adult Literacy Week, and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tabling in Cabinet of the Department of Labour's Green Paper on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">human resource development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that a quarter of the population can barely make out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the headline, let alone get as far as the first sentence of this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">article, is on the agenda again. The most recent literacy study</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">completed in 1995 showed that 10-million to 15-million South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans are functionally illiterate, in other words, they do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have the competencies of a standard seven school pupil. Between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seven and 10-million do not have the competencies of a standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">five pupil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Enrico Fourie, director of the National Literacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-operation (NLC) - an umbrella group for more than 150 non-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governmental organisations in the literacy field - functional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">illiteracy entails an inability to abstract information, draw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conclusions, or make the necessary associations in a given text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the statistical parameters are measured against an ideal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">definition of what standard seven or five competency should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">represent, the impact of the disrupted and historically unequal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African education system throws even these figures in doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that close on 15-million people simply cannot read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of functional illiteracy on the economy only becomes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obvious when, for example, you are stuck behind someone who takes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20 minutes at the automatic teller machine. Fourie explains:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the stigma attached to illiteracy, it is internalised,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially because of our society's hegemonic First World culture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">emphasising tertiary learning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, studies show that widespread dysfunctionality is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially concentrated in the 16-to-25 and 35-to-60 age groups -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">critical groupings whose reading problem is eating away at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">future growth and development of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to the problem is that the most radical programmes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undertaken by the government and institutions focus on employed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">workers, rather than the unemployed, who are the greatest victims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of illiteracy. Consequently, the programmes concentrate on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industry-based training rather than holistic educational</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">competency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wendy Dobson at Nedlac says the debate boils down to &quot;who pays,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">how much, and what is the money going to be used for? If there is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a payroll levy, is it applicable to companies that already pay a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lot on training?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national human resources policy envisaged by the Department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Labour will establish a national training fund. Currently,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">certain sectors such as the hospitality and metal and engineering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industries have formalised training funds that set training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standards and implement them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question then is whether there should be a single national</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">front or sectoral ones. Sectoral funds raise concerns that certain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">areas would slip through, while a national fund that would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">formalised and tripartite in nature could set appropriate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standards, decide on national needs and priorities, and then</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">support sectoral funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour supports the national fund concept and is also proposing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a 4% payroll levy. According to Dobson, business has a different</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">view. &quot;If they can avoid the levy they will. Where they are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">already spending a lot on training, which is the case in the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would want to negotiate a rebate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She adds that business believes a national fund would be too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bureaucratic and too distanced from sectoral needs, while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">encouraging the proliferation of government bodies and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, such a fund and body would not help the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unemployed or special interests, like the informal sector, which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">encompasses the bulk of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate in Nedlac reflects a positive reaction to the formal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sector's human resource issue, but the Presidential Lead Project</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to promote Adult Basic Education and Training (Abet) for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">majority of the population is floundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the Department of Education has created a line</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">function to deal with Abet, but has not provided a line function</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">budget item for it. As a result, R50- million was allocated as an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interim amount to the programme, and represents less than 1% of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the entire education budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulty of prioritising adult education is patently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obvious, but the pressing timeframes imposed by the growth,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">employment and redistribution (Gear) policy needs should throw a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">different light on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gear's success depends on building an economy capable of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">competing in the global market. A reasonably skilled workforce is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">central to this model - hence the concentration on human resource</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development. But the underlying South African literacy statistic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cannot support the vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourie argues that the impact of illiteracy is not only felt in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terms of the economy and human resources, it also threatens the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fledgling democracy in a far more serious way, because people are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">handicapped by lacking basic political skills, which further</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undermines the domestic and social environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the R50-million in education is being spent on a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project called Ithuteng - ready to learn. It focuses on 10 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adult learners per province, and is being conducted with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">parallel project funded by the European Union, and initiated by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the NLC - the &quot;thousand learner project&quot;. The aim is to test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standards, norms and values in terms of developing a basic Abet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">programme for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourie explains: &quot;We are trying to develop a localised system</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with which we can reach as many learners as possible with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">least possible resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next step is to develop key policy guidelines, which they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hope to formalise through legislation by 1998. At the moment,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">however, the statistics are bleak for new adult learners in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African system. According to EDU, an education statistics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agency, only 330 000 new learners have entered the system per year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abet vision outlines a system that can provide literacy at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a very low cost without compromising a general education standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system should be flexible and comply with particular community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">needs. The initial result of the pilot learner programmes shows</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that it can be done. But the lack of resources in education are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frustrating hopes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The example of the Gauteng province night- school system is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">illuminating. While the infrastructure is available, and gives the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">province an advantage, the system of adult education simply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reflects the formal education system. This is not what a fully</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fledged Abet programme would do; it should provide a base from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which adult learners could enter the job market, and would begin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to integrate with the national human resource programmes,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supplementing their functional approach and developing well-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rounded assets to society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of money and strategic planning is preventing the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development of such a system even where infrastructure exists. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lobby for a restitution fund would begin to address the question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point of the Adult Literacy Week marketing exercise is to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">emphasise that adult basic education is not only a problem for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education Department, it is a national crisis and should be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">planned for as such.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Sentiment has improved, but to capitalise on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turnaround, Trevor Manuel must define the strategy for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">implementing Gear, argues Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SO, Trevor Manuel will get to present his first Budget after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all, despite rumours of a Cabinet reshuffle earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already he has quietened his detractors by showing the deficit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">target is on track, albeit due to increased revenue collection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rather than expenditure cuts, but no matter. This finance minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is determined to stick to his guns - which leaves him with very</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">little room to manoeuvre next Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he is to live up to the expectations created by the growth,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy unveiled last June -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and specifically, the deficit projections - the 1997/98 Budget</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will confine itself to tinkering rather than large-scale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expenditure changes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the same token, the Katz Commission on taxation is not due</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to report until August, thus the revenue side is equally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constrained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party's Budget Proposals, presented this week,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">call for a rise in the rate of value added tax to 15%, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">analysts consider such a move unlikely in the face of fierce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposition from the labour movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, there is little scope to lower company taxes or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">compensate for bracket creep in personal income tax rates. Some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">changes to the secondary tax on companies and marketable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">securities tax are possible; the DP would like to see them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">abolished, along with donations tax and estate duty - at a cost to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fiscus of R1,8-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important than the nuts and bolts, however, is the overall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">structure. Says Nico Czypionka, chief economist at Standard Bank:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We realise the government has little room to manoeuvre in terms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of policy, but this has to be the year of implementation. What we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">want to see from the Budget are the details of how Gear will be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">set in motion. That is what the markets are waiting for - and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would give Manuel the opportunity to make a real impact on macro-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">economic policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, Manuel would do well to capitalise on the turnaround</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in sentiment witnessed in the past two months. The South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chamber of Business's confidence index was up again in February,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by 0,9 of a percentage point, thanks to the stronger rand, higher</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exports and soaring share prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, warns the chamber, the Budget needs to be convincing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Continued domestic and foreign confidence depends on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">performance of the Gear-directed economy.&quot; In this context,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sticking to the 4% deficit target for this financial year is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">paramount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important to the labour constituency than fiscal probity,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">however, is reprioritisation of expenditure. Says James Heintz of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the National Labour and Economic Development Institute (Naledi):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our biggest concern is how the money is spent. We would like to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">see a greater emphasis on development spending - health,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">education, welfare and housing must take priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He raises concerns about the lack of participation in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">budgetary process by the various stakeholders. &quot;In effect, we now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have 10 budgets rather than one, because each province gets to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allocate its resources independently of national priorities. We</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">need a co-ordinating institution to ensure that healthcare,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">welfare, education and housing are not sidelined by the provincial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivery is certainly top of everyone's agenda - and pivotal to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gear's success. And while the lower growth levels predicted for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this year will, to some extent, restrict the authorities' options,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the revised figures give no cause for alarm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, was at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pains to lift growth hopes this week, predicting an increase of 3%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for this year, against a consensus forecast among economists of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about 2,5% and a projected 2,9% set out in Gear.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from retailing fuel, the synthetic fuel giant confirmed this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol communications manager Alfonso Niemand said Sasol Oil had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bought about 20 sites in the region which it had leased to other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">oil companies on a &quot;strictly commercial basis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol has previously not disclosed this strategy, which many of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its rivals in the crude oil industry had long suspected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol's buying spree in Gauteng was exposed this week after the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">announcement of a fuel retailing deal flagged as a &quot;black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">empowerment&quot; move. A consortium, led by Naledi Petroleum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investments and Sasol, has set up a new fuel retail company -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naledi Petroleum - in which Sasol has the minority 22,5% stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geoffery-Mabule Hlabangane, chair of Naledi Petroleum, said the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group would eventually develop a network of 60 retail outlets in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng. He said it would build four or five of its own, while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many of the rest would be bought and leased from Sasol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlabangane said Sasol owned several prime sites - including top</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engen &quot;one stops&quot; - that were leased to other oil companies. &quot;It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is a well-known fact,&quot; he said. Naledi would take over stations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when the leases had expired. Naledi, which had been poised to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strike a deal with Engen, was also talking to other fuel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol is barred from retailing by a contract with the oil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">companies that is a pivotal part of the sanctions era regulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governing the fuel industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other side to the contract is that the oil companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tolerate the government's hefty subsidy to Sasol's synthetic fuel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">division - the lynchpin of apartheid's &quot;total onslaught&quot; oil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policies. That subsidy will be phased out by 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But although the contract forbids Sasol from retailing, it does</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not forbid it from owning sites - providing a gap for Sasol to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">position itself in anticipation of deregulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indicated he is in favour of a phased deregulation of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol is the main supplier of fuel in Gauteng with its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">synthetic fuel plants and its Natref fuel refinery, which it owns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">jointly with Total SA, the local arm of the French oil company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Johannesburg press conference announcing the Naledi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deal, Sasol executives sat among the journalists while the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consortium's black bosses took centre stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol, once a Broederbond stronghold, has been itching to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participate in an empowerment deal since 1995 and even published a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statement two years ago that it was negotiating with a black-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controlled fuel company. It provided no names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlabangane told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the new company had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">secured a R50-million loan from the Amalgamated Banks of South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, much of which would be used to buy from Sasol several</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supply contracts - deals to provide fuel to individual businesses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or, for example, army installations. The rest would go towards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">building up its network of stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that within three years the group wanted 40 high-volume</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stations in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ownership of fuel stations is governed by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rationalisation Plan - the other pillar of the boycott-era</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">regulations. The Ratplan divides up the country's stations among</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the local representatives of the oil majors, which also enjoy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">guaranteed margins - the sweeteners offered to keep them here</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">during the sanctions era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of less profitable sites, oil companies are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reluctant to hand over valuable licences, in which case they are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distributed on a roster basis, so that all the big majors, as well</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as Sasol, take turns in supplying them. Sasol has about 20 of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these sites, many of which will be leased to Naledi Petroleum, in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">addition to its other sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlabangane confirmed that Naledi had yet to be incorporated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into the Ratplan - the only stumbling block to the deal. But he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was confident it would get the green light by the time Naledi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opened its doors in June. He said all that remained was for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Petroleum Industry Association (Sapia) to give its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plans the nod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sapia chairman Colin McLelland said the association was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">examining Naledi's proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naledi's consortium boasts the features of a typical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">empowerment deal. It includes the investment arms of two struggle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisations - the South African National Civics Organisation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Sanco) and the National Hostel Residents Association (Nahora).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also includes the influential National Black Retailers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Association, which has offices close to Sasol's Randburg base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanco and the hostel company were brought to the party by a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mysterious company called Powerlib, whose flamboyant boss, Eric</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Molefe, has been talking to Sasol for about two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside Sasol's efforts to forge ties with black business has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been its close relationship with the black taxi industry. At one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stage during negotiations at the National Economic Development and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour Council this relationship was exposed as being excessively</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">close: the taxi industry's statement on the controversial topic of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol's subsidy was identical to Sasol's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlabangane - the owner of two McDonald's outlets who has worked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at Mobil and then Engen - said he was unconcerned about Sasol's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">motives for the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlabangane insisted this was a genuine &quot;black empowerment&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deal, which would not merely enrich him and the other consortium</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heads as the investment arms of both Sanco and Nahora would feed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">back to millions of people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - What exactly is South Africa doing in its new,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">state-of-the-art Antarctic research base? Lesley Cowling reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PICTURES of Antarctica show a pristine wonderland: stunning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white snow and poster- blue seas, penguins in their zoot suits,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the wildest cleanest place on earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's also the coldest, windiest place on earth. In winter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there's no light, in summer there's no dark, and humans could not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">survive in this wasteland of ice and snow long without modern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its inhospitable nature has kept it pure. Now more and more</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nations have set up camp on the ice. They're there to do research,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they say, in the world's largest natural laboratory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to prove it, the nations with bases in Antarctica are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">signatories to a treaty that declares the continent a natural</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reserve devoted to peace and science. There is a prohibition on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mining in the area and rules for environmental protection of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continent have been established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's involvement in the Antarctic dates back to 1959,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when Norway decided to vacate its base in Queen Maud Land and give</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it to South Africa. South Africa also became one of the original</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">signatories to the Antarctic Treaty at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norway's base was built on an ice shelf and, as the years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">passed, it began to sink into the ice. So when the South Africans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">began planning a new base, they decided to site it on rock, 160km</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inland from the coast. An added bonus was the view: the old base</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">looked onto an expanse of snow and ice, but from the new base -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unromantically dubbed Sanae 4 - you can see a range of polar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new base looks from a distance like three linked train</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">carriages on a bridge, perched up on stilts. It cost more than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R30-million, and was specially designed for Antarctic conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rounded ends and smoothed shape decrease wind resistance and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the walls are made of fibreglass to increase insulation from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cold. The stilts allow snow to blow past the building instead of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collecting against it and burying it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this effort was to make life easier for the teams of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scientists, researchers and support staff that spend summer or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">winter periods there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Skinner, who co-ordinates the scientific projects in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antarctica, says the Department of Environmental Affairs and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourism, which is responsible for the Antarctic programme, does</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not conduct research itself. Instead, they make funds of between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R2-million and R3-million available for university or other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">institutions to conduct research there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application process is quite rigorous: research proposals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are vetted by international and local peers, then a national task</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group decides which projects should be supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A chosen few get to board the SAAgulhas in November and go to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antarctica for the few summer months, gathering things like rocks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or setting up equipment to collect more arcane data, before</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heading back to do the real analysis in university labs in more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">temperate climes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few very hardy souls do what's called &quot;overwintering&quot; -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">staying for the dark, freezing Antarctic winter. Four physicists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be doing that this year, working on the research projects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that have been designed for the dark months. At least one of these</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involves looking at the moving cloud of colours that are the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pole's equivalent of Northern lights, also known as the aurora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wintering team from Potchefstroom and Natal universities will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">also measure magnetic fields, radar, cosmic rays and radio waves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not just about science. Skinner says South Africa needs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a presence in Antarctica, because &quot;we need to remain party to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">future decisions about the continent&quot;. A number of states have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">laid territorial claims to Antarctica. South Africa is not one of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them. But that does not mean letting someone else camp in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">backyard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In a conversation with Benjamin Pogrund, Harry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oppenheimer reflects on his life in business and defends his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">companies' stance on apartheid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARRY OPPENHEIMER carries his 88 years lightly. &quot;I feel well</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and I enjoy life so I'm very lucky at my age,&quot; he says. He's a bit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stooped and says his hearing is not what it was, although there is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">no sign of difficulty during conversation. Walking is his chief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exercise. He reads a lot and enjoys biographies and Victorian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">novels, especially Trollope.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He comes to his office at Anglo American's headquarters at 44</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Main Street most days of the week but usually stays for only a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">short time: &quot;I read the papers, I talk to my friends and they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">treat me kindly, and they even ask my views from time to time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oppenheimer is upbeat about South Africa. He is &quot;immensely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pleased at what has taken place&quot; and praises Nelson Mandela &quot;who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is extraordinarily good in having prevented violence and promoting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goodwill&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also believes the government is &quot;making a serious effort&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and is &quot;doing quite well&quot; to build the economy - the answer to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">meeting the aspirations of the have-nots before their rage boils</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His praises are tempered by criticism of the government's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">performance. He also acknowledges that Anglo American Corporation,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of which he was chairman until his retirement at the end of 1982,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">did less than it could have done to buck apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His criticisms of the government are voiced as mildly and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">carefully as his praises: &quot;I don't think this government so far</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has shown enormous ability at national administration,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the other hand what could you expect? It could have been a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">great deal worse - and I'm not certain that it isn't just as good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as the last government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime is his greatest anxiety for the future. &quot;It results in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feeling of agitation in the country, it results in lots of people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leaving the country, and I think it's a major factor in preventing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the degree of foreign investment which we hope for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of us know people who have been hijacked or whose car has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been stolen, and they're very lucky if they haven't been shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is worried, too, about possible moves towards one-party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rule: &quot;I think there is a tendency, in the African way of looking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at things, not to scorn democracy, but to see democracy in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">different way. I wonder very much whether many of our masters in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the political field really think in terms of parties and an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposition party which one day will come into power and then in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turn lose power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not sure that they think like that, I hope that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">eventually they will. Some people do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has to be affirmative action, he says, but cautions that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;you've got to be jolly careful with it. I find certainly in this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">office that some of the black people - nowadays we have many more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in senior jobs than we used to - are not very keen on affirmative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is cautious, too, about South Africa's attempts to influence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the world. &quot;I know that we have prestige, which has largely again</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been given to us by Mandela, but I don't think we are a country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which can really change the world very easily outside our own</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">borders. I hope we can set an example for other countries which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have the same set of problems but I very much doubt that we can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">send troops about the place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says that his support for the Progressives in their various</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forms over the years continues through the Democratic Party: &quot;It's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the only party I really could support. Much as I admire the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Congress it's not for me, I don't feel it's my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">party. I can't imagine myself voting for the Nationalists: I am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">afraid their past is such that I really couldn't bring myself to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do that, certainly not in their present form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that the DP talks a lot of sense and I think Tony Leon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">talks a lot of sense. I do not know how far they will succeed, how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">far they will get people to vote for them and how far they can get</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black support, which is vital in South Africa as it is now, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nevertheless it's the only party that I feel really happy voting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking back at his life he believes his greatest contribution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is that he has been &quot;a reasonably successful businessman in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sense of carrying on in a sensible way from what my father built</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and doing it, naturally, in my own way, not in his, because you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can't try to be exactly the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that I've tried, though not always as successfully and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">energetically as I should, to run businesses in a way which really</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">did help to build a better sort of society and a better sort of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But did the many industrial, mining and commercial companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controlled or influenced by Anglo American do much to buck</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apartheid? They could, for example, have recognised trade unions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for blacks even if the law did not recognise them, and could have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">focused on training blacks and paying better salaries. On the gold</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mines, no one made full use of the government concession allowing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">married quarters for up to 3% of workers. If his companies had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taken a lead in these industrial and mining matters couldn't that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have profoundly influenced South Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is much in what you say,&quot; says Oppenheimer. &quot;I think we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">did some of these things. I agree that we didn't do as much as we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should have done. On the other hand, to take a defensive line</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about our group I think we can honestly say that in the major</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business organisations we were always in the lead. We were, if not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rushing along with the angels, we were following on to them, in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cautious way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About housing on the mines: we aimed at and had elaborate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">schemes for housing 10% (of the total labour force). We were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stopped from doing this by Dr Hendrik Verwoerd (minister of Native</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affairs and then prime minister) and I think it is fair to say,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and fair criticism, that having been stopped, we didn't go on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fighting as hard as we should have done. We tended to hide behind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fact that we were prevented from doing all that we wanted to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the political level he believes that he might have supported</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the notion of a qualified franchise - the policy pursued by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Progressives - for too long. But he does not regret that he did</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">support it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was Jefferson - I may have got the name wrong - who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said that it is really impossible to have a democracy in an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">uneducated country. I felt that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I still feel that one of the great pieces of damage which the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party did in the country was that they prevented what had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to happen from happening over a period. It would have been better</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for all of us, black and white, if the present position where you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have a complete democracy, in theory anyhow, had been reached more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gradually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That would, in the opinions I had then - and I am not entirely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prepared to run away from them - have been arrived at by having an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">educational qualification for the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I may have gone on too long because it became impractical. I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">think it was made impractical largely by liberal-minded people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rather than the right-wing people in the sense that they always</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">went for one man, one vote and they thought that anything else was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wrong and somewhat immoral. I don't think that, but of course it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would have reached the same point - the same result would have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been reached - and I wouldn't be surprised if it wouldn't have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been reached at about the same time. You would have had movement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gradually over a period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the benefit of hindsight, could more have been done to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">counter the trend over some four decades in which election after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">election more and more whites voted for the Nationalists?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oppenheimer: &quot;I certainly think we tried pretty hard. I am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">afraid they went that way because they were frightened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He turns away questions about his wealth and media comparisons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between him and the Sultan of Brunei, said to be the richest man</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the world, and Microsoft's Bill Gates. &quot;I'm lucky enough to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have money but I'm not in the same ballgame as those sort of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that you are in a country where there aren't vast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">numbers of people who have great fortunes as they have in America</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">means you stand out more than other people do. Also, because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">diamonds are sort of romantic and excite people, people imagine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the whole thing is much bigger than it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally, what would he most like to be remembered for?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You certainly want to be remembered for being better than you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">really were. I would like to be thought of as having lived a life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which on the whole gave proof of a certain degree of wisdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether I would justify such a recollection is for other people to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I would find it nice if that is the way people thought of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The media are less than honest in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statements to the truth commission regarding their role in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apartheid, argues Guy Berger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEARLY nobody noticed when FW de Klerk told the truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission last year that government disinformation &quot;could have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">created a climate&quot; allowing for gross human rights violations to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This surprise admission stands in contrast to the way the press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is analysing its role during apartheid. There has been some focus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on those worst-case journalists who spied and lied on behalf of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the system. The dirt is coming out on how weak or pro-apartheid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editors in the &quot;liberal&quot; press spiked and censored stories that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should have been published.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been criticism that conservatives in the &quot;mainstream&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media under PW Botha agreed to &quot;keep their house in order&quot;,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leaving it to the alternative weeklies to go it alone in exposing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the worst abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there has been very little assessment of how even the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">liberal press performed day-to-day legitimation of racial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">domination - even if some papers criticised the corruption and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crimes that flowed so logically from this system. The Sunday Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recently recanted some of its most brazen records, such as when it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">celebrated a murderous South African Defence Force raid on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana with the headline: &quot;The Guns of Gaborone&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Independent Newspapers drew up a dossier setting out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">historical &quot;shortcomings&quot; in the way its papers - under the Argus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">company - had accepted press restrictions. In hot response, four</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">retired editors of Independent papers have now defended their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">personal records as campaigners against apartheid's gross</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">violations of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvey Tyson, former editor of The Star, declared this week he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would never apologise for what he had done as a journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidently, he has forgotten the regret expressed in his book</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editors Under Fire. In it, he admits to having fallen for security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police manipulation in publicising allegations that &quot;KGB colonel&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Slovo had blown up his wife, Ruth First. Missing in all this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flurry, however, is any scrutiny of how everyday, routine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reporting reflected - and contributed to - a climate where black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lives were cheap and human rights went unrecognised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike government supporters like the late former Sunday Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editor, Tertius Myburgh, Harvey Tyson was a liberal editor. Yet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">like most whites, Tyson probably believed the Slovo story to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plausible at the time. He viewed his role as a watchdog -- but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">failed to see any difference between the legitimate property</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">owners and the real thieves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal press was, of course, not the same as the SABC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which never seriously claimed to be anything other than propaganda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not as different as people like Tyson would like to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">think. It reflected establishment assumptions where white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">newsmakers and white audiences counted. Blacks did not. Only a few</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">brave, white English-speaking journalists saw the role of black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resistance beyond their papers' liberal - and limited -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attacks by Nationalists added to the illusion harboured by many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white liberal journalists that the key actors were themselves and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the government. Not black South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an understandable thing for people to assume that they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are a leading force for freedom when victimised by a bullying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government, and enduring court cases and ever tighter legislative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal journalists may be forgiven for evaluating their role</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in relation to such pressures. But this logic does fail to locate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them in the broader sweep of things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal press operated in, and took its cues from, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prevailing white landscape. A handful of white editors rose above</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the conventional wisdom of the day. They &quot;opened an account&quot; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they paid a price: exile for Donald Woods, loss of their jobs in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the cases of Raymond Louw, Allister Sparks and Tony Heard. White</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists like these, who tried to lead the white readershp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">market, rather than follow its prejudices and its interests, also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ran into falling circulations. The decline was not compensated for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by black readers who failed to attract advertising revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it wasn't such context that constrained the role of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">liberal press, it was the confined outlook of most white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these journalists did campaign against &quot;petty&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apartheid. But macro- apartheid - especially after bantustan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">independence -- got less critical attention. Coverage sometimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pilloried the pass laws; it routinely neglected the wages paid to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">migrant workers. The problem with the liberal press is not only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that its opposition did not go far enough. Nor even that its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">champions like Tyson did not realise that there was a lot further</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was worse was the day-to-day reflection of what South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa was about. Black people were invisible in most newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you were Desmond Tutu, you got coverage - usually negative - in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Star. If you were a golf caddie featured in a Daily Dispatch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">picture, you'd be lucky to have even been photographed in the rain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standing next to white men enjoying the shelter of an umbrella,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with your name captioned as &quot;Jackson&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record of black journalistic advancement is similarly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pitiful. In 30 years, no white editor matched the record of Drum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editor, Anthony Sampson, who empowered an historic generation of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">top quality black reporters, writers and investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To understand all this context is not to justify the role of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the liberal press. It is to explain it. The press today is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unlikely to repeat its general complicity with the day-to-day,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">humdrum mechanics of racial domination. But liberal journalists -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of whatever colour - may continue to overlook their role in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legitimating other kinds of domination. This is the way that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media represents how men dominate women, adults abuse children,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">urban people scorn the rural, and the voices of the able drown out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">those of the disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FW de Klerk has acknowledged that the way that realities are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reflected can contribute to a climate where human rights are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">violated. Journalists need to do likewise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fantastic, but it would offer a possible explanation for otherwise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">improbable penetration of that particularly vicious drug, Mandrax,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into South Africa, which is said to account for 90% of world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if such a crazed plot was hatched under the old regime, is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it not still being pursued by the &quot;old guard&quot; which maintains a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">considerable influence in the new South African Police Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(SAPS)?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence before the truth commission has demonstrated how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individual members of the security forces enriched themselves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">while working to destabilise the country in the 1980s and early</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1990s. Do recent allegations of senior police involvement in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organised crime reflect a conspiracy to render the country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ungovernable --- at least for the African National Congress ---</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and profit personally by fomenting criminal activity ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the cock-up theory. The extraordinary disclosures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this week by the SAPS on police crime --- that proportionally more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police than members of the public were arrested for murder and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attempted murder last year, and twice as many &quot;lawmen&quot; were held</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for driving under the influence --- is a reminder that for decades</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the force was a safety net for the white unemployable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a heritage which guarantees cock-ups. And evidence of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cock-ups on a monumental scale was provided by similarly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">horrifying statistics which emerged last month on the register of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">firearms --- showing, among other things, that the police have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lost 18 600 guns, 1 103 of which have been relicensed to private</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individuals, and that 19 600 convicted criminals and 1 901 others</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">declared unfit to carry a gun have firearms licences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the government holds to the cock-up theory, we would suggest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a wholesale purge of the police is justified. At the very least it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will improve the criminal profile of the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the conspiracy theory holds sway, is it not time to get</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Richard Goldstone back in harness?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There is something a little distasteful about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Independent Group's &quot;confession&quot; to the Truth and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reconciliation Commission as to its sins during the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like its much-trumpeted &quot;international advisory board&quot; of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consultants, the submission smacks more of a public relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exercise than a genuine contribution to South African journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's apparent failure to consult some its key editors ---</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">serving and retired --- before submitting an apology on their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">behalf is both improper and symptomatic of the managerial ethos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which was in large part responsible for the feeble performance of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Argus stable in fighting apartheid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, without question, a need for critical examination of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the performance of South African media during the apartheid era,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including the &quot;liberal&quot; press. The appalling treatment of black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists should be central to such a critique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is to be expected --- demanded, if necessary --- of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">major newspaper groups which profited hugely from the apartheid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years that they facilitate and fund such an exercise. But it is an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exercise which does not fall within the purview of Desmond Tutu's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">overworked commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission was set up to investigate gross human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rights abuses and the factors which gave rise to them. By</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">troubling the commission with its comparatively petty squabbles,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the press is in danger of belittling the terrible pain suffered by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the victims of those atrocities, their families and their friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is a role for the truth commission where the newspaper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industry is concerned, it is in the limited but nonetheless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">important task of uncovering details of covert state operations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against the press. In particular, we would urge the commission to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">help identify government agents who infiltrated the country's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">independent newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We sympathise entirely with Thabo Mbeki's view that informers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should be forced into the open. It is unacceptable that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reputations of such people, who profited from a betrayal of trust,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should be protected in the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - INVESTIGATIONS into allegations that former Zimbabwean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">president Reverend Canaan Banana repeatedly raped and sexually</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">abused at least one police aide-de-camp have begun &quot;in full</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seriousness&quot;, a police source said here this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commissioner (of police, Augustine Chiuri) said inquiries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would begin immediately, and they did,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would give no further details, but pointed out that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspector Jefta Dube, Banana's former aide who claimed that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ex-president had raped him, had indicated at least one police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officer - still in the force - and an army captain, were also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">victims.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube's claims surfaced during his trial for murder, in which he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">claimed he had killed another officer for calling him &quot;Banana's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">homosexual wife&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very important for us,&quot; the source said. &quot;There are a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lot of angry policemen over this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court heard that police had been receiving reports of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banana's alleged improprieties since 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube was sentenced last week to 10 years in jail for murdering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constable Patrick Mashiri in 1995. Dube's defence partially</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accepted by Judge David Bartlett, was that his ordeal under the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">former head of state caused him such severe psychological distress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that he was mentally disordered at the time of the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banana has made no attempt to change his normal routine, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turns up daily in his grey Gauteng-registered Mercedes at his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">office at the University of Zimbabwe where he heads the department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of religious studies. He has refused interviews, and told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reporters he is consulting his lawyers over the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's state-controlled media covered the issue as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">briefly as possible. The Herald, the country's main daily paper,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reported it under the headline: &quot;Policeman jailed for 10 years for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">murder.&quot; Banana's name was mentioned far down in the piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The privately owned Zimbabwe Independent, however, ran the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">story in detail, and the entire print run was sold out early last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G, which reported comprehensively on the revelations,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - A hydro-electric project dam in northern Namibia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could displace 2 000 people. Graham Hopwood reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Himba people in north-west Namibia are battling a plan to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">construct a hydro-power station and dam on the Kunene River which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could flood up to 400km2 of their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want the construction of the dam. It's our ancestral</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">residence,&quot; says Himba chief Muatjindika Mutambo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the project designated for the Epupa area goes ahead, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Himba will not only lose grazing land, but also many of their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ancestral graves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutambo rejects the possibility that the government will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">compensate them financially if they move from the area. &quot;How do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you pay for ancestral graves with money?&quot; he asked at a recent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutambo travelled 900km to Windhoek last month to plead his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people's case against the dam, but his arguments have so far made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">little headway with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate over the dam is rapidly turning into a party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political war of words, with the Himba enlisting the support of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the official opposition, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swapo MP Angelika Muharukua is leading a campaign urging that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the dam be speeded up as it would bring development to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">isolated region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claims have suggested that the technical committee overseeing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the project is pressing ahead with plans for a massive dam against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the advice of official consultants from Norway and Sweden, who are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">currently conducting a feasibility study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feasibility team said in its first report that the final</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigations should concentrate on one site only - a smaller,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lower impact dam in the Baynes mountains. The Baynes option would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flood only 94km2 and directly affect about 100 Himba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team's report recommended that &quot;on the basis of technical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feasibility, economic viability and environmental acceptability&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Baynes option be subject to a full feasibility study and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">environmental impact assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Namibian-Angolan joint technical committee on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Epupa project differed with the consultants' findings. Although</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only Namibia will benefit from electricity generated by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project, Angolan representatives are serving on the technical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">committee since the Kunene River marks the border between the two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technical committee insisted, apparently at Namibia's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">urging, that a much larger dam site should also be included in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">final stage of the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee instructed the feasibility consultants to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continue their research on a site which would flood nearly 400km2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the Himba's land - affecting at least 2 000 people and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">destroying 160 ancestral graves and archaeological sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The larger site would also swamp the Epupa waterfalls tourist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attraction and have a much greater impact on the downstream</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a public consultation meeting two weeks ago it emerged that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Swedish and Norwegian governments, which have pumped the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">equivalent of R26-million into the study, will not fund the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigations into the second larger site, officially because of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;budget constraints&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result Namibia and Angola have agreed to find an extra R3-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million needed to research the viability of the larger dam site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local press reports have alleged that the Namibian government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is insisting on the site at Epupa because it wants &quot;a prestige</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project&quot; which means having a massive dam regardless of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">objections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imker Hoogenhout, a spokesman for the technical committee, said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the larger site has been added because the smaller Baynes option</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would be highly dependent on the proper functioning of the Gove</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dam in southern Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gove was badly damaged during the Angolan war and has not yet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been fully repaired. Hoogenhout maintains that because of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">uncertainties over peace in Angola, it is too risky to concentrate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">solely on the Baynes site and therefore another option is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feasibility study group is due to make a final</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recommendation later this year and if it gives the go-ahead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">construction could start before the end of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian government says the 300 megawatt power plant and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dam are necessary to make Namibia energy self-sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists opposing the dam argue that the government would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do better to concentrate on the offshore Kudu gas field and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">alternative energy sources to meet the rising demand for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upping the political ante surrounding the project DTA vice-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">president Katuutire Kaura has claimed that it would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unconstitutional for the government to take communal land from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Himba. He argues that under the country's supreme law, a council</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of traditional leaders which would include Himba chiefs should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advise the president on the use of communal land. The council has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not been convened since independence in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a counter move Swapo supporters in favour of the Epupa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project have called for a referendum in the Kunene region to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decide if the hydropower plan should go ahead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government sources in Harare have been upbeat about the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">swelling by 250 000 a year. But Zimbabwe's leadership has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sending mixed signals on whether it really wants foreign</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many respects things are looking up. Reserve Bank governor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leonard Tsumba has forecast 4,9% growth this year. But while a</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the problem in London remains one of perception as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">businessmen challenged Mugabe on fundamentals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent interviews Mugabe has spoken of former colonisers</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are going back to Zim in their droves, reports Iden Wetherell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Rhodesians are coming! Thousands of citizens of rebel prime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">minister Ian Smith's former white bastion who fled majority rule</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in 1980 to seek refuge in apartheid South Africa are now flocking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">back across the border. And they appear to be escaping the same</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">realities that precipitated their hasty exit from Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic South Africa's embrace of affirmative action is seen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a key factor in propelling many ex-&quot;Rhodies&quot; back across the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limpopo. But in addition to no longer feeling wanted in their</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">former sanctuary, there is the lure of easy money back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, which in recent years has opened up its economy, now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provides lucrative prospects in business, especially for those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with capital outside the country. And while black empowerment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rhetoric is strong, the private sector remains largely in white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hands operating in places on an extensive old-boy network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many returning ex-Rhodesians bring business skills and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment plans, they are by no means universally welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the Nazi war criminals who went to South America never</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dreamt of coming back as they would have been tried for crimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against humanity,&quot; complained the Sunday Mail, a ruling Zanu-PF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">party mouthpiece, &quot;the Rhodesians who aided and abetted acts of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">atrocities against the black population are on the contrary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">singing 'Home Sweet Home' &quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration department has said it is processing an average</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">100 applications a month from South Africa. In December the number</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shot up to 393. This includes an unspecified number of South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans who see their future in Zimbabwe where whites number 80</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">000 in a total population of 11- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economic situation in Zimbabwe still favours the white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community and that is why South Africans find it easier to come</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and live here because they can still be in control,&quot; a senior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government official told the local press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No figures are given for the number of applications that are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rejected but it is believed applicants who served in certain units</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Smith's security forces are unlikely to get back in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994 the supreme court upheld the government's refusal to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grant automatic return to people who were born in Zimbabwe but had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">renounced their citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, for those who make it life is good. &quot;It's definitely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">slower here but much more relaxed,&quot; said &quot;Max&quot; who asked to remain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">anonymous. &quot;There are no carjackings, the weather is better and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people are much friendlier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Max, who left Zimbabwe in 1980 and worked for 15 years in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg, now runs his own advertising company. He said many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of his friends had also returned, some of them feeling they had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reached a glass ceiling in their workplaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The return of the emigr' Rhodesians coincides with a growing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">self-confidence - some would say arrogance - on the part of many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white Zimbabweans who no longer feel overawed by a government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whose record on economic management is attracting growing</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maun - A NEW initiative by the Botswana government to remove</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bushmen from their ancestral lands in the Central Kalahari Game</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reserve - to make way for tourism and mining - has backfired, with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hundreds of Bushmen agreeing to accept cash in return for moving,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but then changing their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People think they are being given big money, it is said it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be enough for one person to buy two new cars. This is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">true,&quot; says a disgusted Aaron Johannes, a member of Kgeikani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kweni, The First People of the Kalahari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannes says one family of 13 has already moved out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mothomelo, one of seven villages in the reserve which is home to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about 3 000 people according to Bushmen - although official</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">figures estimate the population is 1 300.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of people signed up for the scheme initially, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apparently now have changed their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reserve was set up in 1961 for &quot;wild Bushmen&quot;, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">villagers say the Botswana government now wants to turn the place</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into a big safari camp and develop mining in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has sent young people to take down the names of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">those who want to move,&quot; explains Johannes. &quot;We will help and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">support those who want to stay. Now we are always in the game</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reserve because sometimes if we are not, people are told bad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">things. They are told the army will shoot them if they don't move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now people are afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana's government has always maintained that no one is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being forced to relocate. But last February, when new resettlement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plans were announced, villagers were told that if they didn't move</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">out, they would no longer receive social services and that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xade school and clinic would not be upgraded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the words of one official, &quot;infrastructure in the game</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reserve will be left ... but there won't be any more because the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">population will be going down&quot;. To many observers this was just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">another form of removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a government statement last February, the majority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of people in the reserve were &quot;in favour of resettling outside&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But testimonies from five people who attended a series of public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">meetings tell another story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What worries me is this: I, myself, cannot be removed from my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ancestral homes with my people,&quot; said Roy Sesana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government wants us to remain detribalised in order for us to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">come and work for others and live lives of poverty and suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling back my culture, a lion was a friend of mine. Why today is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a lion to be given more development and I not given the same?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villagers have long maintained that the government is merely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bribing them to go, and in some cases harassing them in order to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drive them away. They claim in the past 10 years numerous Bushmen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have been arrested for hunting violations, and have been jailed,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beaten and tortured for being &quot;poachers&quot;. Such allegations have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">also been reported by Amnesty International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the pioneering work of the late John Hardbattle which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">really brought world attention to the fate of the people within</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the reserve. Hardbattle, who was the director of Kgeikani Kweni,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">worked tirelessly canvassing for international support for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalahari Bushmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sponsored by the First Nations Development Institute in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States, in 1995 he travelled to Washington and New York</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where he was christened &quot;The Bushman's advocate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1996 he flew to Geneva where, in two five-minute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sessions before the United Nations High Commission on Racism,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardbattle told the world that people would be removed from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reserve by cattle trucks in May. Before he had finished speaking,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">60 copies of his presentation had been snapped up. Shortly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">afterwards the British House of Lords entered the fray and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demanded that the removal be formally protested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Botswana government was not amused by the uproar, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardbattle was accused in Botswana's Parliament of acting in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;clandestine manner&quot;. He died last November.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her mood is thunderous as we discuss the council's plan to shut</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">quizzically. &quot;Nothing to do with me,'' she replies coyly to my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unasked question. I'm not entirely convinced. She is wearing shell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and cowhide jewellery (which smells pretty foul) given to her by a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spiritualist from the Ivory Coast. &quot;I wear them when I'm feeling</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says racism is behind the campaign to drive her out of Dunkeld</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White people see things in a different perspective. Many are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scared to have our culture so near. There is a white social club</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">next door and no one complains. There are also two brothels just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up the road, but they too are white and therefore culturally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">acceptable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't understand how they can forget so fast. Does rainbow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nation mean that we have to adopt their ways? Where is the spirit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of reconciliation Mandela talks about?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of her neighbours in this traditionally white area have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been petitioning for two years to have Mama's ousted from its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">luxury setting, tucked among other service-related businesses on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan Smuts Avenue. They say it is a noisy shebeen and should not be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowed in a residential area. Some are worried Mama's presence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will drive down property prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a shebeen. It's a private social club,'' snaps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modjadji, her long braided hair swirling around her neck as she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pivots to survey the scene. &quot;Where have you ever seen a shebeen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with a pool and 10 rooms - including private suites, restaurants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and a conference room? In fact, there is more noise from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">street than the club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club may be upmarket (membership is R500), but everyone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">knows you only have to get a small group of black folks together</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and their boisterous enjoyment of life can sound like rowdy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">football supporters after their team has won a major championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I certainly would not like to live nearby, but then I am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exceptionally noise- sensitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its opening in 1994, when Hugh Masekela played live in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the garden, Mama's has risen to almost cult status as the place to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hang out for returned exiles, ex- soldiers, Inkatha people,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">foreign embassy officials and many government members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale (a close friend of Modjadji since</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her youth) is a frequent visitor and Labour Minister Tito Mboweni</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">even has a special room set aside for him and his guests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club's interior is like someone's living room, though the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dim red lights give it a slightly seedy air. Maroon is the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dominant colour, lending the place a down- market Indian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">restaurant look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mama's is for everyone. It's about South Africa's tradition of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hospitality, but people feel more comfortable aligning it with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shebeen, which is an illegal drinking tavern - this is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">illegal. I'm deliberately being messed about by racists who don't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">want to mix. What they are really saying is that our culture is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not welcome in their cosy suburbs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvula &quot;Charmaine&quot; Mapula Modjadji was born in Payneville, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">township on the gold reef surrounding Johannesburg. She moved to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soweto in 1972 after taking up journalism with The World</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">newspaper, forerunner to the Sowetan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though untrained and fresh out of high school, she persuaded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the editor she could write feature articles, soon becoming a star</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contributor to the women's page. Apartheid was at its height and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the northern suburbs were as unknown to her as a foreign country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wasn't legally allowed to visit white suburbs and so didn't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">know them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her first visit to the home of a white liberal colleague was a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">revelation: &quot;I was stunned and could not understand how a family</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of five could live in such a big house with so many rooms.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her traditional box-like four-room township family house had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only two bedrooms. Here she grew up with four siblings, her mother</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a domestic servant) and grandmother. &quot;It was my grandmother who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">showed me that the strength, power and determination of one person</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can make a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a year in journalism, Modjadji put her natural beauty and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">slim figure to use in modelling. She won the Miss Black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg beauty pageant and landed the coveted assignment as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the first black woman to have her face plastered on an advertising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">billboard - for Lux beauty soap - in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year later Modjadji moved into the rag trade as public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relations representative and then buyer for a major clothing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outlet, winning it big business from black communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was followed by a stint in the music business, working for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner Bros as a marketing manager until 1979, and several months</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a beauty consultant for Flora Roberts cosmetics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then won her biggest prize: a United Nations scholarship to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunter College in New York City. She has a BA degree in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">communication and a master's degree in film and music from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of California at Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her time in the United States included four years in Hawaii,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before she returned to South Africa in 1993 because she &quot;wanted to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be part of the changes taking place in my homeland&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But returning home after 16 years of self- imposed exile, she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says the attitudes of many racists have not changed, and that is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">why many black people will not move to the suburbs. &quot;They believe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they don't belong, and this case shows they have a point. I'm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">basically being told I can only live among whites if I play by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their rules.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wants a place where people can pitch up any time, in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tradition of shebeens in black areas, which are usually situated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the heart of residential areas - rather in the same way Britain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has pubs on just about every street corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why should I not be able to have a club in the suburb? The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Group Areas Act no longer exists. This place has zoning rights for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a social club, so technically I'm not breaking the law ... It's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the blackness that is a problem.&quot; She plans to discuss the issue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on next Monday's Felicia Mabuza- Shuttle Show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modjadji applied for a social club licence when she opened in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1994, but before the tribunal had made its ruling the council had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obtained a court order shutting her down. The tribunal later</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rejected her application and she is to appeal on March 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was told I had to be living here while the application for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consent to use it as a club was being considered. So I sold my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">house in Randburg and signed a lease, with the option to buy after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was supposed to be a pilot scheme: &quot;I have international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investors ready to fund a franchise of similar clubs across the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country. But I can't take anyone's money when the ship is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">smelling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She points out much of that end of Jan Smuts Avenue has already</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been zoned for business. &quot;The council's propaganda is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concentrating on noise, blowing things out of proportion; they act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as if what I'm doing is illegal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mickey Baloyi, product development manager for Johnnie Walker,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is a supporter and regular customer: &quot;This place is like a bridge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between two cultures. It's a home away from home for blacks who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have moved into previously white suburbs. It's also a place where</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business deals are made.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the neighbours are not impressed. One allegedly told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modjadji he would spend every penny he has to shut her down. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been trying to sell his house for more than a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modjadji, who has a 25-year-old son and a nine-month-old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grandchild, says it is clear &quot;there is a concerted effort by those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representing white business interests to ensure that I don't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operate within 'their' territory. I suggest they wake up to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">realisation that they now have to share this land more equally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The queen has spoken.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE government is trying to revive the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential Review Commission, created to help reform the ailing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">public sector but paralysed by its own problems, which culminated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recently in the resignation of its chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Bax Nomvete, who by all accounts had a stormy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relationship with the rest of the commission, has refused to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comment on his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining commission members last weekend met Dr Paseka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncholo, the director general of public services and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">administration, in an attempt to shore up the commission and to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rethink its mission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, which was due to present President Nelson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela with its recommendations for revamping the public service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in August, will ask for another 12 months to finish the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Services and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncholo and commission members reportedly want to replace Nomvete</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with Dr Vincent Maphai, a member of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consultative committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission was created to shake up the public service,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which has long been viewed as bloated, backward and inefficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none of the R12-million committed by foreign donors to pay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for its work has been spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has been hampered instead by administrative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hitches and in-fighting between its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skweyiya, under pressure to show results, allegedly threatened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to close the commission last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member told the Mail &amp; Guardian: &quot;People remain seriously</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demoralised about the commission's performance.&quot; Prior to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weekend's gathering, it had looked dead in the water, the member</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past six months, the commission has held a two-day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">methodology workshop, a round-table discussion in November to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">establish a working relationship with its taskteams and a further</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">workshop with members of the Commonwealth Secretariat. It has done</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more than 500 hours of work in 13 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission will have to co-ordinate its investigations with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the new Public Service Commission, to be set up later this year,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because it will be tackling the same task with similar terms of</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Aliens are arrested and imprisoned without</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consideration for their rights, reports Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RAPHAEL MAVUDZI was not the first visitor to South Africa from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">north of the border to fail to have his papers in order. Nor was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he the first to be arrested for that failure, under the Aliens</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Control Act, and thrown into the dismal holding cells of the Sea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Point police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unlike the six men packed into the tiny cell with him,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">waiting for the police to take some action, Mavudzi, a respected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sculptor from Zimbabwe, knew he had the right to a lawyer. And a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">series of phone calls from friend to friend brought Cape Town</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attorney Gary Eisenberg to his cell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavudzi, who had been invited to South Africa in April by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartel Arts Trust in Durban, had been in police custody for two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">days by the time Eisenberg got to him, following a tip-off from a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conditions were appalling and unhygenic,&quot; said Mavudzi at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the weekend, just before he flew home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The blankets were wet with pee and there was garbage on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">floor ... we had to beg them for a broom to sweep it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police did not treat us with dignity. The food was awful -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there were no washing facilities. We had to buy our own drinks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time Eisenberg had got Mavudzi out of the cell, the rest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the men in the cell had signed themselves up as his clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until they had met Mavudzi, none had known they were entitled to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legal counsel, or that they could challenge the law under which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they were held on its lack of constitutionality. Nobody had read</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to the cells and saw a bunch of people in little</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cages,&quot; Eisenberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the people I spoke to had valid holiday permits, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had been arrested on suspicion of working or hawking illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Affairs did not interview the people they were holding in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cells and it is clear from what I saw they do not assess each case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on its own merits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavudzi said negotiations between Eisenberg and the Barrack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Street Home Affairs Department had been slow because they had not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been able to raise anybody on Friday. Most senior officials were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at a party to bid farewell to a senior director, who was leaving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to set up a private immigration consultancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between cellphone calls to Home Affairs officials, Eisenberg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">started chatting to Mavudzi about his artwork and soon they were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">swopping notes on cubism, Picasso and the influence of African art</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on European artists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eisenberg offered to provide a R1900 deposit to Home Affairs to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">release Mavudzi - the deposit is supposed to be refunded once</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavudzi crosses the border - and helped Mavudzi buy his airticket</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also gave Mavudzi cash, which Eisenberg said he needed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because he could not return to his wife and son empty-handed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In exchange, Mavudzi sold Eisenberg a sculpture, and left a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">number behind for Eisenberg to sell for him through tourist shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sculptures fetch between R15000 and R30 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavudzi came to South Africa six months ago, invited by art</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gallery curators to conduct stone sculpture workshops with victims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the KwaZulu-Natal war as part of a rehabilitation therapy. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">displayed two sculptures at the Zimbabwe National Gallery in 1993</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and 1994. The acting exhibition director, Rose West, said the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">works were original and differed from curio-type sculptures. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sculptures had been called The Bomb-blast Victim and The Sleep-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">walker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavudzi was to have done a further workshop at the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Gallery in Cape Town this week. But officials had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refused to give him a work permit because he was an artist. He had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to travel instead on a holiday visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very difficult to come to South Africa from Zimbabawe. I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do rehabilitative work with young people of all races and art to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">me has no boundaries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not because I want to leave my country that I'm here, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because I want to expand my knowledge and share my experience with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eisenberg organised the release of the rest of the other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">detainees on condition that they would see themselves out of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country by train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this week that he will make it a habit to check on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">holding cells from time to time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His anger is not directed at the Home Affairs officials, but at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the law that prompts and governs their actions, which he says is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Constitution says nobody can be detained after arrest for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">longer than 48 hours, but the Act allows Home Affairs to detain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">immigrants indefinitely without them being formally charged,&quot; he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Home Affairs officials say they persist in following this rule</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because it is practice although they know about the constitutional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their loyalty is to the carrying out of the law, but since the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">law itself is rotten, this leads to all kinds of irregularities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Home Affairs officials: &quot;We went out of our way to treat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">him in a fair and reasonable manner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they treat &quot;all detainees well&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Guest writer Pippa Green watches the truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission catch fire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE is a monument outside Pretoria's vast municipal complex,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a broken arch of triumph. Its dedication reads: &quot;To all victims of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terrorism.&quot; It stands on the corner of Munitoria, a distinctly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretorian name in a city where names like Cartoria for a major</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">vehicle dealer are common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of the great fire that all but destroyed Munitoria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this week, the two-metre-high block of granite and steel provided</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a convenient place for police to cordon off the pavement to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provide a kind of holding area where the steady stream of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">firefighters could regroup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That day in Munitoria, the Truth and Reconciliation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission's amnesty committee had heard evidence from a white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaans man who provided instant delight to the pens of foreign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists. If you want to fuel a stereotype, look no further</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">than Colonel Marthinus Ras, the man who gave the orders to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">death squad to kill a black Mamelodi policeman, Sergeant Richard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matosi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ras is thick-necked and tight-mouthed - adjectives when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">juxtaposed with the noun &quot;Afrikaner&quot;, as they were recently in an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American magazine, made me chastise the writer who'd put them on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">paper. But there he was, looking like that, telling an incredulous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">amnesty committee that he'd ordered Warrant Officers Jacques</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hechter and Paul van Vuuren to &quot;eliminate&quot; Matosi without so much</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as shuffling the paper on his desk, or looking in a file to see</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what evidence there was that the Mamelodi policeman was an African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Congress agent. And, he says, when Matosi's wife, Irene,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was killed, he didn't even ask why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the day when the lawyer for the five policemen asking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for amnesty reluctantly dropped the word &quot;terrorist&quot;. There was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">little mistaking his disingenuous tone when he asked ANC MP, Moss</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chikane, whether Dr Fabian Ribeiro, another victim of the Hechter-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Vuuren team, had treated &quot;freedom fighters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then that night outside Munitoria, as blue and orange</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flames exploded the aluminium window frames on the north side of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the building, intelligence agents of the new government gathered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">around the Victims of Terrorism monument without noticing it,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wondering perhaps what kind of terrorism they were dealing with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">now. The documents of the truth commission, they asked, where</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exactly are they?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they watched the flames leap and curl, Gerrie van Niekerk, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">young man from the Pretoria Fire Department, was battling his way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through thick smoke up to the fifth floor on the northern side of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the building to make sure the flames did not jump across to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">part where the amnesty committee was sitting. While he was there,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in swirling grey smoke that blinded him, a roar rumbled through</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the building - like an earthquake, he said afterwards, and he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">didn't know where it was coming from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerrie van Niekerk, like Ras, speaks Afrikaans as a home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">language. His neck is not thick. His mouth is not tight. His eyes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are a wide-open blue, of the sort that people admire in children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he does, he says, he does for the community, and he's proud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to do it. But that night he trembled, as much as a man can tremble</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a sweltering fire-suit, and thought of his baby daughter, as he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">realised the &quot;earthquake&quot; was the floors above him collapsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broken arch of triumph outside the Munitoria Building</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">represents humanity, human life cut short, or so says its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">explanation. Ras was the last to give evidence before the amnesty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">committee in Munitoria that afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the light outside paled, Ras explained how his superior, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">divisional commissioner of police, a Brigadier Stemmet, had told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">him to order the Hechter- Van Vuuren duo to cut short the life of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a man the state called an enemy. It wasn't so much the act of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elimination - to use a police euphemism - that directed the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">questions from Brian Currin, the lawyer for the families, or the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">amnesty judges - but the fact that he had given the orders on one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scrap of hearsay evidence that Matosi was an ANC agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currin put the question: &quot;If you'd been given that sort of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">information about anyone else, you would have been quite happy to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">say, that's fine, eliminate?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ras answered in Afrikaans: &quot;I would have, but I myself would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have made sure that he was an enemy of the state, and then I would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have executed the operation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you were a police officer, not a judge and not an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">executioner.&quot; Currin puts this as a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is so, but we did not live in normal circumstances, Mr</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You get asked on a flimsy bit of information to provide a hit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">squad and kill a man,&quot; says Judge Andrew Wilson to the large man</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the witness chair who is showing only the slightest prickling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of sweat. &quot;No written instructions, no other information. How is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it that a policeman of your standing can act in this way,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colonel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such snippets of information came often to the security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">branch, and I saw this piece as one .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You gave the instructions to kill this man,&quot; says an impatient</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson, his voice rising. &quot;You are responsible for the death of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this man and his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ras sighs, a long heavy sigh. &quot;That is so, Mr Chairman. I'm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">responsible because I said to them that there's a request from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">divisional commissioner that this man must be killed and they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Hechter and Van Vuuren) must do the work.&quot; After the job, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">matter was not spoken about again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Matosis' young son, a boy who had just passed babyhood at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the time his parents were killed, wailed all night beside the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bodies of his dead parents. When Ras is done, the amnesty judges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">go home. So do the victims' families, the truth commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials, the policemen, the lawyers. Everyone except my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indefatigable radio colleagues go home. They settle down to work</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Ras's testimony, and Antjie Samuels, my colleague, has just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finished her script when the fire alarms go off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heaviness and trauma of Ras's testimony is quickly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forgotten in the hysterical jollity that often surrounds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disasters.We stand on the street as flames from the northern block</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the building lick their way through it, crumpling metal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">windows, collapsing concrete, exploding the methane gas in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">air-conditioning system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuels and another radio reporter, Angie Kaplianis, are street</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">celebrities. The local newspaper takes their picture. The head of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the buildings' security, a carelessly cheerful Brian Williams,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says that they can move the hearings and then, when the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intelligence agents rush in with cellphones and worried</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expressions, they want to talk to them, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus of attention is on those outside and on the flames</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that are beginning to leap across from the block where they have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">eaten up the licensing and water and electricity departments to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the main block where the amnesty committee is sitting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one, though, seems then to notice the steady lines of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">firefighters entering the building, half of which is now a great</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">red and blue wall of flame. Dark figures holding hosepipes stand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the roof of the burning section of building, aiming water jets,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in seeming futility, against sheets of flames that are at least</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two stories high. A pisdraatjie (a piddle), says Williams</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cheerily. Actually the firefighters say they used 50 000 cubic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">litres of water a second. Over the 15-odd hours they battled the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flames, that's nearly 50-million cubic litres. A thousand swimming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pools-worth for those who live in the suburbs, a dam for those who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other fire departments screech in to help the embattled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria firefighters: from Midrand, from Sandton, from the air</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">force and the army. By the next morning, fire departments from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">East Rand are also there. The firefighters - young men just out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their teens for the most part - traipse into the milky white smoke</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the southern block which is not yet burning. One falls off the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collapsing roof as he struggles up with a hose and hurts his back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several lie on the roadside, quietly gasping for breath, but no-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one except ambulance men talk to them. Two soot-faced spluttering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">firefighters, battling to get the smoke out of their lungs, ask</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaplianis for her last two cigarettes. She hands them over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks,&quot; they say. &quot;Ons soek asem. (We need breath).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After midnight, we follow a train of thirsty-looking people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">down the steps of an escalator. We step off on to the edge of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beachsand and a mural of swaying palm-trees with a sign saying,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coconut Club. A lithe - but I mean lithe - dark-haired girl in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a silver bikini walks out of the club, filled with fake swirls of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">smoke and throbbing red lights, to see the real thing across the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">road. The Pretoria patrons jump and jive to a doof-doof version of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alanis Morissette: &quot;And I'm here to remind you, of the mess you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">left when you went away ...&quot; Thinking the ever-helpful Williams</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">needs a break, we tell him about the girl in the silver bikini in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the club, and he says, no, he's not &quot;lus vir meisies in costumes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nie (He does not fancy girls in swimming costumes)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before two in the morning, the wind comes up and the fire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leaps the barriers that the fire-soldiers have battled to place in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the southern block. It sweeps in a zig-zag through the top floor,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">then the next one, then the one after that, like a sharp knife</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cutting through canvas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Niekerk is on the fifth floor, three floors below the fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission's documents are six floors below. Misjudging</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the firefighters' ability, I assume they're gone. I do not know</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">then that there are still firefighters on almost every floor of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the burning building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the light of the next day, when the flames are doused, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the smoke is still billowing, I see the truth commission's Koki</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpshe walk out of the building in fireman's overalls carrying two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">briefcases full of documents. The transcripts of the amnesty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hearings are in there, safe. Ras's words have not burnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see also Van Niekerk, who is now into the 33rd hour of his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shift. Van Niekerk has been a fireman since the age of 17. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feels proud, he says, to be a fireman, to do something for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community. This was a towering inferno, he says, and it was just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">great to be here. You have to be cool to be a fireman, he says,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">even in a hot fire-suit that sends your heartbeat up from 80 to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">150 beats a minute. And then there's the 19kg oxygen pack and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tramping up and down stairs dragging fire hoses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But things aren't quite as simple. He recalls what happened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when the roof above him collapsed. the smoke in front of him was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white-grey. The heat was intense - some say up to 50000 degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had one vision when the roof collapsed above him. &quot;I saw my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">child's face,&quot; he says. A girl, he says, crying openly, five</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">months old, and then he can't say any more. His eyes are reddened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by smoke and tears. He talks about his colleagues, about the new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">councillors that have thanked them for doing their duty, about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adrenaline that pumped through him the night before. He does not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">keep any silences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young, white Afrikaner, he stood his ground on the fifth</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE Durban High Court ruled this week that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela has the right, if he chooses, to appoint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">biased and partial commissions of inquiry, and that citizens have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">no legal recourse to oppose them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling by Judge Ron McLaren followed the leak of documents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from a secret October 1996 meeting between Education Minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibusiso Bengu, four members of the University of Durban-Westville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(UDW) council and Durban attorney Linda Zama. Zama is a member of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the commission of inquiry appointed last May to investigate unrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the UDW campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents, described by the court as &quot;aides-memoires&quot;,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suggested that the participants planned to use the recent problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the university to justify ministerial involvement in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appointment of a new vice- chancellor. They also mention</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">establishing an &quot;intelligence network&quot; on the campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UDW's Combined Staff Association (Comsa) and nine other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individuals, including six Comsa members and three students, had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gone to court seeking an interdict to prevent Zama from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participating in the commission, arguing that her participation in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the meeting was &quot;unlawful&quot; and suggested her role in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission was not impartial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But delivering judgment after a tense day of argument, Judge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McLaren dismissed the application with costs, saying the court</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;has no power to interfere with the composition of the commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or to grant the relief sought by the applicants&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge McLaren said in his judgment that &quot;it is the prerogative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the state president to decide who to appoint to a commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the commission is comprised of non-impartial members, it is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the status of the commission which will suffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers said the judgment was likely to cause renewed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conflict on campus after six months of calm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comsa's counsel Archie Findlay, SC, argued that the interim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitution --- applicable when the commission was formed in May</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996 --- assured citizens a right to &quot;lawful and fair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">administrative action&quot; against the absolute nature of presidential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prerogative held by previous governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the court heard that Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's absence had signed the proclamation appointing the UDW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission, had invoked the 1947 Commissions Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act enshrined presidential prerogative with respect to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operation of the commission and its terms of reference. Only the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">office of the president could determine whether such a commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was bound by the Constitution or other rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting historical cases, Zama's counsel, Malcolm Wallis, SC,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said the nature of presidential commissions of inquiry was such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that they were not legally binding judicial bodies, and that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constitutional protections demanded by Comsa did not apply to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their operation. The commission was &quot;merely an advisory body to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the executive&quot; and its functions were therefore not open to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">judicial review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge McLaren further accepted Wallis's contention that Comsa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and its fellow applicants had failed to prove that their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">application was &quot;urgent&quot;, or that Zama's conduct, or the contents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the secret meeting, were &quot;sinister&quot; or in any way compromised</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the work of the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Zama) gave unchallenged evidence that she told (Bengu) she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">did not want to discuss the manner in which the commission does</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its work ... she said 'I deny that I have a pre- determined</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policy, perception and agenda with respect to the university ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My involvement at UDW and in the commission is dispassionate and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">professional,'&quot; Judge McLaren said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge added that even if he did have the power to grant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relief in terms of the application, he &quot;would not exercise that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">power in (the applicants') favour&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the application as &quot;ill-founded&quot;, he suggested that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comsa should give evidence to the commission in terms of subpoenas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">issued to several of the applicants the commission has accused of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">criminal and/or disciplinary offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comsa has boycotted the commission since its inception and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">within weeks of the commission's appointment sent letters to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission chair Johann Gautschi and Mandela alleging Zama and co-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commissioner Jerry Coovadia could not be impartial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the court ruling, Comsa said: &quot;While the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitution of South Africa gives us certain rights and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">protections, the court refused to help us ... The struggle to keep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political interference out of education has begun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bengu this week blamed &quot;a small element&quot; of people for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trying to dislodge the commission and said this was &quot;because they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have something to hide&quot;. He denied the meeting had been &quot;secret&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and claimed the minute-taker had been &quot;creative&quot; in his record of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UDW vice-rector Pitika Ntuli said it was ironic that the campus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had been the &quot;most united in its entire career&quot; in the week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">preceding the exposure of the secret meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then the document hit our desks with the suggestion of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possibility of the creation of a network of spies, with serious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">questions for academic freedom. To even suggest such a thing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">raises a spectre we have just emerged from in the dark days of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apartheid. After months of building a united front between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">students, Comsa and management, that document has come like a bolt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from hell's kitchen, barbequeing our hopes for this campus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Natal constitutional law professor Kathie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Govender, who is also a member of the Human Rights Commission,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said the courts had been divided on the issue of presidential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prerogative in the post-1994 era, with two judges coming to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposing conclusions in separate cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What one is saying is there is an area of executive competence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which is beyond the constitution,&quot; she said. &quot;I'd have been safer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with a ruling that says the court does have jurisdiction to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constrain the president's actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A series of sensational allegations against SABC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bosses about a top-selling TV show will result in arbitration,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reports Peta Thornycroft</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE heads of SABC1 and 2 have been accused of illegally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">removing property from the offices of an independent television</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">producer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of a series of sensational allegations involving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prominent television and media personalities that will be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arbitrated by advocate Gilbert Marcus, SC, later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent producer Johanna Makgalemele has asked for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arbitration over the termination of her contract with the SABC for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her series Women on the Move. The only official explanation the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC has given is in a letter to Makgalemele: &quot;As a result of all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the problems which were experienced with the first 13 episodes no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decision has been taken regarding any further episodes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents in the possession of the SABC allege Thandi Thaninga-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Msimango, head of SABC2, and Molefe Mokgatle, boss of SABC1,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ordered a raid on the offices of Makgalemele in November last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The saga began last August when Johanna Makgalemele, sister of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">former Miss South Africa Basetsana Makgalemele, presented a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proposal to SABC 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept was accepted and a contract entered into between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johanna Makgalemele's company and the SABC to produce 52 episodes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the Women on the Move series. Makgalemele was to produce and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">present each 26-minute episode. After the first 13 had been made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and had attracted excellent advertising and top audience ratings,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the SABC informed Makgalemele she was to make no more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arbitration hearing will have access to letters written by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makgalemele; a former employee of hers, Lloyd Power; Msimango; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media personality and editor of Enterprise magazine Thami Mazwai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai was not a party to the contract for Women on the Move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet he wrote to his friend Msimango saying women interviewed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the series had been &quot;humiliated&quot;. Shortly afterwards,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makgalemele learnt from the SABC she would be making no more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">episodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai's only involvement in the series was an offer of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">research --- to identify women who were making it in various</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fields. In return, he was given valuable publicity. Mazwai's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">magazine featured prominently in several of the interviews and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">according to some in the production team, Makgalemele became</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">increasingly irritated by his alleged interference and his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">magazine's repeated exposure in a series in which he was not a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contractual party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power, a hairdresser-turned-television- producer, wrote to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makgalemele with a long list of grievances and resigned from her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">company on November 26 after the first few episodes were in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For reasons which are not clear from the file of documents at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the SABC, Power also sent a copy of his letter of resignation to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Msimango at SABC2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later, according to documents in the SABC's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possession, Power went to Makgalemele's offices in Houghton,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg and seized documents, film tapes, a computer, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other items including a petty cash cheque. Power has written a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statement claiming he did this on the orders of Msimango and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokgatle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter signed by Esthea du Toit from the legal department,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the SABC has acknowledged it has some of Makgalemele's possessions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but says it is making sure none of the items seized belong to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series Women on the Move, now renamed Lebone and with new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">presenters, continues to be shown on Monday nights on SABC2 with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sets remarkably like those which belonged to Makgalemele. Credits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the end of the programme list LP Productions as the producers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Power's and Enterprise magazine's names appear as integrally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involved in the series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai has made it widely known he now wishes to become</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contractually involved in the lucrative series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian made every effort to get a comment from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai on Wednesday evening, and on Thursday morning read him the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">section of the report where he is named. The whole report was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">faxed to his office for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said on Thursday: &quot;You should have given me time to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are serious allegations. I am in the middle of a meeting ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am in Cape Town. You are being unprofessional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether he was contractually involved in any way with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">series, he said: &quot;This doesn't give the whole picture. I cannot do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business this way.&quot; And he hung up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC's general manager for corporate communications Enoch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sithole said: &quot;We will not comment now, there is a process of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigation going on and there are two sides of the story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The publicity department of the SABC said it was unable to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supply photographs of Msimango without permission from Sithole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makgalemele is understood to have asked SABC to restore the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">series to her and for compensation for losses incurred since it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was reassigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makgalemele has been advised by her legal team to make no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comment to the press until the arbitration is over.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">application to be released from prison - known as a habeas corpus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">application - and his appeal against a ruling last year by the Bow</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a question of if, it's when ...'' said an official</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who has been working on the case from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill's return would give the Reserve Bank the chance to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prosecute the country's most ambitious foreign-exchange fraud case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to date. Hill is alleged to have manipulated South Africa's dual</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">currency system with forged Eskom bond certificates, earning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">himself at least R100-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He fled to London in 1987 to evade the charges and spent the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">next nine years in luxurious exile at 1 Belgravia Square. Hill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last year handed control of local financial magazine Finance Week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to former Financial Mail editor-at-large David Gleason for an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undisclosed sum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill still has a few legal avenues open which would allow him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to postpone his return. Despite the court denying him leave to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeal to the House of Lords, Hill can petition the house directly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the next 14 days - in the same way that South Africans can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">petition the state president if a judge denies them leave to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeal to the Appellate Division in Bloemfontein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If his direct petition fails, the British Home Secretary will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sign a certificate authorising his expulsion from Britain and Hill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be flown back to South Africa. Hill could also appeal against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this executive decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that fails, South African lawyers working on the case say he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could approach the European Court, but it is understood this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeal would not suspend the British ruling: Hill could be sent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">back to South Africa with his European appeal pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Hill's legal team have argued that the fraud charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relate to exchange control regulations, the breach of which is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an extraditable offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An associate of Oshy Tugendhaft, a senior partner at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg law firm Moss Morris, and Hill's longtime lawyer,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gun? Mungo Soggot reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE feud between Times Media Limited and former employee David</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason exploded into the public domain this week, as TML's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Day newspaper published long- rumoured allegations about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason's ethical behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper on Wednesday published a carefully worded but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wounding article alleging that Gleason had invited Rand Merchant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank (RMB) to encourage him to stop writing a series of critical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">articles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The articles, which Gleason wrote during his stint at TML's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial Mail, related to the RMB and to KwaZulu-Natal water</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">utility Umgeni Water, and provoked a full- scale investigation by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason allegedly told top RMB executives he would stop writing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">if the bank favoured mining house Randgold in a mooted deal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concerning Gold Fields of South Africa. He wrote a number of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">articles about Randgold for the Financial Mail, and often critical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">articles of Gold Fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason has personal friends and business associates on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randgold board, and refuses to confirm or deny that certain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randgold directors backed his sensational takeover of Finance Week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason and Financial Mail editor Nigel Bruce quit TML under a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cloud after Gleason bought Finance Week. Up to that point, they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had studiously denied such plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement by RMB executive Wendy Lucas- Bull about a meeting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with Gleason in Cape Town - in the Mail &amp; Guardian's possession -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">quotes Gleason as having said: &quot;As far as I am concerned, RMB</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pushing through the deal (with Randgold) will be enough of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">favour to me personally to stop writing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucas-Bull, who heads Business Against Crime, says Gleason</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opened the meeting with the statement: &quot;If it comes to it I will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deny that this discussion ever took place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement by RMB managing director Paul Harris says, &quot;He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Gleason) said he had damaging information about RMB that he could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continue to write for a long time, but that he would stop doing so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">if I ensured the Randgold deal went through. He said he did not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stand to gain personally from the deal but that he wanted the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transaction to take place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Day's decision to publish follows months of sniping</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between TML and Finance Week, and months of rumours about Gleason</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and RMB. Nigel Bruce claims the documents only came into TML's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possession last week when RMB handed them to his successor at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial Mail, Peter Bruce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this week's Finance Week, Bruce says RMB merely plotted to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discredit Gleason for his Umgeni Water articles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce threatened Business Day with an interdict on Monday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">night, but had not taken any legal action at the time of going to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">press. A junior Business Day journalist read the article to Bruce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before it was published.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Week retaliated this week with a lengthy article</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">entitled &quot;RMB's vendetta&quot;. The article focuses mainly on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">background to Gleason's articles about RMB and skirts the ethics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">issue. It says: &quot;RMB has not been able to establish a motive for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason's alleged blackmail. There is no suggestion that he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">received any money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It adds: &quot;The bank ... chose neither to sue for the defamation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it alleges nor to bring a charge for 'blackmail'. Gleason denies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he made the threats attributed to him separately by Harris and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucas-Bull, and has refused invitations to justify his alleged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remarks in the face of a threat of legal proceedings ... This is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sordid matter which neither Gleason nor Bruce would wish to bring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into the public domain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correspondence on the matter last year between RMB, Roy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paulson, then Times Media managing director, and Bruce includes a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">letter from RMB's Harris to Bruce which states: &quot;To allege before</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">getting an explanation from Gleason that Wendy Lucas- Bull and I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">made up the story in order to intimidate Gleason is insulting to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">us. If we were this dishonest we would surely have considered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accepting his proposal. There is absolutely no doubt in our minds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what proposal Gleason put to us and he should confirm it with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris says in another note to Bruce that Gleason's allegation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that Lucas-Bull and Harris &quot;fabricated the story and have lied to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">our lawyers ... is as grave as the original blackmail issue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharon Wapnik of Johannesburg law firm Moss Morris - who also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">handles legal work for former Finance Week owner Oliver Hill - was</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - WHEN Chante Griffin was born in jail six months</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ago with a heart defect, doctors said she needed to be examined at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">least once a week. Her mother, Malina Griffin, says she has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seen only once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin, who is awaiting trial in Diepkloof prison, says she is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being victimised by a warder whose relative was allegedly killed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by her ex-boyfriend. She says Chante is being denied proper</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">medical attention because of the vendetta and she could develop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heart problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elmarie Eygelaar, head of the women's section of the prison,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says a doctor is in attendance every day and Griffin is free to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ask if she thinks her baby needs to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Griffin (30) says the lack of care for her child is not her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only problem with prison authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin has been in Diepkloof since last April, when she was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arrested in connection with a murder and hijacking. For several</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">months her lawyer convinced her she was being held because she was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to be used as a state witness. Recently the attorney general</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decided she would be charged with murder and hijacking. Her trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been set for October 24, meaning she will have been in prison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for a year and a half awaiting trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months now she has been battling to be moved to police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cells or to another prison, to escape what she says is abuse by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other inmates set loose on her by the vindictive warder. She says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">threats have also been made against Chante.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her requests, through her attorney, Pieter Scholtz, have gone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unanswered. Scholtz, hired by the public defender, told the Mail &amp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian he has not taken up Griffin's complaints with the prison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because they were &quot;unsubstantiated&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first attack was in August, by nine prisoners. After that,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin says, she was moved to a cell on her own. Then in October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some of the same inmates smashed her knee cap. After every</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beating, Griffin says, she was warned to say she had fallen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eygelaar said she was not aware of the attacks. She was also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unaware that Griffin wanted to be transferred, and promised to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to her woes, Griffin learnt last week that she faces</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">another 10 months in prison, and that she will be prosecuted with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenneth Fereira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin knew Fereira as Norman Wayne Posthumus, an alias he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">used. She was with him on April 21 1996 when he allegedly hijacked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a car in Brakpan and shot its owner. Fereira, who is also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">represented by Scholtz, has pleaded guilty to all charges , but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin insists she was a helpless bystander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after she arrived at prison, she learnt that the victim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was the uncle of the warder. &quot;I'm so afraid of what might happen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to us. They (some inmates) have beaten me up and they keep telling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">me they will kill my baby because my ex-boyfriend killed the uncle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the sergeant,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Institute for Crime Prevention and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rehabilitation of Offenders (Nicro) has expressed outrage at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin's treatment by her lawyer, the prison service and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicro's Ellie Maas-Weisenberger said Scholtz has neglected his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">client. Griffin says the lawyer has not visited her in prison, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has only met her briefly during court hearings for bail and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maas-Weisenberger also criticised the justice system for taking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;such a long time&quot; to decide whether to prosecute Griffin or use</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her as a witness. She called for the attorney general to review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOUR officials investigated by the Department of Health for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their role in Sarafina II, the ill-fated Aids awareness play that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cost taxpayers several million rands, have escaped with their</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a request by the Mail &amp; Guardian this week,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Department Director General Dr Olive Shisana released</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">details of the steps the department has taken to prevent a replay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the Sarafina fiasco: three officials were cleared of any</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The credibility of the department, and in particular Health</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nkosazana Zuma, was severely strained last year when it</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had agreed to spend R14,2-million on Sarafina II.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The musical, produced by Mbongeni Ngema and his Committed</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selby Baqwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his damning report last May, Baqwa laid much of the blame on</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A RASTAFARIAN is taking the Law Society of Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town to court over its refusal to allow him to qualify as a lawyer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because he has a criminal record for cannabis possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Law Society says it cannot allow Garreth Prince, who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">completed his legal studies at the University of the Western Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in 1995, to apply for a clerkship because he is not &quot;a fit and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proper person to represent the legal fraternity&quot;. Prince was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">convicted of possessing cannabis in 1989 and 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince says he has told his attorneys to take the matter to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law Society director Susan McElvaine says Prince was turned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">down because of the Attorneys Act, which stipulates that a person</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with a criminal record cannot register as a candidate attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Prince says the Law Society has allowed others with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">criminal records to register -- a point confirmed by members of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the legal profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince adds that under the religious freedom provision in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">new constitution he should have the right to smoke cannabis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Ethiopia cannabis is recognised in their official church as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a holy sacrament,&quot; he says. &quot;If they can allow it, surely our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitution should allow the same situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cannabis has never hurt anyone,&quot; he adds. &quot;It is a holy weed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and part of Jah's gifts. I completed my legal studies in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">required amount of years while I smoked it often, which shows that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it does not harm your brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he will take his case as far as the Constitutional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court if necessary, to fight for the right of the entire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rastafarian community in South Africa to &quot;smoke the holy weed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">openly . Ultimately I feel I shouldn't be labelled a criminal for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doing something that is religious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Cape Town constitutional lawyer, who declines to be named,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says the new Constitution probably does allow smoking cannabis for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">religious purposes, but not for any other reason.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - TWO of Johannesburg's elite schools went head-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to-head this week, not on the playing field but in the somewhat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seedier surrounds of the Randburg Magistrate's Court, to settle a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">case of assault, with racial overtones and a sporting twist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case stemmed from a fight at the Randburg Waterfront last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year between two students, one from St Stithians in Randburg, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other from King EdwardVII High School (KES) in Houghton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight left the St Stithians schoolboy with a broken jaw,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the KES boy badly bruised. The whole affair probably would</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have passed into school history, except that the St Stithians boy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">laid a charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against the KES boy who broke his jaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When others got involved in the m-l'e, a second KES student was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">verbally assaulted with the words, &quot;There are lots of blacks in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the world, but you will always be a kaffir.&quot; But it was not a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">factor in the court case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headmasters from both schools -Bruce McMurray of KES and David</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilde of St Stithians -- say the two schools enjoy a good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relationship and that the fight had nothing to do with inter-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">school rivalry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the court heard evidence that long- standing rugby and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sporting rivalry between the two English-speaking schools could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have triggered and fuelled the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boys involved cannot be named because they are under 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was held in camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources involved in the case say the two students crossed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">swords at the Flames Restaurant at the Randburg Waterfront. Asked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the owner to fight it out off the premises, they arranged a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">showdown elsewhere on the Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crowd of about 30, representing both the schools, gathered to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">watch, and on occasion, join in as the two students punched,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">kicked, engaged in head locks and slammed one another's faces into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the concrete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verbal assault came as a black friend of the KES boy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stepped in, prompting another St Stithians boy to utter the racist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two primary opponents were more subdued for their recent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">court appearance. Each was clad in his school blazer and tie, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was accompanied by his father</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus of the case was to examine a parting kick the boy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from KES dealt to his St Stithians opponent, which struck the boy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the face and broke his jaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides agreed on the facts -which emerged in statements and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">under cross- examination - but disagreed about what the KES boy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had intended with the final kick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His defence was that he had not intentionally aimed for his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opponent's face, and could not have aimed because he was being</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attacked from behind and it was dark. The St Stithians boy argued</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the kick had been intentional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end the magistrate ruled that the kick had hit its mark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accidentally. He acquitted the boy of the assault charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the case came to a sporting conclusion as boys from both</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sides - and their fathers -shook hands following the ruling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A fund set up to encourage banks to finance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">housing in high-risk areas has not been used, reports Mungo Soggot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE government agency set up to entice banks into lending money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for housing in high-risk areas has concentrated on areas where it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">admits there is no risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its two years of existence, the Mortgage Indemnity Fund has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not used a cent of the R300-million budget it was given by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government to insure banks against loan defaulting in high-risk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main reason the money remains untouched is that the banks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fund has been working with are operating in areas where there</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is little to no risk that homeowners will default on their loans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fund chief Nkukuleko Sowazi says banks should have been lending in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many of these areas all along, adding their policy of redlining</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had been made &quot;willy nilly'' and without thorough research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sowazi rejected suggestions that the fund was being too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cautious in its attempts to draw banks into black areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Housing Minister Sankie Mthembi-Nkondo says in fact that non-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">use of the fund is an indicator of its success. Its record, she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says, &quot;breaks the myth that this market cannot pay&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fund has to be cautious,&quot; she adds. &quot;It should not be seen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to be grabbing money.&quot; The fund is to be shut down in May, though</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">she hopes to extend its life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund was set up in 1995 as a mechanism to persuade banks to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">approve bonds for houses in what have been considered no-go areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refusal by banks to approve bonds for housing in risky areas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been a key stumbling block to the government's housing drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund has provided indemnity cover to 469 previously</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">redlined areas, resulting in the approval by banks of 91 000 bonds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">worth a total of R6-billion. Sowazi says the fund has also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">blacklisted 65 areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund has a contract with a private company, Social Surveys,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to determine an area's risk before deciding whether to offer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cover. Communities that have been blacklisted are welcome to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeal, Sowazi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian reported last week that the fund had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">angered residents in Meadowlands, Soweto, who say the fund</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">blacklisted an entire zone of Meadowlands because some of its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">residents had been involved in a five-year dispute with three</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute - with ABSA, Perm and Standard Bank - is about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">poor construction of their R60 000 homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents say the banks bear some of the responsibility for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">granting loans for houses they knew were not going to last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite their unhappiness, the residents have continued to pay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they discovered last month that they had been officially</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">redlined the residents complained to the provincial government,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">saying fund official Tlhoriso Thelejane had told them the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">redlining was to pressure the community to stop its &quot;bad apples&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from complaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thelejane initially said his comments were taken out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">context. Sowazi says Thelejane denies saying any of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sowazi also dismisses any suggestion that the fund colluded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the banks to redline the area, though he said the dispute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">probably did affect the area's risk rating.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARD drug use is on the rise in the Western Cape, and only a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fundamental shift in government strategy can stop it, says a new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">report from the Medical Research Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researcher Charles Parry says that drugs such as heroin and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cocaine are flooding into the country through newly opened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">borders, and replacing dagga and mandrax as drugs of choice. And</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">done to stem the tide, he says, the Cape could face an explosion</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we do not integrate the approach, the consequences could be</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parry was particularly concerned about the prospects of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">escalating violence, driven by addiction to drugs that are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expensive and hard to get. Also, latest arrest figures suggest</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE government is to investigate importing Cuban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">teachers to shore up the state school service. Education Minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibusiso Bengu said this week he planned to go to Cuba later this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">month to look at the country's maths and science teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed suggestions that the government's redeployment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">programme - where state teachers were offered new posts or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">retrenchment packages in a drive to equalise resources - had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">robbed the service of its best staff.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cuban initiative instead was targeting South Africa's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expected teaching needs over the next eight years, Bengu claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuba would qualify in the areas of education because they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">produced mass teachers and mass scientists,&quot; he told the Mail &amp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That they succeeded in doing - so they do have surpluses, so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that is a factor we would want to look at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan follows a similar initiative by Health Minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkosazana Zuma, who has drafted in hundreds of Cuban doctors to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fill gaps in poorer provinces' health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teaching unions have warned that the redeployment programme,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">initiated last year, has led merely to thousands of the most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">senior, experienced teachers leaving the profession. Bengu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conceded last month that the programme had weak points. But he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countered the statement this week that there was no scientific</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proof that expertise had been lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bengu also announced this week that he had secured R4,88-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">billion in government subsidies for tertiary education for the new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">financial year - higher than the figure originally agreed with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finance ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous budget would have forced cuts in subsidies to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tertiary education - a threat which prompted recent widespread</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">campus protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that subsidies for universities would stay the same as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last year, except for the five homeland universities whose</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">subsidies would be reduced slightly to the bring them into the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">line with the other tertiary institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Stuart Hess and Mungo Soggot finally got to see</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the report that caused all the trouble</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE dossier which prompted a government inquiry into rugby and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this week's high court battle between rugby supremo Louis Luyt and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports Minister Steve Tshwete contains little more than press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">clippings and court papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents handed to Tshwete by former Transvaal Rugby Football</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union vice- president Brian van Rooyen appear unlikely to trigger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luyt's downfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the 500-page dossier does contain the top-secret</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agreement spelling out the South African Rugby Football Union's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Sarfu) relationship with marketing company Megapro Marketing - a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">company allegedly linked to Luyt - in which Megapro's commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can be up to 25% of Sarfu's revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement, signed in June 1993, says: &quot;The trust hereby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grants Megapro the right to commercially exploit for and on behalf</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the trust all rights held by the trust with regard to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">marketing of the activities of the national teams.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the five-year deal expires, Megapro has the option to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">renew it for another two years. The document also spells out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Megapro's lucrative commission arrangements. It says: &quot;Megapro</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shall be responsible for the collection of all money due as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">result of their marketing activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luyt was only given a copy of the documents on Wednesday,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">following an urgent application to the Pretoria High Court by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarfu and the Transvaal Rugby Union. Tshwete had previously</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refused Luyt's demands for a copy, arguing that the contents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should remain under wraps until the ministry checked the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A task team, headed by sports director general Mthobi Tyamzashe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and including tax guru Michael Katz and former judge Mervyn King,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been established to go through the document. A full-blown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission of inquiry into rugby's affairs hinges on the team's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarfu's annual accounts for the 12 months to September 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">show it paid R3,5-million to Communication Services International</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- apparently a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a commission for the R2-billion Sanzar deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanzar deal was concluded between Luyt and Murdoch in 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and gave Murdoch exclusive television rights to all rugby matches</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the Southern Hemisphere for the next 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration and finance general manager Ivor Bloom said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarfu paid nearly R500 000 in commission to Megapro for other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sponsorships that were arranged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accounts also show that Sarfu spent close to R60-million on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">golden handcuffs which locked national and provincial squad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">members into three-year contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than R33-million was paid to the provinces following the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanzar deal to enable them to contract provincial players for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">three years - until 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another R26,7-million paid to the national squad bought squad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">members' loyalties for three years in the face of Australian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">magnate Kerry Packer's attempts to lure them to his World Rugby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarfu's profit for the year was R18,6- million, which meant it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had to dip into its reserves - income accumulated over years - to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fund the loyalty payouts, which drained the reserves to less than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R6-million, from a previous R20,6-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the organisation, which does not pay corporate tax because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it is supposed to be a non-profit organisation, underpinned its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">figures by claiming nearly R2-million in VAT rebates on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">payments to the provinces and its payments from sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It claimed R4,5-million in VAT rebates from the Receiver of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revenue in 1995, including rebates on the Rugby World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents of a Sarfu meeting last year which were leaked to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">papers last week showed Luyt's son, Louis Luyt Junior, stands to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">earn 10% commission on sponsorship deals he negotiates for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of these deals include Luyt Junior allegedly negotiating to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">take the South African team to Disney World toward the end of this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year - a deal thought to be worth R44-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal would include the South African national team playing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other international sides at Disney World's new sports complex in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orlando, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sarfu said this week that the decision to pay Luyt Junior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission is supported by its executive. &quot;Why should we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discriminate against any person who is successful in securing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">funds for Sarfu through sponsorships?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Or is there a problem, merely because it happens to be Mr Luyt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junior?&quot; executive member Tobie Titus said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luyt Senior, meanwhile, has threatened to sue the Sunday Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after it published details of the commission last week, and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">alleged involvement of other Luyt family members in South African</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - LEADING music concert promoter Attie van Wyk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said this week he wants to bring international actors to South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa in an effort to rejuvenate the country's languishing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">theatre industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed plans to add an International Theatre Division to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his already successful Big Concerts promotions company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be headed by Bernard Jay, entertainment director of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">computerised national booking service Computicket, the theatre</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operation aims to draw some of the biggest names in international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">theatre to South Africa for limited runs of modern plays and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">musicals. Jay has already given notice at Computicket and will be</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leaving in four months' time to join Big Concerts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past few years South Africa has opened up to pop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">music and to sport ... I see no reason why the same can't happen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with theatre,&quot; said Jay this week. &quot;It's time to bring the masses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">back to the theatre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African theatre audiences have dwindled in recent years,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and both he and Van Wyk are convinced the only way they can stop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the rot is to attract the superstar theatre names to the country -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">particularly the movie actors who frequently return to the West</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">End or Broadway to fulfil their love for the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Wyk has been responsible for bringing 40 international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">artists to South Africa, including Tina Turner, Whitney Houston</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Phil Collins. He plans to bring in Michael Jackson later this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year and there is speculation that he will also handle the U2 tour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in October this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kind of names bandied about by Van Wyk and Jay this week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">include Robert de Niro, Al Pacino, Robert Redford, Gene Wilder,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glenn Close and Meryl Streep - all known for their stage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">performances between film projects. Close has recently played a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">season of Sunset Boulevard and De Niro has just come off a small</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">off-Broadway production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this individual star pulling-power, combined with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obligatory local cast, Big Concerts feels it could fill a 1 000-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seat theatre for a few weeks. It would hope to make use of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">existing theatres such as Pretoria's State Theatre and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg's Civic. There are no plans, as yet, to build new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spaces for their envisaged projects, but this week Van Wyk did not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rule out the possibility of developing new theatre property if the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An assortment of weapons and vehicles is missing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'out of stock' from one of the Western Cape's largest military</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bases, reports Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE than 100 firearms, including assault rifles, have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disappeared from one of the Western Cape's largest military bases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military documents handed to the Mail &amp; Guardian show the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Defence Force (SANDF) discovered last July that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the weapons were missing from the Youngsfield military base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military police are still trying to trace them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missing arms fuel fears that SANDF weapons are finding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their way into the hands of criminals. Allegations have also been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">made that such weapons often end up with militant rightwingers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a signal message, a secret military memo, drafted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by a Corporal CB Oerson and dated September 20 1996, weapons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">missing &quot;out of stock&quot; from the Western Province Maintenance Unit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">include 103 7,7mm rifles, seven R-1 rifles, five 5,56mm assault</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rifles, a 9mm pistol and a &quot;riot- type&quot; Beretta shotgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message also said a Land-Rover and truck were missing from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the unit. The Land- Rover was signed out to the army's auction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">centre in October 1995, but the centre had no record that it had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arrived, and refused to verify that it had been sent to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report from the commanding officer of the unit, Lieutenant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willem Theron, says the &quot;outstanding problem&quot; in his unit &quot;could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not be solved&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SANDF failed to respond to queries this week. But part of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its investigation involves pinning the blame on a Youngsfield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">staff sergeant who died in a car accident in November 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the missing arms connected to the dead man - Izak Brand -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do not correlate with those detailed in the signal message. Brand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been blamed for the disappearance of 51 rifles and an unknown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">amount of ammunition allegedly sold to people with Afrikaans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">surnames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major Johannes Theart, appointed to investigate irregularities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in weapon sales from Youngsfield, says in a report dated May 2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996 that &quot;large amounts of ammunition were sold. In some cases up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to 1 000 rounds were sold to one person during January 1995, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more later. No proof could be found that the money was paid. I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">phoned a few of the members to whom weapons and ammunition were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sold and they said that cash was handed to Brand and that they did</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not have receipts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Brand has received a letter of demand from the state</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attorney for R14 335 from her husband's estate to cover the cost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the missing arms and ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says Brand's former comrades claim he is being framed for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the missing arms, and she is refusing to pay. She is seeking more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">information from the SANDF about the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My husband gave his heart and soul to the army. He gave them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16 years of his life, neglecting his wife and family for them. But</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">today no one in the army will protect his memory,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has a letter from her husband's former commanding officer,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">valued member of this unit of whom you can be very proud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Brand said: &quot;I don't understand how he could be regarded</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Before the 1994 elections the IFP used</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taxpayers' money to train and arm a military force, writes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stefaans BrUmmer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANGOSUTHU BUTHELEZI and his Inkatha Freedom Party lieutenants</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operatives - hatched an elaborate plan before the 1994 elections</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to ensure the Zulu nationalist party had a military force able to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resist the incorporation of KwaZulu into an African National</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress- ruled South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviews with three agents directly involved in the operation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">show the KwaZulu government, of which Buthelezi was chief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">minister, used millions of rands of taxpayers' money between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 1993 and the eve of the elections in April 1994 to train</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- arguably illegally - a reserve of up to 8 000 paramilitary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed the Inkatha army was the subject of an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigation by the Investigative Task Unit which was recently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disbanded. The Transvaal attorney general is investigating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possible criminal charges in connection with the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of protestations from key IFP officials that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project had been privately funded, the KwaZulu-Natal auditor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">general pronounced last year that there had been about R6,7-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million &quot;unauthorised state expenditure&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are fears the warrior network is still partially intact</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">movement opts for a militaristic way of dealing with the ANC-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controlled central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final weeks before the elections, well over 1 000 of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trainees were temporarily incorporated into the now- disbanded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu Police (KZP), where they were allegedly to have formed the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">core of an unofficial army loyal to the self- governing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">territory's IFP rulers - despite objections from KZP commissioner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roy During that the appointment of the paramilitary fighters was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">irregular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The training coincided with the IFP's continued absence from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the multi-party negotiations at Kempton Park and refusal to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participate in the elections, a stand it reversed only a week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before voting started. During this time KwaZulu and Natal were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">engulfed in the worst political violence in recent history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence monitors say there were more deaths in KwaZulu-Natal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the time of the training. There were allegations that IFPSelf-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protection Unit (SPU)graduates were responsible for much of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mayhem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project blurred distinctions between the IFP's party-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political agenda, the then- KwaZulu government and the now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disbanded KZP. The top command of the old South African Police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(SAP), including then- commissioner Johan van der Merwe and his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deputy, Basie Smit, allegedly knew of and abetted the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has established that in mid-1993 an initial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attempt was made under IFP central committee member Walter Felgate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to revive the relatively uncoordinated and small-scale training of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP recruits that had been a feature of the regional conflict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">since the former South African Defence Force (SADF) extricated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">itself, in the early 1990s, from its covert training and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operational support of IFP warriors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affidavits from men who took part in the new training - and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">evidence from the trial of former Vlakplaas commander Eugene De</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kock - suggest these were follow-ups, although without clear SADF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">backing, to Operation Marion, the covert programme launched in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mid-1980s by the SADF Department of Military Intelligence to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">create an anti-ANC paramilitary bulwark for the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rightwing extremist former special forces soldier Willem Ratte</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was employed, under one Riaan van Rensburg, to do the actual</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">training at a farm in the old KaNgwane homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Felgate initiative fizzled out in December 1993 -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disowned by Buthelezi. Meanwhile, IFP legislator and former SAP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">security branch agent Philip Powell had become involved in a much</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more ambitious programme to train IFP SPUs in September or October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1993. Powell, who has also been connected by De Kock to the SADF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">front company Longreach, has been tipped to become MEC for safety</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and security in KwaZulu-Natal. Until April 1994 between 5 000 and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8 000 men and women were trained at Mlaba Camp near Ulundi (and to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a lesser extent at the nearby Emandleni-Matleng Camp).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the IFP and KwaZulu government claimed they would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deployed as defensive SPU members allowed under the National Peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accord, witness statements suggest instruction included offensive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tactics - including sabotage and ambushing. After the training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">courses, which lasted about six weeks, the recruits were sent to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their communities with instructions to train others and form SPUs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instructors included Powell as Mlaba camp commander, deputy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commander Thompson Xesibe and one M Twala - all three IFP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials. Xesibe had been prominent among the IFP recruits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trained during Operation Marion by the SADF in the Caprivi. As</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many as two dozen more Caprivi graduates, most or all of them by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">then KZP members, assisted in the training, suggesting a blurring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of responsibility between the KZP, the IFP and the KwaZulu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter De Kock and his crowd from the then- disbanded SAP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vlakplaas hitsquad: De Kock testified in his trial last year that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Powell's request he had obtained six truckloads of weaponry -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including explosives, ammunition, mortars and grenades - from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">state arms company Mechem in October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of this weaponry remains untraced, leading to fears that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some IFP trainees may still have access to it. A number of witness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statements say former Vlakplaas officer Nicolaas Vermeulen and a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">number of Vlakplaas askaris went to Mlaba, where they also helped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the training. Other evidence suggests a few rightwingers,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including Ratte, did the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final weeks before the elections, Buthelezi's cabinet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ordered that at least 1 000 of the trainees be incorporated into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the KZP as special constables. The incorporation was conceived by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell as a basis for an unofficial army, loyal to the KwaZulu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incorporation of the recruits into the KZN might have been a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ploy to bypass legal restrictions which prevented KwaZulu, like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other self-governing territories, from setting up its own army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell also feared the creation of a formal army could trigger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">armed intervention from the South African government. The KwaZulu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cabinet, worried that KwaZulu could meet a similar fate to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bophuthatswana, appears to have accepted Powell's plan lock, stock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and barrel on March 15 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, the IFP was still holding out against joining South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's first democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, the plan was in full swing. Application was made to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the KwaZulu Public Service Commission for the creation of 2 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">special constable posts. Press reports at the time show that KZP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Commissioner Sipho Mathe finalised a deal to collect 1 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LM4 rifles from the parastatal Eskom at a cost of R2,1-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arms deal collapsed two days later when an Eskom executive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chanced on Powell and others loading the weapons at an Eskom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">facility onto KZP lorries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Goldstone Commission subsequently found Eskom had not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officially sanctioned the deal - and that SAP commissioner General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johan van der Merwe had personally authorised a permit to make the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;export&quot; of the weapons to KwaZulu possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early April, Buthelezi instructed During to speed up the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">incorporation process - allegedly ordering him to accept all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">identified trainees into the KZP immediately, and that details</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">such as screening and further training could be done later. During</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is understood to have ignored the instruction, insisting that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">poorly trained recruits in the KZP could have serious implications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for his force .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, 1 200 or more trainees were reassembled at Mlaba</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to begin additional training as &quot;special constables&quot;. During</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">applied for R14-million in additional funds from the KwaZulu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">treasury in the week before the elections, saying 1 500 extra</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policemen had been employed under cabinet instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFP plan came to an abrupt end on April 25 and 26, as the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">vote was about to start, when the &quot;special constables&quot; were paid</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - We saw last week how Mussolini used the Wal Wal incident of December 1934 to launch his unprovoked invasion of Ethiopia, on 3 October 1935.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now read on: Confronted with the long-anticipated act of invasion the League of Nations met, on 5 October, and, six days later, ruled that the Italian Government was guilty of having resorted to war in disregard of the League Covenant. This decision was reached by fifty votes to one (Italy), with three abstentions: Albania, Austria and Hungary. All three were either dependent on Italy or ideologically allied to her fascist government. On the same day the League established a committee to consider the imposition of sanctions against the aggressor. The committee duly proposed four prohibitions, which became effective on 18 November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These comprised:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An embargo on the exportation, re-exportation, or transit of arms, ammunition, and implements of war to Italy and the Italian colonies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An embargo on loans and credits to the Italian Government or to public authorities, persons or corporations in Italian territory, either directly or indirectly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An embargo on the importation of goods grown, produced, or manufactured in Italy or Italian possessions, or consigned therefrom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. An embargo on the exportation or re-exportation to Italy or Italian possessions of transport animals, rubber, bauxite, aluminium, iron ore, scrap iron, chromium, manganese, nickel, titanium, tungsten, anadium, their ores and ferro-alloys, tin and tin-ore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These prohibitions, which were described by the British economist, Lord Keynes, as &quot;comparatively mild&quot; economic sanctions, contained several major omissions, which, as many commentators have observed, rendered the whole scheme nugatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prohibition 1, on arms, thus &quot;hardly restricted Italy which could manufacture its own armaments&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prohibitions 2 and 3, on loans to Italy and imports therefrom, could be only of long-term significance, and &quot;would have been effective only if the war was prolonged until Italian gold reserves were exhausted&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prohibition 4, on exports to Italy, proved, however, the greatest disappointment to the sanctionist cause, for it excluded several strategic commodities on the grounds that Italy could obtain them from countries outside the League, notably the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crucially important commodities excluded from the embargo included steel, pig iron, copper, cotton and above all oil. The absurdity of these exclusions was later noted by Winston Churchill, who commented: &quot;The export of aluminium into Italy was strictly forbidden; but aluminium was almost the only metal that Italy produced in quantities beyond her own needs. The importation of scrap iron and iron ore into Italy was sternly vetoed in the name of public justice. But the Italian metallurgical industry made but little use of them, and as steel billets and pig iron were not interfered with, Italy suffered no hindrance&quot;. The League's sanctions, Churchill concluded, were therefore &quot;not real sanctions to paralyse the aggressor, but merely such half-hearted sanctions as the aggressor would tolerate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disillusion with the League's action was also captured by the British cartoonist David Low. He depicted Sir Samuel Hoare and Anthony Eden, the British Minister for League Affairs, asking Laval whether it was not time to lock the stable door. The French leader archly replies, &quot;But no, the horse, he is not yet flown&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanctions, though unable to halt the aggression, were not without considerable effect on the Italian economy. The Banca d'Italia's gold reserves, which had stood on 31 December 1934, a few days after the Wal Wal incident, at 5.8 billion lire, soon began to drop. In an attempt to save the situation the Italian Government took over all private gold deposits, but the bank's reserves by 20 October 1935, a fortnight after the beginning of hostilities, had fallen to 3.9 billion. A decree was thereupon issued to prohibit the continued publication of information on gold holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Queen of Italy soon afterwards led a campaign, initiated on 18 December, for her women compatriots to surrender their gold wedding rings to the State.  Despite this much publicised event, the bank's reserves, we now know, fell by August 1936 to only 2.2 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under these circumstances the value of the lira, which Mussolini had long sought to defend, had to be devalued, on 5 October 1936, by no less than 59 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main Italian invasion, launched from the colony of Eritrea, was at first directed by De Bono. He initially encountered no resistance. The Emperor had ordered his troops to pull back from the frontier area, to squash any pretence that Ethiopia was the aggressor, as well as perhaps to extend the enemy's lines of communication. Ethiopian resistance was moreover weakened at the beginning of the campaign by the defection of the Emperor's disaffected ex-son-in-law, Dajazmach Hayla Sellase Gugsa, governor of eastern Tegray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From the opening of the campaign De Bono was under strong pressure from Mussolini to achieve a speedy victory, so as to capture Addis Ababa before the rainy season, expected to begin toward the end of June 1936. This was essential, as the Duce saw it, both to boost Italian morale, which would otherwise soon have flagged, and to forestall any possible extension of sanctions. De Bono on the other hand feared that too rapid an advance would dangerously extend his lines of communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He revealed this in the secrecy of his diary, where he observes that &quot;the cat that was in a hurry made blind kittens&quot;. As a result of his cautious policy, and stiff Ethiopian resistance, the Italian advance ground almost to a halt. De Bono had seized Aksum, forty miles within Ethiopia, on 15 October 1935, but it took him over three weeks, until 8 November, to capture Maqal, little more than 60 kilometres further south. The Duce, frustrated by this painfully slow progress, three days later commanded him to advance &quot;without hesitation&quot;. The harassed commander replied that greater speed was virtually impossible, and that &quot;the military situation should have precedence over any other consideration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mussolini, infuriated by this response, dismissed De Bono, on 14 November, and replaced him by an Italian career general, Pietro Badoglio, whom he authorised, on 28 December, &quot;to use, even on a vast scale, any kind of gas and flamethrowers&quot;. Aware that these instructions flouted the Geneva Convention of 1926 banning the use of gas, the dictator cynically countermanded his instructions, on 5 January 1936. &quot;Suspend the use of gas&quot;, he telegraphed, &quot;until the Geneva meetings unless it becomes necessary for supreme offensive or defensive necessity. I will give you further instructions with regard to this&quot;. The said instructions came a fortnight later when Mussolini once more telegraphed, &quot;I authorise Your Excellency to use all means of war - I say all, both from the air and from the ground&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Emperor meanwhile was endeavouring to organise Ethiopian resistance in the face of overwhelming odds. On 11 November, he flew to Jigiga, in Ogaden, and drove thence to Daggabur, to strengthen resistance on the south-eastern frontier, facing Italian Somalia. Then, at the end of the month, he proceeded to Das, in Wallo, which, despite heavy enemy bombing, was to be his headquarters for the remainder of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mussolini throughout this time was &quot;extremely nervous&quot;, as his representative to the League, Count Aloisi, later admitted, that sanctions might be extended to include oil. The dictator went so far as to warn Laval, at the end of November, that Italy would regard this as &quot;an unfriendly act&quot;, and later admitted to Hitler that if an oil sanction had been imposed he would have had to &quot;withdraw from Abyssinia within a week&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The scene was set on Sunday 2, Adwa Day, for an afternoon of reggae fun in the sun. The heat was not much fun however, even for the sun- worshippers in the crowd. Pushing and shoving your way to the only source of refreshment, a soft drink truck on one side of the square, then paying five birr for a near-boiling drink, was also an unnecessary inconvenience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, and did I mention that Bob Marley's family didn't show up?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't get me wrong, I don't want to put a bad vibe over the day 'mon'. I'm a great lover of reggae, and will always go to watch and support. What is hard to work out is why there wasn't any pre-warning about the absence of the main act. The road crew were obviously from outside Ethiopia. Did they make the flight but the band didn't? Was the sound problem which lasted over an hour because there was no earlier sound check?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the problems were resolved, a drumming group started the day. The Express Band, Chachi and Judah all contributed and people started dancing.  Then the overseas artists began bringing sounds from Jamaica, America and the UK. The sun relaxed and it had the same affect on the people. Pretty soon everyone was up and dancing, lighting fires which although dangerous, was good to watch. It's safe to say that by the end of the evening the crowd were feeling suitably 'irie'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outdoor events of this type are still in the beginning stages here. A concert featuring a style of music and culture that uses the Ethiopian colours and holds an Ethiopian emperor in such high esteem, is certainly important. Let's hope we can see more live, and organized, music in Meskel Square very soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Day After</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having had to miss the Sunday concert , I was feeling very disappointed to say the least -- until I listened to what those who had gone had to say.  Thousands attended that day having willingly paid their ten birr. Logic says there must have been at least some in the audience who went home happy and satisfied, but all those I met were miserable, burnt beyond recognition by the long hours in the sun--and with a suddenly well developed sarcasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when I went to the Imperial Hotel for a press conference, given by the Reggae Unites Africa 1997 promoter Bob Morgan and other members of the company Rastar, it was with the total belief that here would be 18 highly embarrassed Rastafarains. On the contrary, to the amazement of the reporters, the group was relaxing in the lobby obviously in high moods, even breaking out into the odd song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the press conference did finally start--nearly two hours late--Bob Morgan, J. Delgado and Inqulah Rastafarian told the press that they did not know why Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, comprising of Rita, Damian and Julian Marley, did not make it to the concert. We are not going to apologize for Ziggy Marley's absence the group said, noting that they had fulfilled their part of the bargain and put on a good performance. We were just like the public, until the last minute we were hoping they would show up the group said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently the two groups were supposed to connect in London, but when the Marleys failed to show up the others left assuming the rest would catch up in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copies of a fax sent by the Marley's manager, Addis Gessesse stating that Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers would come to Ethiopia to perform were circulated to the press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The &quot;Ferenjis&quot; call them the &quot;little rains&quot;. We call them the &quot;Belg&quot; rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;little rains&quot; are so called, because they are much less in quantity than the &quot;big rains&quot; (or the &quot;Kremt&quot;) which fall during June, July, August and part of September. The &quot;little rains&quot; typically come during the February- April period. And now it is the first week of March, but the &quot;Little rains&quot; have not yet put in an appearance, at least in Addis Ababa, which receives a great deal of both the &quot;Kremt&quot; and &quot;Belg&quot; rains.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is still time for them to arrive as the &quot;Belg&quot; season generally extends to May and officially begins in March. But the omens in the skies of Addis are not particular encouraging at the moment. They are clear and blue and, but for some tempering winds, the heat in the afternoon is quite intense.  The dreaded word &quot;drought&quot; is already on the lips of many people. Is 1997/98 going to be another drought year, after two consecutive, good crop years? It is still too early to say, but there have been foreign reports, including those of the BBC, that countries in East Africa may experience drought conditions in the 1997/98 period. With respect to Ethiopia, the BBC mentioned particularly the Ogaden region. Ethiopian officials appear to have recognized the possibility of drought at least in some regions of the country as may be gathered from the following passage which appeared in the &quot;Ethiopian Herald&quot; ( the government-owned English daily newspaper) of February 22, 1997:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;a study aimed at identifying the magnitude of the drought-caused disaster in Afder and Liben Zones of Somali Regional State is being conducted. An assessment team drawn from the regional disaster prevention and preparedness and health bureaus as well as the regional council was deployed to the zones to get first-hand information on the state of the drought disaster to determine the quality of relief food to be dispatched to the areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A failure of the &quot;Belg&quot; rains is usually regarded as a harbinger of a similar failure of the &quot;Kremt&quot; rains, although this need not always be the case. A failure of the &quot;Kremt&quot; represents total disaster, as it accounts for about 90 percent of total crop production. The &quot;Belg&quot; rains account for the remainder on average, but they are much more important in some regions, particularly in Bale, Tigray and Wello. If the &quot;little rains&quot;fail to materialize, the country's total crop production may drop by as much as 10 percent; if the &quot;Kremt&quot; fails or the rains prove inadequate, then we will have to contend with yet another drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, should drought strike again, mass starvation as in past years is unlikely, given the officially reported grain, mainly maize, surplus of 5-10 million quintals for the current 1996/97 year. It may nevertheless be necessary to halt the present drive to export maize to neighboring and other countries, which, it appears, have been prompted to import Ethiopian maize by prospects of drought conditions in their own climatic zones. On the other hand, the present policy of persuading donor countries and international organizations to buy surplus maize on the domestic market for distribution to food-insecure people in food-deficit and other regions of the country is commendable and should thus be continued on a more systematic basis. But, of course, there may not be a drought after all, and the current signs of drought conditions may be short-lived. At any rate, concerning the &quot;Belg&quot; rains nothing certain is likely to emerge before the end of March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the event of a drought, the assistance to be obtained from international and domestic NGO's becomes particularly important. But the relations between the government and many of these NGO's appear to have soured quite a bit in recent months, leading to outright closure of a sizeable number of them.  Apparently, this problem does not seem to have been solved in any satisfactory manner as may be appreciated from the following excerpts from the &quot;Ethiopian Herald&quot; of the same date as quoted above:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, a statement issued by the commission (i.e. Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission -DPPC) indicated that late submission and incompleteness of plan of operation by NGO's continues to be a problem. Out of 240 NGO's expected to submit their annual plans of operation in 1996, 34 have not submitted, it said, and indicated that 96 others have not yet handed in their 1997 plans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nazareth Children Center and Integrated Development Organization was banned from operating in Tigray Eastern Zone for failure to meet provisions in the agreement it signed, zonal disaster prevention and preparedness department said. The department said the welfare organization's performance through 1985 E.C. in its area of operation in Ganta Afeshumu Woreda of the zone has been proved to be insignificant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why it is difficult for some NGO's to submit plans of operation to the DPPC and why the government has taken such harsh measures against such NGO's remain a mystery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if 1997/98 turns out to be a drought year, there are quite a few things going for Ethiopia at present including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a still comfortable level of foreign reserves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* rising world prices for its major export commodity, coffee;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a considerable amount of foreign soft loans and grants in the pipeline;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the reported nine-fold increases in the country's food security reserves;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the reported 5-10 million quintals of surplus grain in the 1996/97 harvest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, in the spirit of &quot;disaster prevention and preparedness&quot; it would be advisable to take the following measures in the face of what appear to be dangerous weather warning signals:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* prepare as soon as possible a comprehensive weather conditions and crop production prospects report covering the whole country, with particular reference to regions likely to be affected by the current weather changes; ( this is to be just a general survey not an in - depth assessment);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* estimate the needs for relief aid in the event of a drought;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* submit estimated relief requirements to donor countries and international organizations in good time;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* prepare preliminary appropriations for the government budget and a action plan to implement it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* patch up differences between the PPDC and NGO's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope we will not need all these reports and relief needs estimated, but it would be wise to err on the side of safely and security. The &quot;little rains&quot; may be only a little late now; however, there is no telling whether they will arrive at all this &quot;Belg&quot; season!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Zambia has expelled about 300 Mozambicans who sought refuge in that country because of February's devastating floods in the Zambezi River basin, a Mozambican newspaper reported Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper, Noticias, said the victims were now sheltering in the small town of Malowera, in Mozambique's Tete province, just south of the Zambian border.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's ambassador in Maputo, Bellon Chisuta, told the newspaper that he knew nothing about the expulsions and cast doubt on the veracity of the reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a Mozambican government delegation is due to visit Zambia shortly to find out why Lusaka took this measure. The two countries have had a long history of friendship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of Mozambique's Refugee Support Nucleus, Fernando Fazenda, said the expulsions violated a protocol on refugees signed between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Fazenda said that Malawian authorities, though not resorting to forced repatriation, have said they are unwilling to receive a joint mission from the Mozambique Support Nucleus and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to discuss the situation of up to 60,000 Mozambicans who have fled into Nsanje district in southern Malawi, because of the floods. &quot;We wanted to go to Malawi to see at first hand the conditions of our fellow countrymen,&quot; Fazenda said. &quot;Together with the Malawian authorities and the UNHCR, we wanted to find ways of helping them. But Malawi is not willing to receive us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German Embassy in Lusaka said this action followed an appeal for aid, to the international community, by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contribution, to be transferred to commissioner's headquarters in Geneva, is to be reserved for refugee support programmes to be implemented in Zambia between March 1 and July 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;German hopes that its contribution will help to alleviate the plight of the refugees and will make it easier for Zambia to continue its traditional hospitality in this field,&quot; the embassy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's home affairs minister, Chitalu Sampa, appealed to donors Tuesday for help in dealing with the influx of Zairian refugees. The refugees have been fleeing a westward rebel advance in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sampa said that there was great human suffering at northern Mpulungu Port, the main refugee entry point into Zambia. He said that due to congestion and exhaustion there have been 29 official deaths recorded among the 2,000 Zairian refugees who have entered Zambia since October 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GABORONE, Botswana (PANA) - African Commonwealth leaders concluded a key democracy and good governance round-table late February, against the backdrop of a number of destabilizing factors undermining political reforms on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders, who met in the remote game resort of Kasane on the Botswana border with Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, decried the prevalence of poverty, tribalism and &quot;brain drain&quot; as factors that threaten the continent's young democracies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While recognizing the importance of political opposition, they expressed reservations about the activities of some unnamed foreign funded non- governmental organizations which promoted activities &quot;detrimental to stable democratic processes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roundtable, described by Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku as unique and ground-breaking, began on Feb. 24 with meetings of ministers and opposition leaders from Africa's 18 Commonwealth states.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents who attended the retreat were Ketumile Masire of Botswana, Yahya Jammeh of Gambia, Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya, Bakili Muluzi of Malawi, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Frederick Chiluba of Zambia and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other countries represented by prime ministers or deputies were Cameroon, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia, Seychelles, Swaziland and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Nigeria, suspended from the commonwealth in 1995 for its human rights record, was not invited to the meeting which sought to assess progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commonwealth's Harare Declaration of 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of ruling and opposition parties who met prior to the leaders' retreat had earlier made various proposals, among them, the need for the Commonwealth to initiate a common code of conduct which would be binding on all African political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed code of conduct, which was not included in a joint statement produced at the end of the leaders' retreat, would have enshrined the right of the victorious party in an election to rule as well as the right of losing parties to oppose the rules by constitutional means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would also call for equal access to the media as well as state funding for political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the joint statement, the leaders underlined that sustainable democracy could only grow within society and could be neither prescribed nor imposed from outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democracy is not foreign to Africa,&quot; Nigerian-born Chief Anyaoku said. &quot; Where I come from there is a saying that a chief is a chief by the will of the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders noted that even countries like Swaziland and Nigeria, which banned political activity, were currently working on a timetable for reforms which could see them introduce political pluralism in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, despite the commitment expressed by the leaders, Africa still faces a formidable enemy in the form of inter-ethnic conflicts in many parts of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These conflicts, Moi said, were the major impediments to efforts by Commonwealth Africa to embrace democratic tenets as outlined in the Harare declaration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said peace and stability, key ingredients in the democratization process, would never be guaranteed in Commonwealth Africa unless ethnic strife in the region was contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the Great Lakes region, Moi said a lasting solution should be found to problems afflicting Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire if political reforms in other countries in the region were to be cemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My country, for example, may be peaceful and stable, but we cannot live in peace with the turmoil we see all around us in Somalia, the Sudan and in the Great Lakes region,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya is leading regional efforts to bring lasting solution to the crisis in eastern Zaire where anti-government forces have captured large areas in their attempt to topple the regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is regrettable that at a time when Africa should be addressing the economic challenges facing her, the scarce resources are being devoted to quelling civil strife and ethnic conflicts,&quot; Moi pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains to be seen whether the February round-table could have laid a strong enough foundation that could see Commonwealth Africa becoming a shining example to the rest of the continent or whether it was just another high-level summit that comes to nought as was the fate of similar initiatives in the past.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization said also it would send a senior military officer, Col.  Gustav Zoula, from its Addis Ababa headquarters to Bangui, capital of the Central African republic, from March 16.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer will, during his two-weeks stay in the country, help the international follow-up committee on the Bangui Accords to implement disarmament of rebel soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreements provide for an end to the mutiny, disarmament, formation of a government of national unity, and the reintegration of rebels into the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both moves are follow ups to an O.A.U. peace mission to Libreville, capital of Gabon, and Bangui, in February. That mission was headed by the organization's assistant secretary-general, Pascal Gayama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria and Sierra Leone signed in Lagos Friday an accord renewing their military cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence chief, Maj.Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, initialled the agreement for Nigeria, while Sierra Leonean deputy minister of defence, Rtd. Capt. Sam Norman, signed for his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pact, known as &quot;Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), provides for the expansion of the Nigerian Army Training Agreement (NATAG) signed between both countries in 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While NATAG provided for the training of Sierra Leonean troops only, SOFA covers training for the navy, air force, the police and other security agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abubakar said the agreement was a reaffirmation of Nigeria's support for Sierra leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said both countries had socio-economic and cultural ties over the years, having trained together as part of the Royal West African Frontier Force and more recently, collaborating under the West African peace monitoring force or Ecomog, in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contemporary developments have proved that no nation could stand alone, Abubakar said, noting that the emphasis in international relations was collective regional security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He announced that Brig.Gen. Jimi Ojokojo would head the Nigerian training mission to Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his response, Norman said with the agreement, both countries had made an undertaking to protect their peoples. He said Sierra Leone always looked up to Nigeria as a bigger brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The renewal of the military pact came amid reports by a Lagos newspaper that Sierra Leonean rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, arrived in Lagos early this week at the invitation of an unnamed businessman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Concord newspaper reported Friday that Sankoh was arrested Sunday by the Nigerian police for being in possession of arms at the Lagos airport. The daily said he was later handed over to the presidential guards who flew him to Abuja, for further questioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neither the Nigerian authorities nor the Sierra Leonean High Commission in Lagos could confirm or deny the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sankoh is leader of Sierra Leone's Revolutionary Unity Front (RUF), which has been waging a bush war against the Freetown government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warring parties recently signed a peace accord brokered by Cote d'Ivoire to end the six-year-old civil strife, which has killed at least 15, 000 people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The immense opportunities offered by Africa for American businesses will again feature at a major trade and investment conference to be hosted in May by the City of Scottsdale in the state of Arizona, the south-western United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizers, Phoenix-based AMI Consultants, told PANA that the May 1-2 forum would discuss emerging opportunities for U.S. investment in Africa. It will also deal with the challenges, information, facilitation and support programmes among a host of issues on how to do business in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Few regions of the world offer more untapped opportunity for U.S.  businesses than Africa,&quot; said Robert Sherman, President of AMI Consultants, in pre-conference papers released to PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet, the companies that have entered that market constitute only 'the tip of the iceberg' compared to the enormous opportunities that exist in this large and resource-endowed continent,&quot; Sherman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sub-Sahara Africa is a market of nearly 750 million persons. The annual rate of returns on the U.S. foreign direct investment has been calculated by the Department of Commerce at 28 percent. This is higher than any other part of the World, the document noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, Sherman said the conference would highlight specific opportunities and identify resources that are available to assist U.S.  businesses participating in the commercial development of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also present the range and depth of assistance available from a host of U.S. and multilateral funding institutions which, between them, manage some 40 billion U.S. dollars for African projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Additional sessions will highlight private sector experiences focusing on practical realities that underscores success in trading and investment in Africa,&quot; Sherman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African ambassadors and commercial attaches accredited to the U.S., he said, had been invited to provide country specific reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dignitaries invited to speak at the forum, billed to take place at the Sunburst Resort in Scotsdale, Arizona, include U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Arizona governor Fife Symington, Senators John McCain and John Kyl as well as many local officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose, David Miller of the Corporate Council on Africa, the Reverend Leon Sullivan of IFESH, among other ranking officials from the State and Commerce departments which are co-hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMI Consultants, which in 1996 organized a similar forum tagged &quot;Africa96&quot; in Phoenix, says participation fees range from 95 to 150 dollars payable as from April 10, 1997.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Komatipoort - The misunderstood bat may prove to be an effective means of combatting malaria-carrying mosquitos, says Dr Gary Bronner, a project leader for the Angolan free-tailed bat study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bronner, a senior lecturer at the Department of Zoology at Potchefstroom University, said the aim of the study was to determine if the Angolan free- tailed bat and lesser free-tailed bat could effectively control mosquito numbers in specifically the Komatipoort area in Mpumalanga.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to find out if the bats eat everything they come across or if they are fussy,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to determine how much of the bat's diet is made up of mosquitos, and if we find bats are actually valuable malaria fighters, perhaps they'll lose their bad image,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transvaal Sugar Limited (TSB), the largest sugar manufacturer in the area, has proposed sponsoring a Zoology student R10 000 to help</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conduct the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The project is looking at a long term approach and not a quick-fix solution to the problem of malaria in this area,&quot; explains TSB spokesperson, Riaan Pienaar, on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bronner and his team are searching for a student prepared to live for a certain length of time in Komatipoort, a small farming community along the border of Mozambique, to study the two bat types.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bats would have to be caught and ringed, and injected with sterilised water for later blood testing to determine the amount of energy the bat consumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The student would also have to determine how many mosquitos were eaten by the bat. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MALELANE - When the rural villagers of the far eastern Mpumalanga heard that their area had been targeted for multi-million rand development, they rejoiced at the pending economic libera-tion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Little did they realise that the onslaught of hundreds of cash-flush labourers working on dam and other infrastructure sites, would leave their agriculturally based communities reeling under a 50 to 100 percent increase in HIV infections as well as a litany of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason: single men working on construction sites for months on end and with nothing to really spend their wages on, easily seduced rural women and even young school girls with promises of money, clothing or even food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga AIDs and STD Programme head, Dr Calvin Billinghurst explains that 19 percent of women living in the rural triangle between Komatipoort, Barberton and the northern border of Swaziland, admit that they are aware their construction worker husbands and lovers regularly practice unsafe sex with other women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This brings into question, says Dr Billing-hurst, just how much responsibility the construction industry management should shoulder in the sexual health education of their workers, and how much must be left to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the Mpumalanga Department of Health's major clinics in the area have shown increases of up to 100 percent in HIV and STDs since construction began on the R488 million Driekoppies Dam along the Lomati River in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the construction of the dam, there's been a definite increase in the number of STDs. It will be interesting to see if levels drop after the dam is completed,&quot; adds Dr Billinghurst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social workers also say that the rapid shift of employment from low paying agricultural jobs to a weekly cash wage system in the construction trade, without any increase in spending outlets has disrupted the traditional social fabric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teenage delinquency, teenage pregnancy, increased drinking problems and an alleged decline in respect for traditional authority structures have all accompanied the develop-ment projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driekoppies's site manager, Mike Nietsche, admitted to Reconstruct that his workers were not being educated with regards to safe sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least 75 percent of the workers live in surrounding villages and we agreed with the Department of Health one year ago that their clinics would be responsible for the necessary education,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their people are trained and paid to do that,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction on the dam is expected to continue until at least the beginning of 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another large industry operating in the area, Transvaal Sugar Limited (TSB) spent two years on the construction of its second regional sugar mill, costing R418 million, north of a tribal village called Naas, but has been praised by health workers for its commitment to primary health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TSB's very good. They have their own clinics and regularly make use of organisations like the AIDs Training Information and Counselling Centre (Aticc) which has a large budget for the free distribution of condoms,&quot; says Dr Billinghurst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TSB nursing sister, Zelda Van Jaarsveld, explains that the company has ten clinics and annually organises a large theatre production about the dangers of unsafe sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also conduct formal training sessions, as well as informal training sessions where we go into the workplace and discuss the use of condoms with workers,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Billinghurst warns that Mpumalanga has the second highest HIV/AIDs rate in the country with 16 percent of the province's population being infected with HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, a sample survey of 1 000 women indicate that five percent of babies are being born HIV positive, which means the province could face a negative growth rate within two to three years,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, Mpumalanga has a population growth rate of 4,5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think only when people feel the enormous impact of full-blown AIDs which should start affecting the population in two to three years time, will it be taken more seriously,&quot; Dr Billinghurst warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the staggering implications full-blown AIDs will have on the province's economy, industrial and corporate management should perhaps consider shouldering greater responsibility in creating awareness about the killer disease. .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NELSPUIT - South Africa's sporting hero, Josaya Thugwane is trapped in an almost impenetrable cocoon of cliches created by the country's media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's the nation's &quot;golden boy&quot;, the &quot;rags to riches&quot; story of everybody's dreams who &quot;overcame all odds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first black South African to win an Olympic gold medal, Josaya was photographed as a gargantuan in cool shades crossing the finish line in Atlanta with ease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality, the 45 kilogram megastar is a pintsized 1,55 metre cleaner who is swallowed up by executive chairs like a toddler on dad's lazy-boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's serious, gives only occasional smiles, and genuinely believes that he hasn't won the medal, but that the faceless 40-million of a fledgling Rainbow Nation have won it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fawning of politicians, premiers and mayors who threw him the &quot;mother of all parties&quot; and spun him on a two-week blitz of Mpumalanga, only exhausted the quiet family man, often leaving him in a blinking daze, but he suffered it all with unselfish patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I've done, I haven't done for political organisations,&quot; he says simply. &quot;In South Africa there are a lot of organisations and the people who run those organisations are South African and I won this medal for South Africa. I have done this for South Africa,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josaya says he wants as many South Africans as possible to see &quot;their&quot; medal and that the only way that could be done, was for him to go to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the services of a Zulu translator, it's quite a task to fathom the man. He does not show much emotion, talking in low monotones with only the occasional lift of eyebrows and widening of eyes to stress a point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frustrated photographers attempting to capture him on film when he was granted the freedom of Mpumalanga and Nelspruit, referred to him as &quot;dead-pan&quot; and &quot;like a statue'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just not good, just not good,&quot; some muttered in a low-key frenzy, nervously glancing at their watches as their deadlines drew nearer and the pintsized hero remained annoylingly expressionless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the mention of music, the sombre face breaks out into an impish grin and we learn that the wee African has a thang for reggae! If, he says, reggae was played at Premier Mathews Phosa's big bash for him, all exhaustion would melt away. Josaya's into boogieing, you see, despite being a teetotaller (not because of any Christian values - he only attends church when he feels like it) but because it wouldn't do his training any good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, yes, I dance!&quot; he says brightly. &quot;I'll only drink coke and stuff, but I'll dance, especially if its reggae,&quot; he insists, listing Lucky Dube and the Toots and the Maytals as his favourite reggae bands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True to ardent reggae fans, Josaya sported funky dreadlocks when he went over to Atlanta, but because of the humidity, he was forced to cut them off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when his mother's employer called her to see him cross the finish line, she didn't recognise him without his dreads and refused to believe it was him,&quot; explains Josaya's chaperone during the provincial blitz, Musa Mlombo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the bit of rebel in him (and, of course, the extraordinary rise to international fame), Josaya insists he is quite ordinary and describes his daily routine as running, bathing, watching the news, and having early nights.  Josaya's other interests still involve running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's a sports game in the township, I go watch it, especially if it's soccer,&quot; says the runner, whose interest in running started when he played township soccer himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also attends school sports days in Emzinoni township near Bethal, and helps out with the 1 500m races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But even if they don't need my help, I run with the kids for fun,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josaya has always been popular in the township, and this has been attributed to his general kindness. For instance, he can't say exactly how many pairs of running shoes he owns because, he explains, besides the 20 pairs at home, there are many that he's given away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even though the diminutive star lately has to drive through the dusty township rather than walk so as to avoid happy crowds who want to shake his hand, he does not consider himself a hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not like a movie star, and if I am a hero, it's too early to tell,&quot; he says, reverting to his usual modesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether the road show had disturbed his family life, Josaya says he's spent every possible moment with his wife, Zodwa and two of his four children, who have accompanied him since he landed to the glare of camera flashes and TV lights at Johannesburg International Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is the violent crime in South Africa that really motivates Josaya to keep his family at his side. After a vicious attempt on his life during a hijacking in March, he's been looking for a safer place to keep Zodwa and the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was shot in the face and they took my car. I did not know if I would be able to run in the Olympics. Even when I was well, I was afraid to go because there was no-one to look after my family. I tried to move them to Hendrina, where it is safer, but was unable to,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really am afraid of the violence and that is one of the reasons I want a house and not a shack - houses are safer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The importance of his own family makes sense when he describes his childhood, a tale which would make any Hollywood director weep for not thinking up the story-line himself. It is likely to forever cast Josaya as a new folk hero for a new era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was raised differently to other people who had a mother and father,&quot; he starts. Josaya was born to a teenage mother on a farm in Mpumalanga on April 15, 1971, and was adopted by his grandparents. He's never known his father and his somewhat estranged mother lives with a boyfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His only taste of education lasted a few months when an uncle took him to a farm school at the age of 13. He was to start Sub A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But my uncle died and I had to get a job because we had no food and I had to look after my grandmother,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josaya's first job was that of an unpaid cattle herder, while he and his grandmother lived with an uncle and aunt who were farm labourers on a farm outside Bethal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody was allowed to stay on the farm without working. I earned nothing, and my uncle earned a bag of mealie meal every month which would have to feed the four of us,&quot; he says, using that slight lift of the eyebrows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the age of 14, Josaya left home to find work in Kriel, where he worked as a garden boy in the gardens of suburbanites for the nexst three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the age of 17 when, he says, &quot;the spirit of running entered me&quot;, Josaya joined Koornfontein mine, as a cleaner of the staff quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing his experiences at the mine, it soon becomes clear - Josaya is a no-nonsense man. In fact, he is often accused by management of being cheeky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When told by mine management to work on weekends, he dug in his heels - he couldn't afford to cut into his training time. His stubborness paid off and he was finally accommodated by being transferred to work in the kitchens as a dishwasher and server.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, after insisting on three months leave to go to circumcision school, Josaya returned to work to find someone else had taken over his kitchen duties, and was told he was to work underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I refused. They said it would only be for six to twelve months, but the dust is bad for my lungs and after working so long underground during the day, I wouldn't have the strength to train at night,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, mine managment refused to negotiate, and Josaya refused to budge.  He resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He began training under the guidance of American-based athletics agent, Tony Longhurst, and won the 1993 South African marathon title. Thereafter, he was trained by one of South Africa's formeost long distance coaches, Bobby McGee, who nurtured Josaya to his penultimate victory at Atlanta in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Josaya is actually uncoachable,&quot; says McGee. &quot;He is very much a 'feel' runner who takes what works for him and basically designs his own training programme,&quot; says McGee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josaya admits to being somewhat of a masochist and does not believe that he's trained properly, unless his legs ache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After nine days of training in Atlanta, I told Xolile (Xolile Yawa, the South African runner who withdrew from the Olympic marathon due to injury) I had to train on my own in the mornings because the training was too easy - in South Africa I could feel I was really training, because my feet were sore,&quot; Josaya explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three years before Atlanta were spent solely on training and running half-marathons and the mines and business sector took note of the dynamo who ran taxing, hilly routes with ease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Koornhof begged me to go back to them, but they still wanted me to work undergound and I couldn't do that,&quot; Josaya says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the private sector also approached him, but because he was uneducated, could not employ him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The management at Koornhof mine eventually found work which Josaya would be prepared to do and he was finally re-employed as a cleaner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But since his win, sponsorships worth thousands of rands are expected to fall in his lap and Josaya could soon become a millionaire. Will he always be a cleaner?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll still work at the mine, but I'm due to be promoted to a telephone operator,&quot; he says, with a pleased smile. Any money his Atlanta win will earn him, would simply be invested to &quot;make more money&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the possible &quot;millions&quot;, he says he's not concerned by the implications success would have on him, nor by the possibilities of being exploited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe when I have the money, I'll worry. But right now, I don't. So people can ask and ask for money, but I don't have any,&quot; he says simply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he does want, however, is both houses that have been offered to him by the Mpumalanga govenrment and Koornfontein mine. A bit of a political dispute arose over who would give Josaya a house, but he believes he could put both to good use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have two children from another woman and they need a house. I need a house too, because my blue shack is just too cold,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite soon, he might just be able to buy himself his own house - or two.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - For centuries, four pale gods reigned on the prominent rock outcrop which looms over the flat planes of Acornhoek on the border of Northern Province and Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the majestic rock mountain still dominates the landscape, but the legend of the pale gods has been dead for 30 years, since white businessmen in the area built a hotel on its slope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hotel didn't last long, but the people believed that the power of the gods had been broken, and no longer feared them,&quot; explains Petros Ndimande, a Swazi taxi tour operator from Nelspruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No longer would people mysteriously disappear when mist enshrouded the mountain at dusk and dawn, and perhaps story tellers will no longer tell the legend since its power was killed by the white man.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of legends, warns archaeologist, Sidney Miller, is a serious threat to the survival of culture and, ultimately, to economic prosperity brought by tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga MEC for Arts and Culture, Lassy Chiwayo echoes this sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to promote story-telling methods, and hotel and leisure industries can play a role in this by creating jobs for local comedians and dancers,&quot; he said at the recent Satour promotion of Mpumalanga and Northern Province as tourist destinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller, who hit the headlines when he and his team uncovered the 13th- century stone-walled trading city of Thulamela near Pafuri in the Kruger National Park last year, says instead of carving giraffes and birds, local sculptors should rediscover the craftsmanship of their Thulamela ancestors and replicate the ancient gold bracelets and beads discovered on royal skeletons on site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what Africa can give tourism - a touch of the mystical, something unique that no other country has,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporting a more controversial means of attracting tourism, Miller proposes that more archaeological sites be responsibly reconstructed in terms of the National Monuments Code of Ethics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If South America can make millions from the Aztecs, and the Egyptians can make money from stones stacked on one another, then archaeology can make a great contribution to the economy of this country,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said France &quot;bragged&quot; about its mere 470 archaeological sites, whereas South Africa had a conservative estimate of 15 000 sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa has the richest history in the world,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Mpumalanga, Northern Province and Thulamela, there was a continuous habitation over 1,5 million years,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the difference between South Africa and countries such as South America and Australia, should be that South African archaeologists reconstruct sites with the cooperation of local communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South American Indians and Aborigines have demanded the state return ancestral bones, but at Thulamela, this problem was averted because we worked with the community,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the community around Thulamela had allowed scientists and archaeologists to study royal skeletons, on condition they be reburied with the appropriate reverence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community has also, he says, formed a committee to manage funds generated by the site and to ensure all money went back into the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone participates and is proud. This is not a begging community,&quot; Miller explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also warns against communities selling original artifacts to overseas collectors and forever losing cultural heritage pieces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For R20 000, a piece is lost to someone's house overseas, whereas it could be worth more if 20 000 school children had to see and learn from it,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says artifacts, such as the Mapungubwe gold which has been locked away for 60 years, should not be hidden in university vaults, but rather displayed and protected in museums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all, to whom do these artifacts belong? We have to look at changing the law,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a serious supporter of taking tourists to living cultural sites and tribal villages, Miller also warns against disturbing tribal life where communities may instead pander to tourists, instead of giving them the genuine experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a sensitive issue and must be handled delicately,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must keep in mind that we are taking tourists into the private lives of people and must not disturb their way of life,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, he says, archaeologists take as little as possible away from sites to leave &quot;something for brighter architects in 200 years time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the mean time, sites can be used efficiently to create jobs and spin- offs for tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they should not be run by big-operators. They could be constructed in such a way that the money goes into the correct pockets,&quot; Miller says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must remember, we are touching the lives of people's ancestors, and must guard against transferring their rights,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we lose respect for the ancestors, we may lose everything.&quot; .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For any political party to be seen to be hugging with the apartheid hyena and the alleged church bombers is to invite sudden political death.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC KwaZulu Natal Caucuss has noted the statement of Mr Arthur Konnigkramer, IFP Provincial MP, accusing some members of the ANC Provincial Parliament of being responsible for violence in KwaZulu Natal with dismay and disgust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Safety and Security portfolio committee of KwaZulu Natal Legislature set up a sub-committee to investigate allegations of a &quot;no-go&quot; area in Richmond for South African Police Service. The Sub-Committee began its work last year and has heard evidence from a number of people. The Sub-Committee has yet to finalise its report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the reports submitted to the Committee was an Intelligence Report from the SANDF. The report which appears to be based on the evidence of informers, contains a number of allegations against ANC and IFP members. In the IFP the report points at the highest level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC will not sink so low as to reveal the names of the most senior IFP leaders mentioned in the Intelligence Report before the full Committee makes its final report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Subcommittee is still in the process of discussing the document and has not as yet spoken directly to the SANDF to ascertain the reliability of the information and on what basis it was compiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Subcommittee however agreed that the document is to be treated as privileged to the Sub-Committee until decided otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Konnigkrammer has by releasing selective details of the report, shown his contempt for the Sub-Committee and his lack of commitment to ensuring that the Sub-Committee completes its task and the problem of no-go areas is effectively addressed. He has virtually jeopardised the the work of the Sub- Committee and that of delivering peace in KwaZulu Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC leadership will raise this problem created by Arthur Konnigkramer to the IFP leadership.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART I - HIGHLIGHTS (Details below in Part II)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Eastern Zaire a) Refugees abandon Tingi Tingi camps on 28 February, and head into the forest; some reported moving towards Kisangani and Ubundu. b) Zaire Government reacts to evacuation of aid agencies from Kisangani and orders expulsion of international UN and non-governmental organization (NGO) staff from the country. c) Refugees of Shabunda and Kalima camps reportedly on their way to Punia. d) WFP makes arrangements with the Catholic mission to continue food distributions to internally displaced persons and newly arriving refugees in Kisangani and to refugees in Punia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Rwanda a) Food deliveries improve; UN aid convoys operate under military escort between Kigali and Cyangugu, Kibuye, Gisenyi and Ruhengeri. b) Some 428,000 persons, mostly returnees, benefit from food distributions in the period 24 February to 2 March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Burundi a) WFP together with NGOs is undertaking a food and seed distribution operation in many parts of the country. b) Increased security incidents in Bujumbura, attributed to rebels hiding within internally displaced person sites around the city, leads to forced movement of people away from the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Tanzania a) Kigoma refugee population now at over a quarter of a million and influx continues at steady rate. b) In drought-affected regions, cereal prices are increasing daily, while in some of the worst affected areas, livestock is sharply declining in value to a fraction of usual prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Update a) Numbers of affected Ugandans rapidly increasing at a time when food resourcing situation reaches alarming levels. b) FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission preliminary results indicate that rapidly deteriorating security situation in northern and eastern districts of Uganda has resulted in a doubling of food prices. c) Constraints on WFP local purchase of food commodities because of impending shortages affects supply of food to Sudanese refugees in the north of Uganda, which had been based mainly on local purchases. Food stocks will be depleted end-March and resources are urgently required to cover needs of 230,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. SAHEL - CHAD, MAURITANIA AND NIGER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Update a) WFP emergency operation approved for Chad (EMOP 5798) to cover needs resulting from crop failure due to drought. Food requirements are 7,700 metric tons for 356,000 beneficiaries for three months. b) Another drought emergency operation (EMOP 5819) is under preparation to provide 16,560 metric tons food aid for 200,000 beneficiaries in Mauritania for six months. c) Harvest in Niger reported as average, but some areas of the country have been without rain for a second consecutive year. WFP is targeting most vulnerable zones under its existing development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. MOZAMBIQUE AND MALAWI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Impact of floods a) WFP Southern Africa cluster, headquarters Maputo, is assessing the effect of severe flooding in February in Mozambique and Malawi.  WFP response will be on a regional basis. b) In Mozambique, immediate food needs are under control. An FAO/WFP crop assessment mission in April will establish the numbers of people affected by the impact on crops and resources required to respond to needs, but it is expected that no food imports will be required. c) DHA situation reports on Malawi and Mozambique available on ReliefWeb at http://www.reliefweb.int/ (click on Emergencies).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. EASTERN ZAIRE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Expatriate staff from aid agencies were evacuated from Kisangani to Kinshasa on 1 March. This precautionary measure was dictated by signs of increased insecurity and operational difficulties related to military activities. The Government of Zaire strongly condemned the temporary withdrawal of aid agencies from Kisangani and retaliated by ordering the expulsion from the country of staff previously based in Kisangani. The UN is adhering to the expulsion order made by the Government, thus leaving the door open for further negotiations. UN expelled staff were expected to go to Brazzaville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) WFP has made arrangements with the Catholic mission to continue food distributions to internally displaced persons and newly arriving refugees in Kisangani and to refugees in Punia. WFP local staff will continue to assist this operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) Refugee camps in Tingi Tingi have emptied. On 28 February, fearing that the rebels were fast closing in, the 160,000 refugees hurriedly left the camps. The rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) are reported to have taken the camp, its airport and the nearby town of Lubutu, on the following day, 1 March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d) After deserting the Tingi Tingi camps, refugees started walking in different directions, some towards Kisangani. In an effort to try to prevent the refugees from reaching Kisangani, Zairean authorities tried to divert movement towards Ubundu, a river port on the left bank of the Zaire River, but some refugees have started to arrive in Kisangani, on trucks hired by WFP for food deliveries and returning from the Lubutu area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e) An average of 4,000 displaced Zaireans a day are arriving in Kisangani, joining some 31,000 already in town. Food distribution by WFP national staff in collaboration with the Catholic Mission is scheduled to continue to the internally displaced persons and arriving refugees. WFP food stocks in Kisangani as of 4 March amounted to 409 metric tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">f) Refugees who had left the former camps of Shabunda and Kalima are reported to be now on their way to Punia. Some 5,000 refugees were already gathered in Punia and an estimated 10,000 more are heading towards this town, 300 km south-east of Kisangani. The WFP plane was able to deliver 12 metric tons of food to Punia, for distribution by the Catholic mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">g) Some 8,000 Zairean refugees have arrived in northern Zambia in recent weeks, entering through Mpulungu, via Lake Tanganyika. The refugees are accommodated in Kasama and Mbala. WFP has positioned 400 metric tons of food commodities in Kigoma, Tanzania, for onward transportation by lake barge to Zambia. WFP has also airlifted to Kasama 11 metric tons of non-food items for UNHCR from Mwanza in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">h) An Ilyushin 76 is on stand by in Mwanza to resume airlifts into Zaire when circumstances permit. Air capacity in Kisangani for movements inside Zaire includes one Andover, capacity 6 metric tons, one DC3, capacity 3 metric tons and one Aztec with a capacity for 5 passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Goma</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) UN agencies and NGOs are discussing assistance plans for local affected populations. Assessment exercises will be carried out to determine numbers and locations of people in need, with WFP taking the lead in this process.  Aid agencies remaining in Goma include MSF-Holland, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Catholic Relief Services, Save the Children, Oxfam, UNICEF, UNHCR and WFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) WFP has handed over the management of nutritional centres in Goma to UNICEF. There are presently 13 centres with 620 children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Bukavu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Aid agencies have drafted a plan of activities to be carried out at transit centres and assistance points along the Bukavu/Kingulube road.  Responsibilities will be shared among various agencies: SCF for nutrition, MSF/IRC for health and Care International for logistics. Between 24 February and 2 March, distribution of 1.5 metric tons of high protein biscuits at way stations along the Walungu/Bunyakiri axis benefited 1,102 returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 Regular UN aid convoys under military escort have started running between Kigali and Cyangugu, Kibuye, Gisenyi and Ruhengeri. Seven UN vehicles have been provided for these escorts. Regular flights to Gisenyi and Cyangugu have also been started by WFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Rwandan refugees continue returning from eastern Zaire. Between 24 February and 2 March 1,392 returnees came back via Cyangugu and 446 via Gisenyi. The recent upsurge in fighting in eastern Zaire is expected to result in increased repatriation. Over the past week 111 returnees came from Tanzania and 13 new refugees arrived from Burundi. In the same period, 1,745 Burundians returned to their country from Kibangira camp in Cyangugu prefecture. Another 2,400 Burundian refugees remain in that camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 WFP is continuing efforts to speed up food distributions to returnees and to persons who have had to leave homes and land they were occupying due to the arrival of some of the returnees. Planned beneficiary figures for the months of March and April have been submitted to WFP by the National and Prefecture Food Committees. WFP has set a limit of 1.5 million beneficiaries for logistical and development reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 From 24 February to 2 March WFP distributed 2,678 metric tons of food to 428,000 beneficiaries. This represents a significant increase in deliveries as compared to February averages, when insecurity hampered access of convoys to many areas. Most distributions benefited returnees (65%), but also food-for-work programmes (25%), institutional feeding (5%) and targeted assistance programmes (5%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 The seed distribution programme coordinated by FAO continues. In total WFP and NGOs will distribute 1,100 metric tons of seeds while the Government of Burundi will distribute 400 metric tons. Following joint assessments by WFP, FAO, NGOs and the Government, seed distributions were undertaken in Cibitoke, Bubanza, and Kayanza. Food distributions by WFP and NGOs are being undertaken simultaneously to minimize the risk that the seeds may be used for consumption, rather than for planting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 Teams conducting the joint UNICEF/FAO/DHA/WFP study of displaced populations went to sites in the provinces of Kayanza, Gitega, Muramvya, Makomba and Cibitoke during the past week. In addition to assessing food needs, the study examines the living conditions of these populations, including housing, water and sanitation, health, and access to education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 The security situation in the city of Bujumbura has worsened with recent incidents increasing. Concern is growing over the security risks posed by sites around the city holding internally displaced persons, such as the Johnson Centre, fuelled by accusations that rebels being harboured at these sites. The Minister of the Interior announced that several of the sites will be closed and the residents returned to their hills of origin. Observers who visited the places in question over the weekend confirmed that residents were in fact being moved out of the sites and that there are plans to move out another 4,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.4 Mr. Martin Griffiths, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes Region, has highlighted the concern of the international community in Burundi about the Government of Burundi's policy of regroupment, indicating that possibly up to 500,000 civilians might be affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 Refugee situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) The refugee influx into Kigoma continues at 1,000 to 1,500 persons per day. The total refugee population in Kigoma has reached 254,000, while the total refugee caseload for Tanzania is now over 350,000. In Kasulu district, the refugee population now equals the local population. The transfer of 15, 000 refugees from holding centres to the new Lugufu camp has temporarily relieved crowding at the three centres in Kigoma. Poor road conditions and inadequate transportation continue to disrupt food deliveries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) A mission made up of the Government of Tanzania and senior representatives of UN agencies and donors visited Kigoma region 3-6 March.  The visit is to followed in the immediate future by a technical mission which will identify how populations in the areas of the refugee camps may be assisted to alleviate the impact of the presence of the high numbers of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 Impact of drought</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) In drought-affected regions, cereal prices are increasing daily while livestock prices in some drought affected areas have dramatically dropped.  Reports from north-eastern and Lake Victoria regions indicate that pastoralists are now so concerned by the complete lack of grazing and water that they are willing to sell cattle for 5,000 to 10,000 TZ SHS per head - twelve to fifteen times less than the normal prices of 70,000 TO 110,000 TZ SHS per head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Drought assessment teams will visit priority areas between 10 and 25 March. These have been identified as Arusha and Kilimanjaro in the north-east coast area, Lindi in the east/south, Morogoro in the west, Dodoma, Singida, Tabora and Shinyanga in the central area and Mwanza and Mara in the Lake Victoria area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The food resourcing situation for the Uganda programme has reached an alarming level, at a time when the number of affected people in need of immediate food assistance is likely to double.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 An impending shortage of local food crops, due mostly to insecurity, has seriously affected the supply of food to Sudanese refugees in the north of Uganda. This supply was programmed mainly on local purchases. Food stocks for 230,000 Sudanese refugees under the WFP protracted relief operation PRO 5623 will be depleted end-March. The large balance of uncommitted resources for this operation needs to be mobilised and shipped immediately to avoid a prolonged interruption in distribution and increased malnutrition, already prevalent in most refugee settlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 At the same time, the number of internally displaced in Kitgum and Gulu in northern Uganda is on the rise due to the continued insurgency, which has also prevented the internally displaced population from planting this season's crop. It is critical that the recently approved emergency operation to assist 110,000 persons (EMOP 5816) gets resourced fully on an urgent basis.  The EMOP, currently covering needs for a six-month period, may need to be expanded until the displaced can harvest their next crop in February 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Preliminary information from the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission indicates that the rapidly deteriorating security situation in northern and eastern districts of Uganda has resulted in food prices doubling, exceeding the purchasing capacity of the average consumer.  Food reserves are expected to decrease further in the lean season with the number of affected people rising accordingly. Details of the findings of the Mission will be made available when the Report is finalized and released by FAO and WFP. The Report will be accessible on the Internet at http://www.fao.  org (click on Global Watch, then GIEWS, Special Reports).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. SAHEL - CHAD, MAURITANIA AND NIGER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Poor cereal harvests have resulted from rainfall shortages in the Sahelian regions of Chad, Mauritania and Niger. Under an emergency crop failure assistance project (EMOP 5798) approved on 3 March, WFP will provide 7,700 metric tons of food commodities for 356,000 beneficiaries in Chad. This three-month operation is expected to be implemented immediately. WFP is preparing an emergency operation (EMOP 5819) to provide 16,560 metric tons of food aid for 200,000 beneficiaries in Mauritania through a six-month emergency drought mitigation project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 While the harvest in Niger was near average, some areas of the country have not received rain for the second consecutive year. WFP has reinforced activities under its existing development projects, which are targeted at the most vulnerable zones and populations, to respond to the situation. WFP is also working in close collaboration with NGOs for the implementation of health projects and vaccination campaigns in vulnerable regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 WFP has taken action to establish a regional cluster office in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. This office will coordinate WFP assistance throughout the Sahel Region. The office is expected to be operational by the beginning of the second semester of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. MOZAMBIQUE AND MALAWI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. IMPACT OF FLOODS</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The Zairean Ministry of Defence said there had been violent clashes with rebels on Thursday, near Panga, some 80 kilometers northeast of Kisangani. A statement said 114 rebels from the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) had been killed. The government said its soldiers had repelled another attack in the area, killing seven rebels.  It is the first time the defense ministry has acknowledged the presence of rebels close to Kisangani, reports AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan favours a political solution for the Zairean crisis, including a ceasefire, with protection for aid workers and refugees. UN Spokesman Fred Eckhard said the Secretary-General met with Joint OAU/UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region Mohamed Sahnoun on Thursday. Sahnoun is expected to attend the briefing of the UN Security Council today, with Martin Griffiths, Humanitarian Coordiator for the Great Lakes Region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Punia, eastern Zaire, is reported by Reuters to be under the armed occupation of Hutu soldiers of the former Rwandan army. Half the estimated 100,000 civilian polulation of the town and its surroundings have fled from harassment and stealing by the ex-FAR, says a correspondent in Punia.  Rwandans fear the arrival of the ADFL, which has made rapid gains in the area.  Rwandan refugees in Punia said they were planning to leave soon, as the rebels &quot;have been killing refugees&quot;. Local gendarmarie have disarmed and disappeared, according to the report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Only a few dozen sick and dying Rwandans remain in Tingi-Tingi camps, eastern Zaire, reports AP. Rebels distributed small amounts of food, and said the UN should help repatriate those left in the camp. Journalists were barred from entering the camp by rebel commander Jonathan Ndironsonga, who refused to discuss what happened during the takeover. AP quotes a refugee - whose circumstances are not explained - as saying the camp was empty when rebels arrived, but that fleeing refugees were pursued for four miles to the town of Lubutu &quot;where we were stopped&quot;. The refugee alledged &quot;more than 100&quot; were then killed. There was no sign of the bodies of 25,000 refugees the Zairean government says were killed when the ADFL took the camp last Saturday, report AP, and &quot;no stench of death&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The outgoing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Jose Ayala Lasso, appealed to donors on Thursday to fund the deployment of observers to eastern Zaire to investigate reports of alleged massacres of Rwandan refugees by rebels. In a United Nations statement Lasso said he was deeply concerned by reports from human rights groups alleging the existence of mass graves in east Zaire, near former refugee camps for Rwandans and Burundians. Lasso has asked the UN's Special Human Rights Investigator for Zaire, Roberto Garreton, to investigate the massacre allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Kenyan government will host a summit on the conflict on eastern Zaire, on March 19, but will not invite rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila, the Minstry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday. Spokesman David Kikaya told Reuters that the purpose of the summit was to &quot;advance the search for peace and a lasting solution&quot;. He said Kabila had not been invited because it was a head of state summit. Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko has been invited to attend, with President Mandela and five other heads of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters says that Kabila's search for international recognition was &quot; crowned in Johannesburg on February 29 when he had an hour of talks with Mandela&quot;, Africa's most respected statesman. On Thursday, President Moi was reported in the local press as expressing concern &quot;over the sincerity of leaders involved in the Great Lakes region conflict talks&quot;. He said he would make his position clear at a regional meeting on March 19. Moi's announcement of the March 19 summit is seen to be an attempt to regain the diplomatic initiative in the eastern Zaire crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette on Thursday accused Uganda of supporting Zairean rebels. The Foreign Minister indicated that France would not intervene alone in Zaire, but feels that the key to halting the conflict may lie with the US which has close ties with Uganda and Rwanda. French analysts said the government believed the United States was trying to edge it out of the last region where France still wielded influence from a colonial past, reports Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere says Zaire and its people should be looking to life beyond their sick president Mobutu Sese Seko, saying &quot;the poor man is going&quot;. He said that the days of the &quot;big man&quot; in African politics were over. He was giving his views in a television interview, while attending celebrations in Accra, marking 40 years of Ghana's independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Martin Griffiths, Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes region has said the policy of regroupment in Burundi is one of &quot;deep concern to which the international community should be fundamentally opposed&quot;.  Regroupment represents a military strategy by the Burundian authorities against rebel insurgency, and will affect up to 500,000 civilians, according to the authorities. 200,000 people are in camps in provinces where there is conflict. Griffiths reported seeing degrees of malnutrition in children he described as &quot;disgraceful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy is not based on voluntary movement by the regrouped, as those who do not comply may be considered as rebels or supporters of rebels. The Burundian authorities, however, say it is voluntary and temporary measure, and that the security of people cannot be otherwise assured by the State in areas of conflict. The authorities say most of the camps are expected to be closed by June, and have requested humanitarian assistance. Griffiths said humanitarian agencies &quot;face the dilema of how to meet the needs of those in the camp without having the effect of encouraging or supporting the military policy&quot;. While donors and agencies agree that the policy is to be deplored, there are differing opinions on how to meet the humanitarian needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Griffiths called on behalf of aid agencies to exempt humanitarian assistance from sanctions imposed on Burundi by its neighbouring states.  Asking that regional and local sanctions committees act expediently on UN requests for fuel and assistance, Griffiths said the supplies &quot;are indispensable simply to continue delivering aid&quot;. Despite requests made by the UN on 18 November, no fuel has yet reached agencies in Burundi. A press statement issued by the Regional Humanitarian Coordinator has been circulated through IRIN today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Burundi's Radio Umwizero (Radio Hope), which broadcasts a message of ethnic tolerance and reconciliation, has been threatened by extremists.  Pierre Pradier, general secretary of the Paris-based Association for Humanitarian Action, said Radio Umwizero had been told to sack the radio's franchise holder for his alleged sympathies with Hutu rebels. The radio station employs about 20 local journalists, and is funded by the European Union. There is a proposal by UNESCO to create a Great Lakes regional radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNICEF Director Carol Bellamy yesterday condemned the abduction of up to 10,000 children by the Lords Resistance Army in northern Uganda, and called for their immediate release. In a statement issued from New York, Bellamy said that captives were often tortured, and those caught trying escape were killed. Girls are sexually abused by soldiers and are given as &quot;wives&quot; in lieu of other forms of payment. The statement called for concerted international pressure, and said the problem was &quot;neither to big nor too complex to solve&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Radio Rwanda said yesterday more than 50 people, alledgedly implicated in the murder of five UN Human Rights field officers, had surrendered to the authorities in southwest Rwanda. It said Gahutu - said to have masterminded the murders - and his accomplices were an important factor in insecurity in Bugumya sub-prefecture and Cyangugu Prefecture. They operated from the Nyungwe forest and retreating to Burundi to reorganise. Those who had surrendered had also handed over military equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda agreed on Thursday to take steps to locate and protect defence witnesses thought to have fled the Tingi- Tingi camps in eastern Zaire last week. The decision follows a request by the lawyer of Georges Rutaganda, former Interahamwe leader, to get &quot;special protection&quot; for 16 defence witnesses. Tirbunal president Laity Kama ordered the court clerk to seek the help of the countries and humanitarian organisations concerned, notably UNHCR, to track down and protect the witnesses. The decision was broadcast by independent Agatashya radio in Arusha, Tanzania, where the Tribunal sits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ethiopia - which has suffered major famines for decades - is for the first time exporting maize for relief purposes. A convoy of 32 lorries carrying 1,246 metric tons has been purchased by the World Food Programme to feed about 40,000 people in Kenya for one month. The majority of relief food under WFP's drought operation for Kenya will go to an estimated 207,000 people in drought-stricken areas of Garissa, Mandera, Wajir, Isiolo and Marsabit in North Eastern and Eastern Provinces.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The leader of the rebel group, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), Laurent-Desire Kabila, said on Saturday that he was ready to negotiate a ceasefire along the lines of the proposed UN peace plan, reports AFP, but he refused to stop his westward push on Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila told reporters at the weekend that several columns of rebel troops had surrounded Kisangani and that they were meeting fierce resistence, mainly from ex-FAR who are fighting alongside Zairean government troops. Until Saturday, Kabila had refused to discuss a ceasefire. His about-face came after the UN Security Council called on Friday for the rebels to &quot;declare publicly&quot; their acceptance of a truce. The Government of Zaire accepted the peace plan on Wednesday and has called for international observers to be deployed immediately to monitor the withdrawal of foreign troops. The five point plan provides for an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal of foreign troops and mercenaries, negotations, elections and the protection of refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An inter-agency emergency relief programme for Tingi-Tingi camp and Amisi in eastern Zaire is expected to start within the next few days. A UN-NGO inter-agency mission which flew into Tingi-Tingi yesterday reports that the condition of the refugees is extremely poor and that many would probably die within days. Some 600 - 1,000 refugees were seen in Tingi-Tingi and others are trickling in from the surrounding forest. Many had fled the camp on 1 and 2 March just before it was taken by the ADFL. The refugees claim that there are &quot;thousands more refugees&quot; in the forest and that thousands had fled eastwards on the Walikale road. Sources said that the ADLF has given assurances that aid workers can return and assist the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission, led by UNHCR and accompanied by the UN Regional Humanitarian Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, also overflew Amisi and observed some 250 refugees. During the overflight of parts of the road between Walikale and Lubutu, no other significant numbers of people were seen. Filippo Grandi, UNHCR Head of Sub-Office and Field Coordinator for the region - Zone 2 said: &quot; Many of the refugees we saw were elderly or women and children. Most are sick or wounded. All of them are exhausted and want to go home quickly&quot;. In addition to emergency assistance, plans are being put in place with the ADLF to reopen road access between Tingi-Tingi and Bukavu and to establish transit centres to facilitate repatriation to Rwanda. Some of the weakest will be flown back to Rwanda. This was the first time rebels have allowed humanitarian officials to approach the front-line to look for refugees. Tingi- Tingi camp housed between 160,000 - 170,000 refugees before being overrun by rebels ten days ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Britain and the United States have effectively &quot;killed off&quot; proposals for a multi-national force to protect refugees in eastern Zaire, reports AFP. UN Secretary-General Kofi Anann had tried to resurrect the proposal after talks in Paris with French leaders, but both the US and British Governments have rejected it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The World Food Programme delivered on Saturday some 65 tonnes of food for thousands of Rwandan refugees who have arrived in the town of Ubundu from Tingi-Tingi camp. The food was transported by train from Kisangani. Relief workers who tried to distribute the food were &quot;overwhelmed&quot;, AFP reported.  Another 120 tonnes of food was expected to be dispatched today. An airlift of high protein biscuits was also planned but the plane was unable to take off because of heavy rain. As many as 20,000 had arrived in the town as of Sunday and a further 20,000 were expected today. Refugees in Ubundu said that many thousands of refugees were fleeing 140 kilometers west of Ubundu to Opala - a perilous journey that covers swampy terrain and dense forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The French Secretary of State for emergency humanitarian affairs, Xavier Emmanuelli visited Ubundu on Sunday and said that the refugees faced death through starvation, illness, or at the hands of rebels if they did not receive aid urgently. Emmanuelli was due to leave for Kinshasa for a meeting with the Zairean Government later today. At the weekend acommunique from the French Foreign Ministry called on &quot;all those who have influence over&quot; the rebels to use it to obtain an end to the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to the Daily Nation newspaper, Uganda claims that it has driven rebels of the Lord's Resistence Army (LRA) back to Sudan but says that it continues to be on the alert against counter-attacks. Uganda's Minister of State for Defence said that Uganda believed that the rebels &quot;would be rearmed by their Sudanese backers&quot;, but heavy deployment of government troops in the north of the country would counter any attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* HIV infection is declining in parts of Uganda. A report, compiled by the Ministry of Health's STD/AIDS Control Programme in October, but only recently released, says that researchers monitoring infection amongst pregnant women at six hospitals between 1991 and 1995 report that in two hospitals the average rates dropped from 27.8% and 22% in 1991-1992 to 16.8% and 13% in 1993-1995 respectively. Only at one hospital was the decrease insignificant.  In spite of the decrease, overall, statistics for Uganda and Africa remain grim. WHO says that there are about 14 million people with HIV in Africa, some 63% of all cases worldwide. It is estimated that there are 1.5 million infected Ugandans. In addition, while infection rates have dropped in urban areas, they are increasing in villages, particularly in areas plagued by civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The recent decision by Brussels to halt the construction of a bullet factory in Kenya arose from differences with the Kenyan government over an end-user agreement for munitions, reports the &quot;East African&quot;. The decision to suspend the US$ 26.7 million project - partly financed by a Belgium firm - followed concerns that bullets from the factory could reach the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rwanda's national assembly has elected Joseph Sebarenze of the Liberal Party as speaker to replace Juvenal Nkusi, a Social Democrat who was ousted on 10 February. Jacqueline Muhongayire from the Social Democrat Party was elected deputy speaker. Nkusi was voted out of office when he followed President Pasteur Bizimungu in refusing to sign a bill which would allow the national assembly to exert control over the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rinderpest, a highly infectious cattle disease, is threatening livestock and wildlife in northern Tanzania, the official Shihata news agency reported on Sunday. The reports says that Tanzania needs US$ 3 million to fight the epidemic. A vaccination campaign is already underway.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Backed by leading financial institutions, a new micro-business support corporation is to seek a listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Micro Business Development Corporation has been set up as a public company to provide working capital for small entrepreneurs while at the same time providing investors with a sound investment and market-related profits.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Tony Davenport said at the weekend this was the first institution of its kind in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hitherto South Africa has largely ignored the micro-enterprise sector of the economy, but it is now being realised that self-employment in this sector is the only hope for millions of people who cannot find jobs in the formal sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the past, micro-enterprise development has been regarded as a handout affair, reliant on donor-funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the time has come for this sector of the economy to expand on a sound business basis - not looking for charity, but instead offering an excellent investment opportunity,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Davenport said experience over several years had shown that large numbers of people were willing and able to be self-employed in micro- enterprises if they had training and access to capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The success of the so-called township MBA programme and the Start-Up Fund has proved this.&quot; The corporation is being advised by Boland Financial Services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A public mood swing from the paralysis of foreboding to joyous optimism is a wonderful thing to behold; a fragile, transient thing too, but a powerful gift to be treasured and used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have experienced many such moments in our tumultuous recent past - the pre-election peace day, the election itself, the inauguration, the unlikely sporting triumphs - and this weekend it was the turn of Cape Town to give the lead to the entire country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this Monday morning in the late summer of 1997 it is not our problems which are uppermost in the minds of the people of our region, it is our opportunities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full meaning of Cape Town's shortlisting for the Olympic Games of 2004 is beginning to sink in. More than anything else, that meaning is this: the bitter argument over whether we are capable of hosting the Games is over.  Cold-eyed experts from other shores have declared that we are and they cannot afford to lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of the next six months is whether we really want to host them and, as a corollary, whether we deserve them. The auguries were marvellous on Friday as the signs of resurgent South African self-belief burst loudly to the surface. It is true: the mood is swinging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the Cape Argus/Pick 'n Pay Cycle Tour took place with spectacular success and in blessed weather directly after the outpouring of delight over the Lausanne announcement was a serendipitous bonus. A wonderfully-organised event with a unique South African flavour - it was a microcosm of the first African Games, and make no mistake that the people felt it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Argus stands proud of its longstanding belief in our people's ability to take on the world, even when that view was out of kilter with the general mood. And we hand out some mighty claps on the back for this battle won in preparation for the war. Congratulations to Chris Ball and his team for their effort and forebearance. To the government and sporting figures who supported the Bid so passionately and professionally. And, let us never forget, to Raymond Ackerman the dreamer. Our team starts playing the real Game on a happy high.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - At the age of 65 Josephine Cooke is not about to step into retirement. There's just too much to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now she's president of a mortgage services company, she's president of Zonta (a women's service organisation with 35 000 members in 68 countries), she sits on the Sex Equity Commission in Los Angeles and sings soprano in her church choir (when at home). This woman is busy. And then there are the &quot; personal missions&quot; she still has to tackle, she says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of these is to get the medical world to take notice of the fact that's she alive. Ms Cooke has sickle cell anaemia, and according to medical science she should be dead at her age. &quot;I was sickly all my life,&quot; she says, &quot;I didn't make 100 pounds, and I thought pain was a way of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors gave me blood transfusions and told me not to fly above a certain height. Then a doctor put me on sodium bicarbonate tablets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its a rarity to be 65, and healthy, with sickle cell anaemia. And now I fly halfway around the world! I've tried to get the medical community to listen to me, they just say take it if you want to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she's determined not to give up, and has found a doctor willing to do tests on her. &quot;I think I have a mission. That's why I'm still here,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Cooke is in Cape Town to charter the first Zonta club in South Africa.  That's her privilege as president. It's also given her a chance to see first- hand the educational projects Zonta supports through its two-year South African girls education programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zonta's mission is to advance the position of women and since its establishment in 1919 its objectives have stayed much the same. There's been some modernising but no compromising, says Ms Cooke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How far has Zonta's mission been realised?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we've made much progress around the world, in some countries more than others. We have much, much more to do. In my lifetime we've seen major improvements for women. But there are always new walls and ceilings being built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to have our minds open, and be flexible. For instance, in Holland there have been 20 incidents in the last year of fathers killing their children because they couldn't get custody. That's a new issue in the 90s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Cooke defends charges of Zonta being an elitist organisation of executive and professional women in business. &quot;It's not,&quot; she says. &quot;Our aims are lofty. But our foremothers in 1919 set the tone and we see no reason to change it. If we're going to get something done this is the expertise we need to bring women who are not yet professionals into the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Zonta net draws in high school girls and members from other areas, such as people active in their community, volunteers and home makers.  Visiting schools in South Africa has been an eye opener, says Ms Cooke. Zonta International has pledged $35 000 (R157 000) to improve education in South Africa for the girl child working in partnership with Unicef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course boys will also benefit. It's really about children. I was very touched, very moved with what I saw and the extent of support needed. And that's more than academic needs, more than curricula needs. There are socio- economic problems that are a deterrent to a good education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I left knowing what a tremendous job we have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zonta International recognises the enormous problem of violence against women and has started an ongoing, self-administered project to tackle the problem. The first stage of the programme will be a resource centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to build a database and organise around the world, exchange information and ideas, have material available. We want to establish an advisory council, look for those people committed to removing this stigma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We fully understand that a lot of this violence is considered to be cultural, and we understand you can't go out and fight that with a stick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Cooke started her working life teaching functionally illiterate adults.  In the late 40s, teaching and nursing were the options for black women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ill health prevented her from becoming a nurse, so teaching it was until she left Pennsylvania for Los Angeles and found a job in the mortgage banking world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has no hesitation in saying that affirmative action got her where she is today. &quot;When I moved I needed a job. In the late 60s affirmative action was introduced. I was in the right place at the right time and I got a job. I applied myself and in two years was vice-president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affirmative action is a good thing, she believes. &quot;Maybe we have to change the name of affirmative action, the perception of it. It must continue as it offers an opportunity to open doors to people who have been deprived previously. But once in the door there should be the requirement to perform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a requirement Josie Cooke has more than fulfilled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The hugely successful 20th Cape Argus/Pick 'n Pay Cycle Tour on Sunday showed that Cape Town had the capacity to host major events, said Olympic 2004 bid chief Chris Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 28 000 starters made it the biggest sporting event of of its kind in the world, just two days after the shortlisting of Cape Town, Rome, Athens, Buenos Aires and Stockholm as potential host cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ball, who flew back from Lausanne to be at the finish, said it was such events as the cycle tour that set Cape Town apart from the other shortlisted cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's ability to organise huge sporting events would play a key role in the final presentation to the International Olympic Committee in September, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Straight after his arrival from Switzerland, Mr Ball flew from Cape Town International Airport by helicopter to address the thousands assembled for the tour awards ceremony in Camps Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cape Town's inclusion on the Olympic host city shortlist for 2004 is a confirmation that the IOC believes the Mother City can successfully host the greatest sporting spectacle in the world,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bid company was entering a new phase of its campaign to market the city as the 2004 venue. &quot;The IOC has accepted our plans fully and they certainly would not have put us on the shortlist had they not believed we could host the Olympics, but now the hard work really begins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there had never been a doubt in his mind that Cape Town would be on the shortlist. &quot;It is now up to us to attract more visitors to the city so they can fall in love with it. This is integral to the city's chances of securing the bid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the trophies were handed to the tour winners, Mr Ball congratulated the organisers, sponsors and especially the volunteers, whom he called &quot;the silent army&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tour would be among events featured in the bid company's final presentation to the IOC on September 5, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metropolitan mayor William Bantom, who also returned from Lausanne yesterday, said he was &quot;extremely excited and relieved&quot; at Cape Town's shortlisting. &quot;As you can imagine ,it was a very tense time while we were in Lausanne but now we realise that the hard work begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is talking about the chances of Rome and Athens being very good compared to Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm of the opinion we are all in the starting-blocks now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe Cape Town has a very good chance of convincing the IOC to vote for us if you look at what we have got, in the physical sense, the beauty of the city, and the capability of our city to deliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politically I'm convinced we are in a very good position to persuade the IOC members from Africa they need to vote for Cape Town and Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The success of the cycle tour demonstrated to the world that the people of Cape Town were capable of staging world events, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Morris reports that the bid company went into a strategy meeting first thing today to begin planning the nitty-gritty of the crucial lobbying phase that will continue until September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team, some of whose members returned yesterday from Lausanne, is riding a wave of optimism after Cape Town's shortlist selection but is mindful that a huge effort will be required to convince the IOC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key target will be raising funds at home for an extensive showcasing programme - the team is hoping to get all 108 voting IOC members to visit the city in the next six months to convince them of Cape Town's capacity to stage the Games.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report No. 25 Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, March 7, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South Kivu, Zaire, and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire, more than 200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995 as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe) targeted the Banyarwanda in an apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South Kivu began to resemble that of the Masisi region, as government-sanctioned harassment of Banyamulenge Tutsis intensified. On October 14, fighting broke out between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near Runingo refugee camp, in South Kivu, forcing the roughly 220,000 refugees to flee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance), led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from Uvira to Bukavu, and south from Rutshuru (North Kivu) to Goma. As a result of shelling October 26 and November 1, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kibumba, Katale, and Kahindo camps, near Goma, fled south to Mugunga camp. After Hutu attacks from Mugunga camp on Goma town, the Alliance counter-attacked from the east on November 14, forcing the ex-FAR and Interahamwe to retreat west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to return to Rwanda, while others fled north and west into Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last three months, the Alliance has continued its advances in Eastern Zaire, most recently capturing the towns of Kindu and Manono in the south, and Lubutu and Tingi-Tingi camp in the north. It controls an area about 1,280 km long, and has driven as deep as 400 km westward into Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Humanitarian Assistance for Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 (to date): $125,348, 351</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected Rwandan refugees: From November through December 1996, 1, 033,405 Rwandan refugees returned from Eastern Zaire and Tanzania to Rwanda, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  Another 232,000 Rwandans reportedly have returned from Eastern Zaire and Tanzania this year. The UNHCR claims there are up to 376,590 Rwandans stranded in Eastern Zaire, including at least 160,000 who fled last weekend from Tingi-Tingi to Ubundu, 150 km south of Kisangani, and towards Kisangani.  There are about 125,000 others dispersed in smaller groups in South Kivu and Maniema provinces, including 40,000 refugees who abandoned Shabunda before it was overrun by the Alliance on February 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. officials reported that 25,000 of the Shabunda refugees, some Burundian, fled to Kalima, 145 kmeast of Kindu, and continued west shortly before Kalima fell tothe Alliance on February 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whereabouts of the other 5,000 is unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 20,000 refugees and internally displacedpersons (IDPs) have gathered in Punia, Maniema province,and more refugees are reportedly headed there from Kalima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees: Of the 143,000 Burundian refugees originallyin the Uvira area, some 64,000 refugees have returned to Burundi and about 13,500 have arrived in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR states that 39,675 refugees are missing, with many believed to between Fizi and Kalemie, in Zaire. There are 272,500 Burundian refugees in Tanzania, and 5,100 in Rwanda. A small number of Burundians are returning daily to Burundi from the Ngara camps in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairian refugees and internally displaced: 77,650 Zairians have fled to Tanzania, and in Rwanda there are 13,959 Zairians whofled the Masisi region last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 11,000 Zairians are reported in Uganda, about 4,000 fewer than in the last week of February, the UNHCR reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Kindu fell to the Alliance, there were about 19,000 IDPs in Kindu and more than 12,000 IDPs in Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, about 7,500 Zairian refugees have fled to Zambia, most of them arriving in Mpulungu. The Government of Sudan has appealed for UNHCR aid to assist the 10,000 Zairian refugees it reports are in the Bazi area of Western Equatoria. The number of displaced Zairians grows as theAlliance continues its advances and the FAZ retreats, looting everything in its path. Current Situation The Alliance overran the Tingi-Tingi camps on March 1, causing the roughly 160,000 refugees to abandon the area before the rebels arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 4, a news report quoted local witnesses who claimed that some of the Tingi-Tingi refugees had walked to the Ubundu region, about 150 km south of Kisangani, while others were seen walking toward Kisangani, 200 km northwest of Tingi- Tingi. On March 2, Alliance leader Laurent Kabila appealed to the U.N. to help the Tingi-Tingi refugees. In Maniema province, the Alliance flew journalists to Kindu, whichit seized on February 28, to prove its control of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 5, the Alliance rejected calls for a ceasefire until theGovernment of Zaire (GOZ) agreed to face-to-face negotiations. Earlier that day, the GOZ requested the urgent implementation ofaU.N. peace plan, endorsed by the Security Council on February 18. It calls for an immediate end to hostilities; the withdrawal of all external forces, including mercenaries; the reaffirmation of respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and other states of the region; protection and security of all refugees and displaced persons, and the facilitation of access for humanitarian assistance; the rapid settlement of the crisis through dialogue and elections; and the convening of an international conference on peace, security, and development in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution follows a plan advanced by Mohammed Sahnoun, the joint U.N. - Organizationof African States (OAU) special representative for the Great Lakes, and a Security Council statement made on February 7. The U.N.  evacuated its 19 workers from Kisangani to Kinshasa on March 1. They were among 57 expatriates, including NGO workers, who were flown to Kinshasa. The GOZ subsequently expelled nine of the 19 U.N. workers, after accusing the U.N.  of failing to notify the GOZ of its intention to relocate staff. News reports on March 6 told of hundreds of residents trying to flee Kisangani by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, indirect &quot;proximity&quot; talks are in recess, with representatives of the Alliance and the GOZ in consultation with their respective leaders in Zaire. The talks began on February 25, when Kabila met with President Nelson Mandela. There have been no reported meetings between Alliance and GOZ representatives. U.N. - OAU special representative Sahnoun was also in South Africa for discussions with the warring parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rwanda, ethnic violence continues. The French news service AFP, quoting U.N. and local officials, reported that 20 people died during the weekend of March 1-2. The first attack occurred in Rushashi commune, Kigali Rurale prefecture. Humanitarian workers said 10 people died and 21 were wounded. The second attack took place on March 2 or 3 in Ruhengeri prefecture, according to humanitarian workers. Although Radio Rwanda did not report the attacks, it did broadcast death noticesof the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 22, unknown gunmen in Kibungo prefecture killed 21 people, including 16 children. All were Hutu. On February 9, eight Rwandan civilians were killed and three were wounded when suspected ex-FAR/Interahamwe gunmen attacked a convoy of minibuses about 20 km from Kigali. The victims were all Tutsi, their Hutu companions having been left alone by the attackers. A report released by the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) states that human rights has &quot;drastically deteriorated&quot; since the new year.  In January, HRFOR received reports of at least 424 killings in 55 incidents, which was the highest number of killings since early 1996. In January,311 of the 424 killings occurred in the four prefectures bordering Zaire; 228 were in Ruhengeri prefecture alone. The 424 victims included 163 whose deaths were attributed to the GOR, including RPA troops, and 42 to the ex- FAR/Interahamwe. HRFOR reports that insecurity has forced it drastically to curtail its monitoring work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of foreign humanitarian workers in the past two months in Rwanda has led to the curtailment of most reliefactivities and human rights monitoring. The most recent killings of foreigners occurred on February 4, when two expatriate human rights monitors and three Rwandans working for HRFOR were shot in Karengera commune, Cyangugu prefecture. On February 2, an unidentified assailant shot and killed a Canadian Catholic priest as he was serving communion in Kampanga parish, Kinigi commune, 20 km north of Ruhengeri town. On January 18 in Ruhengeri town, about 100 km northwest of Kigali, three Spaniards were killed and an American was seriouslywounded by gunmen. The Spaniards worked for Medicos del Mundo (MDM) and the American was with Doctors of the World, an affiliate of MDM and operating through a grant funded by USAID/BHR/OFDA. The RPA stated that the killers belonged to the ex- FAR/Interahamwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 19, the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC) stated that it would base most of its 50 remainingdelegates in Kigali and maintain limited operations throughout the country, except for Ruhengeri, where ICRC has suspended its operations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has transferred 25 delegates to Kenya, leaving a staff of six in Kigali. In a press conference on February 8, Vice- President Paul Kagame described the GOR's control of the security situation as &quot;sufficient,&quot; though he added it would take time before conditions returned to normal. On February 20, Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana announced to foreign diplomats in Kigali the GOR's plan to &quot;re- educate&quot; 5, 000 ex-FAR returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political/Military Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOZ's call on March 5 for the implementation of the U.N.peaceplan for Zaire followed an announcement in Paris by Zairian Foreign Minister Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda that PresidentMobutu Sese Seko had accepted the plan.  Mobutu has beenin France since February 21. The announcement followed recent Alliance advances, which included Kindu on February 28, and Lubutu and the Tingi-Tingi camp on March 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alliance victories came after little or no fighting by the FAZ. Kindu hasa major airport and is a railhead for Shaba province. On February 26, the U.N. fired the chief administrator and deputyprosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania, after the U.N.  Inspector General reported waste and mismanagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, the ICTR has indicted 21 people, of whom 13 are in custody. Among those indicted are Anatole Nsengiyumva and Ferdinand Nahimana, who havepleaded innocent to charges that they participated in planning the 1994 genocide. Nsengiyumva, then an officer in the FAR, allegedly ordered participants at a meeting to murder Tutsis. Nahimana is the former director of Radio des Milles Collines, which urged the population to kill. In the genocide trials in Kigali, Froduald Karamira was sentenced to death on February 14 for helping to plan and undertake the genocide in 1994. He appealed the verdict. On February 18, a court in Gikongoro handed down the first acquittal of a genocide suspect on trial in Rwanda, and convicted six others to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burundi on February 24, gunmen killed seven people and wounded an infant in an attack in Kamenge, an outlying district of Bujumbura. Apparently, the killings were committed as a deterrent to Burundians who wanted to return to Kamenge, which has been largely destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts Zaire: To date there are no known large concentrations of refugeesin Eastern Zaire. The 40,000 refugees who walked fromAmisi to Tingi- Tingi on February 7 are among the 160,000 Rwandan refugees who are proceeding either to Ubundu or Kisangani. A World Food Program (WFP) plane flew over the Ubundu region on March 6, and reported seeing groups of refugees. The WFP also reported that the landing strip in Ubundu cannot accept a DC-3. Before evacuating to Kinshasa, WFP workers left one week's worth of food stocks in Kisangani and Tingi-Tingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF officials expressed great concern about the 600 children who were on therapeutic feeding and the 2,500 children who were onsupplementary feeding in the Tingi-Tingi camps before the refugees abandoned the camps last week.  News pictures of refugees walking from Tingi-Tingi to Kisangani showed them in poor condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BHR/OFDA assessment team, returning from Kinshasa on February 26, reported that the relief effort out of Kisangani had been hampered by expense, danger, and logistical difficulties. With occasional exceptions, the Tingi- Tingi refugees received less than a fifth of the 80 MT of food needed to meet their daily needs. The location of approximately 25,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees who were fleeing toward Kindu last week is also unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Kindu fell on February 28, the refugees were known to be walking from Kalima southwest toward Kindu. In Punia, 170 km south of Tingi-Tingi, the World Food Program(WFP) flew in emergency food supplies on February 25.  About 4,000 Rwandan refugees, all malnourished, arrived there two weeks ago.  TheCatholic NGO Caritas sent workers there on March 2, and the WFP flew in 9 tons of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kisangani transit center houses 2,500 IDPs, with 3,000 hoping to gain entry, the BHR/OFDA assessment team reported on February 20. Another 12,000 IDPs are dispersed throughout the city. After a request from the Alliance, the UNHCR, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), Save the Children Fund (SCF/UK), ICRC, Oxfam, and CARE sent a convoy to find refugees in Kingulube, south of Shabunda. The team, amid logistical difficulties, returned to Bukavu on February 20, transporting 40 vulnerable refugees to Rwanda. Three died en route. The relief committee will try to establish way stations to assist refugees in reachingRwanda, but poor road conditions will require all supplies to be portaged. On February 10, the ICRC reopened its office in Uvira. The ICRC is also assisting IDPs in Kalemie, to the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda: The UNHCR reports that 1,300,582 refugees returned to Rwanda in 1996, and so far this year about 232,000 refugees have returned from Zaire and Tanzania. In contrast to the 16,971 refugees who returned to Rwanda from South Kivu between January 20 to 26, only 1,675 refugees returned between January 27 and February 2, the WFP reported. The reduction is widely believed to be related to the renewed fighting in Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi: The Government of the Republic of Burundi (GRB) recently announced the establishment of regroupment camps in Bujumbura Rurale and Bururi provinces. The practice of regrouopment is already being enforced in the provinces of Karuzi, Kayanza, Cibitoke, Bubanza, and Muramvya. Local press reports state that military authorities have told Burundians living in particular areas to move to the regroupment sites. If the peasants do not move to the camps, the military will consider them rebels, and they could be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USAID/BHR/OFDA Emergency Disaster Relief Coordinator (EDRC) travelled on Highway One during February 12-13. The road links the capital to Kayanza province, which borders Rwanda. Although he saw some farmers at work, many fields appeared abandoned. He saw commercial and private traffic on the road, but fewer bicyclists transporting produce than in the past. There were signs of wanton destruction to buildings in Bugarama and Teza. In Kayanza, the EDRC visited three regroupment camps, two of them formed in January. Although the provincial governor told the EDRC that the camps were temporary, he did not say when the army would allow residents to move closer to their homes. At Buraniro camp, children appeared healthy and people were cultivating nearby fields. From February 3 to 9, the WFP distributed 1,234 MT of food to 98,173 people in Burundi. Most of the recipients have lived in regroupment camps since 1996. Kigoma port storage facilities are full; consequently, WFP truck convoys from Ngara, Tanzania, to Ngozi have risen from once to three times weekly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania: The GOT has declared that those Rwandan refugees from the Tanzanian camps who did not repatriate, and who are now hiding, will be considered illegal aliens. In early February, the UNHCR began demolishing 47, 000 huts in five camps in Karagwe, where Rwandan refugees had stayed until last December. As of February 28, there were 353,582 refugees in Tanzania, of whom 77,650 were Zairian, and 272,500 were Burundian. In the Ngara camps, there are 105,000 refugees; of the total, 59,000 are in Lukole camp, with the remainder in the former Lumasi camp, now called Lukole C. A Tanzanian newspaper reported that 220 FAZ deserters who arrived in Kigoma in late February had robbed and beaten Tanzanians. The GOT is reportedly growing increasingly impatient with this group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Kigoma region, there are 240,134 refugees: the Nduta camp has 15,614; Nyarugusu has 44,204 Zairians; Lugufu, 90 km east of Kigoma town, opened on February 15 and will have a capacity of 200,000; Muyovosi has 40,788 refugees; Mtabila has 27,319. As of February 28, there were 23,195 refugees in holding areas in Kigoma town. Ninety percent of them are Zairian. Tanzania receives about 1,000 refugees daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 26, BHR/OFDA deployed a USAID/DART to Kigali, Rwanda, to conduct assessments, report on the situation, and provide funding to NGOs, U.N.  agencies, and international organizations for programs to assist in repatriation efforts. USAID/DART completed operations on February 25. On November 7, 1996, U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda Robert Gribbin declared a disaster, noting that the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire posed a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 12, U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson declared a disaster in Zaire as a result of the violent break-up of refugee camps in eastern Zaire.On November 18, the USG pledged $140 million in humanitarian and development assistance to address needs in the Great Lakes region. On November 25, Ambassador Morris Hughes declared a disaster in Burundi as a result of continuing civil strife. From February 12 to 26, BHR/OFDA deployed an assessment team to Zaire, to evaluate relief needs in the GOZ-controlled areas of Eastern Zaire. Although insecurity prevented the team from travelling outside Kinshasa, it gathered information by meeting daily with NGOs and U.N. agencies in the capital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - This paper outlines major military, economic and political developments in the Liberian peace process and the march towards general and presidential elections in May this year. This briefing covers the period February 24 to March 4, 1997. JUSTICE AND PEACE COMMISSION National Catholic Secretariat, P. O. Box 103569 1000 Monrovia 10 Liberia, West Africa Ph. (231) 227657; 225930 Fax. (231) 227838; 226006, March 4, 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MILITARY SITUATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it was said by the West African Peace keeping Force, ECOMOG, that the disarmament process had gained a 91.8% success, there are semblances of huge cache of arms being hidden in certain parts of the country. Recently, a huge quantity of arms were discovered in the Lofa Bridge area in Lofa County.  They were hidden there by forces alleged to be of Alhadji Kromah's ULIMO-K.  Since ECOMOG dug out and retrieved said arms little over a week ago, there have been no comment from ULIMO-K.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capt. Andrew Paye, a former fighter of the defunct NPFL has alleged that the front is hiding huge quantities of arms in many parts of the country, especially in Bong and Nimba counties. Such arms, he says include assault riffles and calibres. Only the Press Secretary of former Councilman Charles Taylor, Reginald Goodridge has attempted to deny the allegation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several arms and ammunition have been discovered in the Executive Mansion by ECOMOG. Disclosure has not been made yet as to which of the former factions did store said items at the Mansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 27 fighters of ULIMO-J were rounded up by ECOMOG for being in possession of arms following the disarmament period. 17 of those rounded up were juveniles. They are currently detained at the Monrovia Central Prison in MONROVIA. All of them were severely flogged by ECOMOG, leaving deep scars and wounds on their bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Comptroller general of Liberia, Nathaniel Momo Mendemassa was on Saturday morning at 2:00 A.M. killed by armed robbers, numbering 10 at his home behind the T.B. Annex in Congo Town. He was shot twice in the thigh and abdomen. Two of the suspects have been arrested and the newly factional appointee to the Directorship of the Liberia National Police, Charles Deshield, has vowed to launch a massive and vigorous investigation into the murder of Mr. Mendemassa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITICAL SITUATION:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 28th of February set the pace for resignation of prominent government officials with an expressed commitment to contest the ensuing May 30 Presidential and General Elections. At the level of the State Council, three of the Councilmen have resigned and have nominated proxies as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Taylor -- Victoria Reffell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alhadji Kromah -- Dr. Vamba Kanneh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. George Boley -- Weade Kobbah-Wureh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other resignations include Speaker Morris Dukuly, First Deputy Speaker Samuel Dokie and Second Deputy Speaker Assumana Kroma. Others include Associate Justice Laveli Supuwood and 21 TLA members. of the various appointments made thus far, only one person Vivienne Wureh, has rejected her appointment to head the Health Ministry on grounds that she is non-factional and would not accept any factional appointment. Her rejection came on Monday in all of the dailies and the national news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusinee Kamara was on Thursday, February 27 inducted Speaker of the TLA by Ruth Perry, Chairperson of the ruling Council of State. He replaced Morris Dukuly, also of ULIMO-K.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cletus Wotorson of the Liberian Action Party (LAP) on Friday, February 28 declared his ambition for the Presidency before partisans of LAP in the presence of a record crowd and requested the support of the Alliance of Seven Political Parties to consider him the presidential preferment for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia People's Party (LPP) denies claims by the United People's Party (UPP) that both parties reached a compromise in Banjul in 1990 for the Presidency. The claim by the UPP that they had agreed in 1990 that the Interim President then should be produced by the LPP so that whenever there was any elections the UPP would correspondingly produce the President, the LPP in its Press Statement averred, is untrue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday march 3, 1997 the UPP held its primaries to elect a Standard Bearer. One of the four contestants, Joseph Boakai, was conspicuously absent, thus leaving the race to Peter Amos George, Jr., Blamoh Nelson, and the veteran G. Baccus Matthews. Of the 137 voters qualified to vote from the various electoral districts, Mr. George polled no vote, Nelson got 7 votes and Matthews 130 votes. Mr. Matthews said he is quite confident that he will emerge as the choice of the Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Two-China issue continues to (claim) public attention. Against the acceptance of the other members of the State Council, Mr. Taylor continues to maintain that there is relations between Taiwan and Liberia. He has appointed an Ambassador to Taiwan (John Cummings) and has even paid a private visit there. Upon his return, he told the nation that Taiwan has promised to assist Liberia with about U.S. $500 million for reconstruction and socio-economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the amount he has allotted $1 million for ECOM (Electoral Commission) and $1 million to his humanitarian fund. Reports coming in recently say Taiwan has denied ever promising such sum and is in fact recalling its Ambassador for misleading that country about relations between Liberia and Taiwan. Several local institutions and private individuals, including former (Council member) Alhadji Kromah, has called for the rejection of said funds (and stated that) acceptance and usage will represent an outright recognition of Taiwan and the establishment of diplomatic relations therewith. This has now become popular opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, USAID has offered to assist the ECOM with $6 million to ably conduct the elections which are slated for May 30. This offer has directly or otherwise erased the Taylor bluff about his successful mission to Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECONOMIC SITUATION:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the rate of Liberian dollars to US dollars has reduced to 56 to 1 prices of basic commodities continue to rise. Gasoline, for example costs between 85 to 90 dollars as opposed to the previous cost of 70 to 75 dollars.  A 100 pound bag of rice has now risen to 1,600.00 for pussawa (previously 1, 300.00).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, March 3, 1997 (government) announced that it is prepared to pay civil servants salary arrears up to December . There are however the usual kind of doubts because the government has always reneged on its promises of settling civil servants salary arrears over the years. These payments if effected will extend from mid 1996 to December 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OTHER ISSUES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alhaji Kromah, former Council (member) has apologized for whatever his faction and other factions have done during the period of civil crisis against the people of Liberia. He has also offered 4000 scholarships to students of the University of Liberia, where he has resumed lecturing in Mass Communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six ex-fighters of the ULIMO faction have been killed by a group of civilians using cutlasses and traditional spears in Grand Cape Mount County, reports alleged. These incidents took place in Gbeh Town, Gbieh-bor Town, Fan- mila Town, in Cape Mount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boycott of courts recently called by the Liberia National Bar Association (LNBA) still holds. The State Council has called on the LNBA to exercise restraint as the Council determines to take appropriate actions in favor of the restructuring of the Supreme Court. The Bar Association has remained stern in its decision to boycott the courts until it is allowed duly participate in or be accorded the mandate of naming judges to the Supreme Court, especially in terms of making it a defactionalized and credible arm of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the boycott on February 19, only three lawyers have appeared in courts. They include Francis Garlawolo, Arthur Williams and Frederick Jayweh.  The Supreme Court bench, as appointed by the State Council includes Hall Badio (Chief Justice); Karmoh Soko Sackor, Laveli Supuwood, Octavius Obey and William Metzgar as Associate justices. Names forwarded to the State Council include: David Kpomarkpor, Harry Reeves Cooper, Wilkins Wright, Frances Johnson Morris, David Hne, Luvenia Ash Thompson, Laveli Supuwood and C.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Sahrawi National Day (27.02.97) The population of the refugee camps commemorated the 21th anniversary of the proclamation of the SADR with great manifestations, in presence of international delegations. In his speech President Abdelaziz declared the Sahrawi people is able to defend its legitime rights and categorically refuses the occupation of its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reiterated to be ready for a serious dialog and insisted that future meetings with Morocco should concentrate on the core of the issue and should be held in a neutral country, with the presence of international observers.  The Algerian War Veterans Minister Said Abadou declared Algeria is working to help bring about a peaceful solution to the Western Sahara conflict and encourages all direct contact between the Polisario Front and Morocco, and added: &quot;Algeria's attachment and support for the legitimate claims of the Sahrawi people are firmer than ever.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech to mark the anniversary of Throne Day, King Hassan II spoke about Western Sahara:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also tried over the course of last year to inform you on the efforts to implement the UN plan to hold a referendum in our Saharan territories. These efforts might speed up the process of identification (of Saharan citizens eligible to vote) and thereby the implementation of the UN plan. Regrettably, no matter how much Morocco has tried to show its good intentions, the other side has shown only craftiness, stubbornness and procrastination, in order to delay any progress in this artificial problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Morocco, as we have repeatedly asserted, will keep its open-door policy. It is fully committed to the UN Security Council's plan and is ready to cooperate faithfully and effectively within its framework. But nothing will deter it from thwarting efforts aimed at jeopardizing its security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morocco always listens to all its sons. It is aware of their preoccupations, regardless of whether they live in the north or in the south of the country and aware of their eagerness to build their future with pride in their country - which will know, when the need arises, how to be compassionate and merciful (towards sons who have gone astray).&quot; (BBC)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">04.03.97 James Baker U.N. Envoy to Western Sahara?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kofi Annan plans to name former secretary of state James A. Baker III as his special envoy to explore possible compromises between Morocco and the Polisario Front, reveals The Washington Post, which adds that &quot;Annan believes he needs a prestigious representative to underscore the importance he attaches to this issue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">05.03.97 Mexico: no change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Mexican MP in visit at Rabat declared: &quot;The position of the Mexican government will not change&quot;. Mexico recognizes SADR since 1979, but recently rumors announced a possible retray of its recognition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Up to 14 amnesty applications from people serving sentences in Eastern Cape jails will be heard when the Amnesty Committee sits in East London next week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public hearings, to be held in the Robbie de Lange Hall, are scheduled for three days from Monday 17 March to Wednesday 19 March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicants include several members of the ANC Youth League (Ancyl) , one from Azapo and three former Ciskei policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Kwanele Enough Toba, Wakhile Thomson and Jonginkosi Wellington Makom are former Ciskei policemen who were convicted of various assaults and crimen injuria committed in 1987.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Like in many cities of sub-Sahara Africa, urban agriculture has taken root in Zimbabwe with more people, stung by harsh economic reforms, taking to cultivating crops on unused city land to supplement household food needs and income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long prohibited by the urban authorities, it was only in 1984 that local authorities allowed organized urban crop-cultivation after President Robert Mugabe directed that the public be allowed to till unused land in the cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even now those caught cultivating in the wrong places, particularly on stream banks, risk having their crops slashed, a measure that has bred controversy in many towns and cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the clearest signal yet that urban farming is now a fact of life in Zimbabwe has been the allocation of land to individuals and co-operatives in the main cities for crop cultivation by residents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While maize is grown mainly to supplement earnings, this year saw an upsurge in the cultivation of sweet potatoes, beans and other nutritious small crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This season, Harare Mayor Solomon Tawengwa sourced 6,000 tones of maize seed worth at least 3,000 U.S. dollars for free distribution to urban farmers, many of them poor folks struggling to meet daily survival needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city, the council is working on a comprehensive programme to promote urban agriculture without damaging the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town Clerk Mike Ndubiwa said part-time farming offered wide economic opportunities for the urban poor who have been hard hit by harsh economic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been signs of good organization like well demarcated fields used by specific households each year,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enda-Zimbabwe, a non-governmental organization, discovered in a recent study that the number of people engaged in urban farming doubled during the period 1990-95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the situation in Harare, even with plots which were allocated to co- operatives by the council, is somewhat haphazard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy of the city council is to let tenants plough open lands until their housing construction programmes reach the fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sofia Tom, resident of Budiriro low density suburb, cultivated her patch of sweet potatoes for the first time, in 1997..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The woman from where I stay gave me this piece of land, together with other women, saying she had grown a lot of crops in her rural home,&quot; Tom said.  &quot;Where I come from I do not have any piece of land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of sub-letting plots in urban areas is not a new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandivamba Rukuni, the chairman of the 1994 Land Tenure Commission, said similar reports had been received when his team was collecting evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were told that one person would own large tracts of land in an urban area which he would sublet to other tenants,&quot; he said. &quot;On giving up that piece of land, its ownership would revert back to the original landlord who would relocate it to somebody else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears that urban agriculture could result in environmental degradation have been allayed by Chris Mugadza of the Natural Resources Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urging councils to formalize cultivation in urban areas, he said Zimbabwean law required farmers to cultivate at least 30 meters away from streams and only on suitable soils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If councils can identify areas that can be cultivated, people can pay for that. Then Agritex (the Department of Agricultural Technical and Extension Services) can come in and advice on conservation,&quot; Mugadza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rukuni said in many industrializing countries, and where their urban populations were growing, developed a sound policy of part-time farming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you have a tradition of small-scale production like most Zimbabweans have, it means that for those people it makes economic sense to have land in small parts and utilize it, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There should be a method to lease land. There is need for clarity in managing that land so the municipality will regulate it to conserve water and soil,&quot;he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rukuni said for any form of agriculture to succeed the government should come up with a general land policy, which is lacking in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - What would you do, if penniless, but happen to bump into a bag stuffed with as much as 60,000 U.S. dollars lying in the middle of the road with nobody watching: walk home quietly to attend to your numerous financial needs or report the find to the police?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Nigerian commercial driver, Malam Abdulkarim Shehu, shunned the temptation of such questionable instant wealth and chose the latter option: the path of honor, which has brought him national recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 23, Shehu, riding in a French designed Peugeot car, was on his way from Jibia, a border town between Nigeria and Niger. He was heading for Kano, Nigeria's northern city, when he spotted an object on the busy road frequented by traders, who transported merchandise between Nigeria and other West African countries such as Burkina Faso, Guinea, Niger and Sierra Leone. &quot; When I saw the bag in the night, I thought an innocent victim of a motor accident was waiting for help and so I stopped,&quot; he said in a newspaper interview published in Sunday in the southern city of Lagos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on getting to the spot, he said he discovered it was a big bag containing bundles of money. This was later confirmed by police in Kano State to be 30.05 million francs CFA, about 60,000 U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shehu said he took the money home but remained in such shock he was unable to sleep that night. The following day, he took the bag of money to officials of the local branch of the Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers who took the money to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it turned out, the money belonged to a group of 30 traders from Burkina Faso, who were on a business trip to Kano. The bag had dropped without their knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his honesty Shehu, 34, has appeared on Nigeria's television network programme to receive words of commendation from the Kano deputy commissioner of police, Ade Ajakaiye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a gallant display of patriotism by an honest Nigerian at a time when economic hardship is pushing people to commit crimes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Ajakaiye handed the money to the Burkinabe nationals, who he would not identified by name, for what the police said were security reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To show their own appreciation, the traders gave Shehu 30,000 franc, about 60 dollars, in cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, popular opinion is that Shehu deserves more, especially from the Nigerian authorities, if only to encourage similar show of public spirit by the citizenry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver's financial standing also appears pathetic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shehu, a father of two children, said one of his two wives had divorced him, apparently over a financial dispute, and his other wife was expecting a new baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not have money to buy firewood for her, let alone food,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite his precarious state, Shehu, a devout muslim, says he derives joy from his action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had taken the money I would spend it and my Allah will ask me on the final day,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still sounding philosophical, he said &quot;no amount of money taken illegally would make one rich unless Allah wishes you so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shehu's friend, Garba Faggi, has also attested to his honesty, but insists that &quot;many people would not return the money if faced with similar challenges.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an incentive to others, Faggi recommended that Shehu be rewarded adequately by the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another commentator suggested the driver be considered for assistance under Nigeria's National Family Support Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Nigerian police corporal, who turned in one million naira (about 12,000 dollars) he found at an accident scene two years ago was promoted and received car gifts and scholarships for his children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conceding that Shehu needs more than a symbolic national recognition, Ajakaiye said bigger rewards could be in the offing for the driver for his exemplary demonstration of public spirit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when and in what form this would come, he could not say.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - At attempted jailbreak by inmates of the Addis Ababa Central Prison was foiled Monday when guards fired shots before capturing three prisoners in the compound of the Organization of African Unity headquarters, the O.A.U.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said a number of the prisoners jumped the walled prison fence and dashed across a wide open space before reaching and scaling the O.A.U.  perimeter wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said the shooting lasted about five minutes as guards ran after the prisoners in hot pursuit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said they were unsure if the guards fired their guns after the prisoners entered the compound, which is a diplomatic premiss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witnesses said that one of three captured escapees was slightly wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police cordoned off roads close by and leading directly to the O.A.U., after the shooting about 15.30 p.m. (12.30 gmt), as several prisoners made their dash for freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not immediately clear how many prisoners escaped and were recaptured.  It is also unclear whether or not they were common criminals. However, police and prison officials are expected to issue a statement on the incident later Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of the O.A.U. were not immediately available for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Students at the Lusaka campus of the University of Zambia boycotted classes Monday, in protest against the non-payment of their book allowances by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of riot police kept vigil outside the campus early Monday after students hurled stones at vehicles along the Great East Road in the capital, Lusaka. Police have blocked the main entrance to the campus and arrested eight students.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students are demanding the payment of some 280 U.S. dollars as book allowance for returning students and about 150 dollars for freshmen, promised by government in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students claim the government has failed to provide a convincing explanation for the delayed payments since the institution opened February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The university's public relations officer, Mulise Malambo, said an official statement would be issued later. The official would not comment further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Zambian Minister of Education, Syamukayumbu Syamujaye, told journalists that police would deal expeditiously with the arrested students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian News Agency reported that nine student had been expelled with immediate effect. One other has been suspended for one academic year for riotious behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency said that the university authorities had ordered students to report for classes Tuesday or face disciplinary action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire student body is to a punitive levy for wilful damage to university property. No student will be allowed to register for the second semester until the levy is paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University students at the northern copperbelt town of Kitwe are also demanding immediate payment of their meal and book allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian media reported that students had not been paid allowances since they opened two weeks ago and most of them were very hungry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Copperbelt University Students' Union acting president, Harry Mafuta, said tension was mounting among students over the delayed payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Normally, we are paid four days after opening but this has now been two weeks and we have not received a proper reason for the delay,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudan said Monday it reserved &quot;the right to respond&quot; to the reported aggression by Ugandan troops on the border towns of Kaya and Bazi, southwest of Juba, the capital of Sudan's Equatoria region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official Sudan News Agency quoted government spokesman Tayeb Ibrahim Mohamed Khair as saying that a &quot;large number of tanks and heavy artillery were used by the aggressors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khair, who is also information and culture minister, said that Khartoum might respond to this &quot;heinous aggression by all means available.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He alleged the attack was in fulfillment of threats by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni who was quoted a few weeks ago as saying he was looking for a way to settle differences with the Sudan in the battlefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack on Kaya and Bazi, located a few hundred meters from the Uganda border, was first announced by the Sudanese army spokesman, Gen. Mohamed Sanousi Ahmed. He said the attack occurred at 5.00 A.M. Sunday (0200 GMT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a terse military communique, Ahmed had said that the attack was launched by &quot; Ugandan forces moving from the Ugandan Koboko and Kiro areas.&quot; on the town of Kaya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the assault on Bazi was launched from Zairian border areas of Aliwara and Ambakalo. He said both areas were under what he termed the control of Uganda-backed Tutsi anti-government forces in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ahmed did not give any casualties but said Sudanese troops were &quot; courageously fighting the aggressors on all the battle fronts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that &quot;inlets were opened (by the Ugandan attackers) for the rebels to move towards the town of Yei&quot; in Equatoria state, southwestern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About two months ago, Sudan accused Ethiopia of opening similar corridors for rebels to seize border towns in the Blue Nile region. Addis Ababa denied the allegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed also claimed Monday that Israeli, Eritrean and Ethiopian military experts had joined Uganda in the attacks Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are sure about the involvement of 30 Israeli experts in the Ugandan attacks on the border localities of Bazi and Kaya,&quot; he said at a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been no independent confirmation of the latest Sudanese claim against these three countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admed declined to confirm claims by the Sudanese opposition fighting the government that that the two localities had fallen to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fierce fighting is still going on. Our defence is not an inflexible one,&quot; Ahmed said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Statistics of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) show that Africa loses about 850 million U.S.  dollars annually due to poor collection of animal hides and skins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African livestock owners also hardly receive added value for &quot;a good quality skin from any animal sold alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spore, a publication on information for agricultural development in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific countries, which highlights the FAO's views, says that skins are not collected for markets in sub-Sahara Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, it says Guinea collects only 20 percent of its skins for markets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nigeria, Africa's most populous country with some 100 million people, the problem is different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most hides and skin produced in the country are cooked and consumed as a local delicacy nicknamed &quot;Ponmo,&quot; in southwestern Nigeria, where it is mostly eaten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ponmo is extracted from at least 1.3 million cows slaughtered annually in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Nigeria accounts for some 70 percent of these animals, imports from neighbouring Niger and Mali make up the shortfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No particular attention was paid to these statistics in the Nigeria's heady days of abundant petro-dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But given the current economic depression, beef, a body-building protein, has been priced beyond the reach of the average Nigerian family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A kilogram of beef is now sells for 180 naira (2.25 U.S. dollars), while ponmo of the same weight goes for less than 60 naira (75 U.S. cents). All this in a country where the minimum wage is under 2,000 naira (25 dollars) a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Nigerian families now try to cut corners. And even against the warning from health experts that ponmo has no nutritional value, consumers have stuck adamantly to the product, which is even far cheaper than fish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While its origin remains a mystery, the consumption of ponmo has gained popularity as appetite for it has spread to the rest of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ponmo does not require much work. It is prepared, first, by removing the hairs on the cow hide by shaving or burning. Then, the skin is soaked in water for about 24 hours. It is par-boiled with potash and is ready for the soup pot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade in ponmo is popular among women, with civil servants and middle income earners, constituting the largest clientele.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Nigerian government is worried that the high rate of ponmo consumption poses a great threat to the country's otherwise lucrative leather industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, officials launched a campaign in 1996 to dissuade consumption of ponmo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the national drive, Science and Technology Minister Sam Momah has said the practice of cooking hides and skin should be outlawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the country is losing about one billion U.S. dollars annually in potential foreign exchange earnings from the local consumption of hides and skin that could have been transformed into exportable leather and its products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Momah says Nigeria could gain more by exporting its processed hides and that &quot;only a controlling legislation can save the situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary to the Nigerian government, Gidado Idris, has also joined in the crusade warning that the country could not afford to kill its leather industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But from all indications, the campaign has achieved very little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their reaction to appeals and threats from government officials on ponmo consumption, consumers interviewed on Nigerian national television threatened recently to start a &quot;ponmo riot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said instead of quarrelling over consumption of ponmo, government should do something to improve the living conditions of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, the provost of the Federal College of Chemical and Leather Technology, Zaria in northern Nigeria, Benedict Dashe, says persuasion rather then threat should be the solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illustrating with statistics the danger posed to the leather industry by indiscriminate ponmo consumption, Dashe says tanneries in Lagos, where the bulk of the cows in the country are slaughtered, depend on other parts of the country for the supply of hides and skin. Those in Lagos are consumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1960s and 1970s, he says, some 90 percent of hides in Britain were supplied by Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still on the economic implications of local consumption of hides and skin, Dashe says, &quot;a pair of imported shoes for which Nigerians pay about 7,000 naira (87.5 dollars) now, could have been produced locally for less than half that price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to stem the controversy, he says &quot;there should be adequate public enlightenment on the wastage which should appeal to the patriotic instinct of us all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, ponmo sellers are worried a ban on the item would affect their livelihood, adversely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One ponmo seller, Olufunke Daisi, says she makes between 150 and 300 naira (1.88 and 3.75 dollars) a day selling ponmo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says a ban would throw her and an estimated 1,000 ponmo traders in various Lagos markets, out of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the national debate rages, ponmo addicts continue to munch the zero-nutrient &quot;delicacy&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Libya earned at least nine billion U.S. dollars in 1996, the country's Central Bank Governor, Taher Jehmi, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report to the People's General Congress, the country's highest legislative body which ended a six-day session Sunday in Syrte, he said that 95 percent of the earnings were from petroleum sales.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces 1.2 million barrels of oil a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Jehmi said that the fall in crude oil prices on the world market, toward the second half of the 1980s, prompted Libya to suspend several industrial and agricultural development projects.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France wants the men tried for their alleged involvement in downing a French jetliner, belonging to the private company, UTA. That plane crashed into Niger's Tenere desert in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Libya's repeated refusal to send the suspects for trial in Britain or the United States, the U.N. tighten sanctions by freezing Libya's foreign assets and putting an embargo on equipment for its oil industry, the mainstay of the country's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the recent O.A.U. Ministerial Council meeting in Tripoli, Libyan Foreign Affairs Minister Omar Montassir told the Pan African News Agency that sanctions had led to an increase in the cost of oil production and that operations could stop at any moment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHANNON, Ireland (PANA) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's VIP charter flight from Ireland had to be aborted Monday soon after take off from Shannon Airport, about 200 kilometres west of Dublin, after one of the engines developed a fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reconditioned Boeing 707, which is more than 30 year old, had stopped in Shannon for refuelling after a 20-minute flight from Dublin, and took about 75 minutes to land as it had to jettison fuel for safe landing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even after releasing the fuel, the plane could not land immediately because its nose wheel would not lower automatically. It had to be released manually.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe, accompanied by his wife Grace, Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge and other government officials and reporters, had completed a two-day official visit to Ireland and was returning home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First there was the smell of fuel on take off, followed by sparks of fire from one of the four engines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Capt. Christopher Szechenyi announced over the public address system that engine number three had developed a problem, the fire indicator was on, and the aircraft had to return to Shannon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most passengers in the economy class put on a brave face as the captain reassured them, the mood changed when he said the nose wheel could not be released, especially after explaining that the aircraft was taking time to land &quot;as we are trying to burn as much fuel as we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Szechenyi said, &quot;We have a problem, the nose wheel will not come down. We are now in a situation where we have to put down the nose wheel manually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this time all the passengers had their seat belts tightly fastened as one of the cabin crew had elaborately read out the emergency evacuation instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The green safety instruction sheets, which most passengers usually ignore, suddenly became prime reading material as everyone prepared for the worst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief of Protocol, Munyaradzi Kajese, who at a point appeared a bit restless, tried to cheer up passengers by dancing funnily along the aisle but quite a number of passengers were still trying to absorb the safety instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we are gone,&quot; quipped one journalist, feigning a smile while another government official immediately behind him also, pretending to be unperturbed chipped in: &quot;When your day has come there is no running away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the plane landed, at an unusually high speed, trailed well over 20 fire engines, police car and ambulances that had been summoned by the airport authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president and his delegations were later taken to hotels in the small Irish town, to await alternative arrangements for their flight home.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DUBLIN (PANA) - Africa is poised to become the world's new region of opportunity and the continent's major priority is to create durable democratic systems in which pluralism is fully entrenched, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing academics, politicians, journalists and leading personalities at a colloquium organized by Harvard University and the Irish Times newspaper, Mugabe said despite negative international media reports, Africa was taking measures to create peace, stability and economic prosperity on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's Recognition of its Past and Remedies for Its Future was the focus of Mugabe's lengthy address which traced Africa's history and present realities of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa has been dubbed the dark continent in spite of the fact that there is probably more light and sunshine on the African continent than on any other landmass on this planet,&quot; he said. &quot;Africa is much more than a story of tragedies.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While conceding that post-independent African leaders had made mistakes, it was folly to blame Africa's backwardness on bad government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Africa is indeed pulling out of the dark age, an age of unreason, cruelty and irrationality. But it is a dark age into which it was plunged by others, not by itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We go into history to learn and not necessarily to apportion blame. A proper appreciation of what happened will instruct our steps today and so help us avoid the pitfalls of the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said Africa was now determined to resolve conflicts afflicting the continent, most of which he blamed on colonialism and the cold war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under colonialism, he said, ethnic African groups were kept apart and made liable to be suspicions of each other. During the cold war, leaders of independent African countries were either rewarded or punished by the two super-powers for their ideological preferences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shift was costly for Africa because its most principled leaders, those who sought to retain the people as their constituency in defiance of outside powers, became the targets of deliberate destabilization policies, while those who collaborated as pliant clients often became blatantly corrupt dictators, now dependent on the might of their foreign masters to remain in power,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given what African leaders had to contend with, that the continent has held up the way it has, is itself a source of both wonder and satisfaction,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Africa took measures to ensure peace and stability through the Organization of African Unity and regional organizations, he said, the environment for investment and economic development would improve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the lack of major industries in most countries as being the major obstacle to development and the main reason for Africa's rising indebtedness.  He added that international terms of trade, despite the successful Uruguay Round negotiations which led to the establishment of the Wold Trade Organization, remained biased against Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said by stressing the opening up of all markets while seeking to protect information and knowledge, particularly intellectual property rights and technology, the WTO exposed Africa to exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just as I believe inequality and unfairness can engender political instability at the domestic level, so do we view inequality and unfairness at the international level as making for instability and injustice in international relations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was for that reason Africa was pushing for the democratization of the United Nations by including African and Latin American countries in the Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said Africa, with a few exceptions, had embraced democracy and that the genius of its people was once again being unleashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of its governments are becoming more and more accountable to the people. It can already see an era of peace in the horizon and with it the flourishing human spirit,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African people, he said, had &quot;resolved never again to remain the object of history but to transform themselves into its subject.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Africa sought more socio-economic ties, he said, it was also looking at other developing countries in such regions as Asia and South America in the spirit of South-South cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans, he said, would determine the destiny of their continent and cooperate with others as equal partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were their own political liberators, they are sure to become their own economic liberators,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - The Japanese government announced on February 22 it had donated US$266,00 to the Malawi government for victims of floods in the Shire valley, south Malawi. The donation will be channeled through the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some US$100,000 of the donation is in cash while the rest will be given in blankets, food, clothing and tents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOCTORS PROPOSE WARD CLOSURES AT BLANTYRE HOSPITAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical staff at the Queen Elizabeth referral hospital in Blantyre have said, that unless the administration at the hospital is able to get more staff for fee paying wards, the best solution would be to close them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of Department of Medicine at the College of Medicine, Professor John Murray, said Wards 2A and 2B face a critical shortage of staff. Professor Murray said that the staffing situation was so bad that this was resulting in inadequate patient care and if it did not improve the wards would have to close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QECH is a teaching hospital for the Malawi College of Medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTION FOR AUGUST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has announced that the long-awaited local government elections will be held in August this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Government and Rula Development Minister Dr Matembo Nzunda said he had been assured by the Electoral Commission that the long overdue elections will take place this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Affairs Committee had accused government of delaying the elections for political interests. They had called on NGOs to pressure government saying the failure to hold elections two years ago had contributed to the stagnation of democratic structures in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government had countered saying the main hindrance had been finding the K350 million (US$23.34 million) needed to hold the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIGH COURT BAN ON NEWSPAPERS&lt;/bold&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High Court in Blantyre has banned Blantyre Newspapers, Daily Times and Malawi News, and their printers, Blantyre Print and Packaging Limited, from publishing and printing any stories mentioning Information, Broadcasting, Posts and Telecom's Minister, Brown Mpinganjira in connection with the Employment Bureau of Africa (Teba).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpinganjira had last year sued owners of the two papers for defamation.  This followed the publishing of statements by opposition MCP Vice President Gwanda Chakuamba alleging that he had misappropriated Teba funds from the South African government to the government of Malawi. The funds were meant to be paid to former mine workers. The minister also applied to the High Court to order the newspapers to stop publishing the stories until the matter was resolved in open court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his ruling, Justice William Hanjahanja said that since an audit report alleging the Teba money had been misappropriated mentioned the involvement of many other public figures and government departments in the misuse of the money, it was unfair to single out only one individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanjahanja also said the copy of the report, presented in court together with the affidavit from the lawyer representing BP&amp;P, was not an original one.  It was a photocopy and there were no signatures, raising serious doubts about its authenticity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NO LIGHT ON SAGA OF DEPORTED ZAMBIANS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There would appear to be no light spread as yet on the saga of two Zambians deported to Malawi in August 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Chinula and William Banda were deported to Malawi by order of the Zambian government. The Zambian government said the two men were Malawians who had been embroiled in Zambian politics. However, the High Court in Malawi ruled March 13, 1995, that the two were Zambians, were wrongfully deported to Malawi and were free to return to Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if the two men were welcome in Zambia following the High Court's ruling, Zambia High Commissioner to Malawi, Colonel Lawrence Haamaundu said his government had not even been advised by Malawi that Chinula and Banda were free to return to Zambia. He said if the Malawi government had ruled them to be Zambians, it should have given them 90 days to prepare for their return to Zambia. He said the fact that they had managed to stay in Malawi for such a long time meant to him that they were where they belong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation tried but failed to make an appointment with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba to discuss the issue when he paid a four-day visit to Malawi recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinula and Banda who left their families and property in Zambia say they are suffering in Malawi because they have no proper means of earning a living.  They said that they now depend on well-wishers and relatives for their survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MALAWI-MOZAMBIQUE LAKE TRANSPORT ON THE CARDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi wants to introduce lake services on Lake Malawi between its ports and those on the Mozambican side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If an agreement is signed between Malawi Lake Services Limited and its Mozambican counterpart, vessels owned by the two companies will be able to call at the other country's ports on a reciprocal basis. MLS Director, Austin Msowoya, said the move to introduce the service was first mooted by the Malawi government about three years ago when Malawi signed a similar agreement with Tanzania Lake Service Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same idea was suggested to the Mozambican government and their Minister of Transport expressed interest. Mozambique has, however, not provided feedback as to its latest position on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Msowoya said Mozambique does not presently have a single ship on the lake so, should the deal be signed, it will initially be to Malawi's advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOY INJURED BY GRENADE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An eight year old boy from Makheta, a poor neighbourhood in Blantyre, escaped death on March 5 when a hand grenade he was playing with exploded in his hands, severely injuring him. Lamison Gama, who was later admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital is being treated for multiple injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives said the boy had found the grenade and was playing with it with friends. They said the grenade exploded when he pulled the safety pin.  Fortunately for the others, they were some distance from Gama when the accident took place and were not injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not known from where the grenade came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MALAWI BEATS BOTSWANA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi national soccer team has beaten Botswana 4-1 in their Africa Cup Group Seven encounter in Gaborone. With this win, Malawi now has 6 points, one point behind Zambia who are leading in the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Malawi and Zambia have three games on hand. Malawi has one away game against Zambia while the other two will be played in Blantyre. Zambia was recently held to a barren draw with unfancied Mauritius in the latter's backyard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - The story of Joseni Alufazema, 56, and his family of seven seemed like a fairy tale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last growing season was among the best for the Alufazemas. They realised a bumper harvest from almost all their cash and food crops. &quot;Cotton was the most rewarding, followed by sorghum, then rice. From all my farming activities, I managed to raise in excess of K50 000 (US$3,340),&quot; said Alufazema. Spurred on by last year's successes, he re-invested about K30 000 into his farming business in the hope that this year, he would get even more.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, each passing day is less of a fairy tale and more of a nightmare as he now agonises over how he is going to fend for his family up to the next harvest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alufazemas have lost all their cotton, sorghum and rice fields following heavy flooding that occurred in their area. &quot;What is more painful is that the floods have also left us homeless after damaging our two beautiful houses and all our property,&quot; he lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alufazemas are among the 80,000 people who have been rendered destitute due to heavy flooding following the incessant rains in February. This affected the Shire valley area in Nsanje and Chikwawa districts, south Malawi.  In addition to the 80,000, the floods have also affected some 20,000 Mozambicans who crossed over into Malawi in search of immediate assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the government moved in with tents, the victims were crammed in classrooms and church buildings in upland areas that had survived the floods.  The Ministry of Health has reported a serious diarrhoea outbreak in the two districts due to the lack of sanitation. The victims' immediate needs are food, drinking water, shelter and health facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner for Disaster and Relief, Lucius Chikuni, told a delegation of the United Nations System in Malawi that the government needs K199 million (US$14 million) to cater for the flood victims. President Bakili Muluzi, who visited the area soon after the flooding took place, has since declared the two districts disaster areas. Also, in the wake of the flooding, the government has appealed to the donor community and other well-wishers for urgent assistance. Several donor organisations and countries, as well as local well-wishers, have already started responding to this call for assistance. Government and non-governmental organisations have been airlifting food and other relief items to the victims by helicopter from Blantyre, some 80 to 100 kilometres away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Systems in Malawi, however, has demanded that the government should furnish them with exact statistics, as to the victims and their requirements, as a condition for their assistance. Chikuni insisted that their working figure was 80,000 people, adding that there was a possibility that more people could become affected by the floods since the rainy season was not over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For what they consider would be a permanent solution to the problem, government has announced that it would be setting aside land upstream for people willing to settle in less flood-prone areas. The government says flooding along the Shire River had become a perennial phenomenon and the best solution was to look elsewhere for land for the victims. Minister of Lands and Evaluation, Peter Fachi, said the government had decided to resettle the victims upstream where they would not be affected by the periodic flooding.  He said, however, that the resettlement exercise would be voluntary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While welcoming the suggestion, the majority of the people have said they would not leave their ancestral lands. Estere Ofesi, 44, who said she owns two hectares of fertile land along the Shire River, has vowed never to abandon the land where her mother and father are buried. &quot;When I die, I want to be buried next to my mother,&quot; she said. Most of the people cite economic reasons. They say the river, which is the outlet from Lake Malawi and Malawi's largest and longest river, was their source of income from the fish it provides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fostino, Estere's husband, speaking for many said, &quot;Our life has been good here, along the Shire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;bold&gt;1. FROZEN BANDA BANK ACCOUNTS CONDEMNED BY MCP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Malawi Congress Party has condemned the government's move of 21 February to freeze the foreign bank accounts of former president Kamuzu Banda Cecilia and Mary Kadzamira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement released February 21 by the MCP said the move &quot;gives the impression these accounts were opened with stolen money &quot;. The statement said Dr Banda had never made a secret of his UK bank accounts that included accounts for all his closest relatives, including the late Nelson Mwale, Mrs Kumangirana and Ms Chendawaka Mwale. All were opened in the 70s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NELSPRUIT - The Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF) and rural communities from the Blyde River Canyon in Mpumalanga who are directly affected by the province's controversial Dolphin Deal sent delegates to Parliament on Tuesday to brief the Standing Select Committee on Environmental Affairs about their concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EJNF earlier this week rejected a list of amendments to the secret R12,2- billion deal with the Dubai-based Dolphin Group, saying that the government had still not &quot;bothered&quot; consulting with affected communities and appeared to be intentionally sidelining them instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dolphin deal, which was sighed by the Mpumalanga Parks Board (MPB) and Dolphin without any public consultation last year November, gives Dolphin exclusive commercial development and transverse rights to six State-owned game reserves, Blyde River Canyon and Loskop Dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rural communities living in the target areas protested vigorously to the deal, pointing out that they had gazetted land claims on at least three of the core development areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Land claims are only gazetted by the Land Commissioner if they are found to be justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return for its 25-year monopoly on all of Mpumalanga's key tourism attractions, Dolphin last week offered to pay MPB 25 percent of its revenue from operations in the various parks, as well as an additional 7 percent of its turnover to assist the MPB with its projected budget deficit over the 25- year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga's legislature originally approved deal's such as the Dolphin one with the sole aim of finding private sector funders to pay both MPB's deficit and its normal running budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government says that it was forced to do this because it simply didn't have the money to fund the MP.SOURCE&amp;DATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPB asked for R54-million for salaries and other personnel expenses for 1997/ 98, while the province can only afford to give it R11-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislative members also expressed concern this week that the 7 percent offer by Dolphin was not &quot;good enough&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of community outrage, Dolphin also proposed reserving at least 20 percent equity ownership in various joint venture companies which will run the reserve's commercial operations for surrounding communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is hailing the new concessions as a victory for Mpumalanga, but again no-one has bothered to actually ask the people living in these areas what they want,&quot; explained EJNF provincial co-ordinator, Thabo Mabihlaba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sure, it's a lot of money for the government and the MPB, but this is 25- years of various community's lives which have just been signed away without once consulting with those affected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting that the amendments, including the scrapping of a 50-year secrecy clause in the agreement, were purely symbolic, Mabihlaba said on Tuesday that Mpumalanga's environmental affairs MEC, David Mkhwanazi, was still refusing to meet with either the EJNF or with community delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to express our deepest disappointment at the way the MEC and MPB have handled this issue. We've written to both on a number of occasions, but they've chosen to ignore us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that communities were &quot;feeling more and more sidelined and marginalised by the very people they voted in to listen to their concerns,&quot; Mabihlaba said that their only option now appeared to be to appeal directly to the relevant national leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Regardless of the terms or benefits of any contract, any agreement which is not first negotiated with affected communities is seriously undermining the aspirations of communities to get full control of their land and their future,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's not see a repeat of the Apartheid era where the State took the freedom of choice away from 'ignorant rurals' and unilaterally decided what was in their 'best interests'.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EMPANGENI - The Azanian Student's Congress (Azasco) in KwaZulu/ Natal lashed out at the South African Student's Congress (Sasco) on Monday afternoon for allegedly misleading students on the campus of the University of Zululand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charging that Sasco had blatantly lied to students about registration requirements and about its campaign to have unregistered students formally registered by the University, Azasco said at a mass meeting on Monday that Sasco was &quot;callously&quot; using student's fears to further its own political objectives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasco organised boycotts and protest marches at the university last week in protest against the university's decision not to allow more than 800 unregistered students back into classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These selfish boycotts which were simply a point scoring exercise have done nothing but bring the university into disrepute. And they have also made the authorities less inclined to listen to us next time there is a genuine problem,&quot; said Azasco campus leader and Student Representation Council president, Mbongiseni Ndlela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they had really been concerned about the unregistered students, they would have instead had constructive negotiations with management.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasco spokesperson, Vusi Mahaye, denied that Sasco had attempted to play on student's fears and insisted on Tuesday that demands for the unconditional registration of all unregistered students was &quot;a genuine clause worth fighting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why should economic and past educational problems stand in the way of those who want education from getting it,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Azasco controlled SRC meanwhile announced a further two week extension for registration at the university.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABIE - The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) sent six special force trackers to Sabie on Tuesday morning to assist with the search for two missing people who were swept off a bridge near Sabie on Monday by a flash flood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police helicopters, divers and sniffer dogs are already on the scene but have been hampered in their search by muddy waters and strong currents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial police spokesman Sergeant Thabisile Gama told African Eye News Service that earlier reports indicating that five people were missing were incorrect.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only three people were in the bakkie that was swept off a bridge. A 13- year-old boy managed to swim to shore, but his mother and the vehicle's driver are still missing and we are beginning to lose hope of finding them alive,&quot; explained Gama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both George Sekatane (54) and Paulinah Kwiane (32) could not swim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survivor, Collen Khwiane, spoke from his Sabie Hospital bed about his ordeal for the first time on Tuesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mother was taking me to this very hospital for eye tests on Monday when we were offered a lift in the bakkie. We jumped at the offer but when the bakkie tried to cross the swollen river, we got stuck half-way across,&quot; explained the still tearful Collen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr Sekatane tried revving his way over the bridge but the wheels just turned and we did not move. The water was rising and then he tried to reverse.  The next thing I knew, the bakkie was upside down in the water and was sinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collen says that he managed to push himself free from the vehicle, but was unable to see what happened to either his mother or Sekatane because of the muddy water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw a branch near me when I surfaced and managed to swim to it. After crawling to shore, I screamed for my mother but she was no-where to be seen.  I then ran home and reported the accident,&quot; added Collen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police searchers have combed the banks of the Blyde River from the scene of the accident to the Sybrandt van Niekerk Dam but have found no trace of either missing person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The army trackers are our last real hope at the moment, so lets just wish for the best,&quot; added Sergeant Gama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NELSPRUIT - Fifty farm labourers and their families were forced to sleep in ditches next to the N4 highway outside Nelspruit on Monday night, after police evicted them from the Cairn Trust Farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The angry labourers, who walked into town and protested outside Premier Mathews Phosa's offices on Tuesday, said that police had smashed their doors down when residents refused to open for them and had &quot;violently&quot; thrown their furniture onto the back of police trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just told us that the farmer no longer wanted us on his land. Then they took our furniture and dumped it next to the highway, damaging stuff that is precious to us poor people but which obviously means nothing to them,&quot; said community spokesperson, Wilburforce Dotyeni.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the furniture was taken away but we still refused to move, the police told us that unless we ran off the farm very quickly, there would be more trouble than what we could handle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting that the only reason farmer Mike Perera had evicted them was because all the farm labourers had recently joined a farm labour union, Dotyeni said that many of the labourers had lived and worked on Cairn Trust for 30 to 40-years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, overnight, we are without homes or any means to protect our wives and children,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perera was unavailable for comment on Tuesday but the Department of Land Affairs in Nelspruit confirmed that it was aware of the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are aware of the situation, but cannot unfortunately get directly involved because these people are not labour tenants and are therefore not protected by the Labour Tenant Act,&quot; explained Lowveld departmental deputy- director, David Mabunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only labourers who are given shelter and land to farm on are protected by the Act, while those that receive normal salaries are not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the information at our disposal, this thing started as a labour relations dispute. Apparently the farmer became very upset that his labourers insisted on voting in the historic 1994 democratic elections and threatened to fire them&quot; adds Mabunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They joined a union to protect themselves and have been in dispute since then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that Land Affairs doesn't condone any eviction for any reason and that the department always attempts to facilitate negotiations, Mabunda also said on Tuesday that the labourers in this instance had &quot;difficult&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This eviction could have been avoided if the workers had been a little more co-operative. Instead they made demands they knew the farmer would not accept. But it also appears that the police were heavy-handed during the eviction,&quot; Mabunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of Strategic Planning in the Premier's Office, Joe Magagula told the angry labourers on Tuesday that the government could do nothing immediately for them and that they should report the matter to the Nelspruit Police Station.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NELSPRUIT - The financial director of the Mozambican company, Brithol Michoma, died of serious head injuries in Mpumalanga on Saturday, after two provincial hospitals allegedly refused to admit her because &quot;she was a foreigner with a medical aid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police confirmed on Tuesday that Anna-Maria Mendez (29) and two companions were seriously injured in a head-on collision while on their way to Johannesburg from Maputo on Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the companions, Christo Todorob (26), died immediately after their vehicle collided with a heavily loaded truck just outside of Malelane. The truck was also a Mozambican registered vehicle which was returning to Maputo from Johannesburg.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendez, who sustained severe injuries to her head, and Rui Alegri were rushed to the nearby Shongwe Hospital, which reportedly refused to treat them and instead referred the two to the Themba Hospital in Kabokweni township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, after arriving at Themba, medical staff allegedly discovered that the two Mozambicans had medical aid and referred them to the Rob Ferreira Hospital 50km away in Nelspruit for &quot;better treatment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say that doctors at Rob Ferreira then decided the injuries would be better treated at Nelspruit's Private Hospital, &quot;especially since they had medical aid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendez and Alegri were finally admitted to the Private Hospital at 05h00 on Saturday morning - ten hours after the accident on Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendez died of her injuries shortly after being admitted after doctors were unable to stabilise her condition. Alegri is still in the hospital's intensive care unit and is reported to be critical but stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shongwe Hospital spokesperson, Obert Ntimane, confirmed on Tuesday that Mendez and Alegri had been turned away because staff had thought that 'they will get better help' at Themba. Ntimane refused to say whether either patient had received any medication from hospital staff before being transferred to Themba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two patients were unknown and unconscious - in coma - when they arrived here. We have no specialists and so we decided it would be best to send them to Themba,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alegri's doctor, Dr Eric Der Wael, said on Tuesday that both Mendez and Alegri should have been sent directly to Nelspruit's Private Hospital for immediate treatment. &quot;The transfers were badly handled. With more time, we could perhaps have been able to do something for Mendez. The Private Hospital is the only medical institute in this part of Mpumalanga with a Computerised Tomogramme Machine which we need to revive the patient's brain,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But unfortunately there just wasn't anything we could do at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendez's family arrived in Nelspruit on Tuesday, while Alegri's family have been keeping a vigil beside their father's bed since Sunday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LYDENBURG - Fourteen taxi drivers were refused bail by the Lydenburg Magistrate's Court in Mpumalanga on Tuesday after allegedly kidnapping four members of a competing taxi organisation and executing them in a cave near Burgersfort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the State, the 14 South African Long Distance Taxi Association (Saldta) drivers kidnapped Titus Molepo, Silas Nkoeng, Paul Letsoalo and Michael Mathenya from the Jane Furse Taxi Rank after a meeting set up to resolve disputes about routes broke down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police report that representatives from Saldta and the independent Boseka- bo-eja Taxi Association (BTA) began arguing violently after Saldta attempted to force BTA to merge with it. Members from both side allegedly drew pistols and began shooting at each other, but the outnumbered BTA delegation scattered soon after the shooting started.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 14 accused allegedly cornered the four BTA taxi owners in their vehicles and kidnapped them. Their bodies were found in a cave in heavy bush near Burgersfort by police four days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four men had had their hands tied behind their backs and had been shot numerous times in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another BTA taxi driver was also robbed of R1500 cash, which he used as a diversion to escape during the clash on Monday, while BTA treasurer, Abraham Mokgoadi (39) was shot in the leg while escaping out of an office window.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POTGIETERSRUS - Police announced on Tuesday that they are investigating the possibility of foul play after discovering the body of a 60-year-old labourer at the bottom of a grain tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joel Maphoto's body was discovered under tonnes of grain by a colleague late on Monday night after a week-long intensive search of the area by police and his employer's, NTK Mielies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maphoto went missing last week and we combed all nearby velds and other open areas but found nothing. Then, apparently by chance, one of his colleagues discovered his body on Monday night when he opened a grain chute,&quot; explained Sergeant Ronel Otto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The company suspects that he may have climbed up a ladder to the top of the 10-metre high tank to check something and then he may have slipped and fallen in. We are not happy with this explanation and will be investigating further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maphoto's body had to be recovered from the grain tank by the Potgietersrus Fire Brigade. No arrests have been made and no charges have been laid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), to Prime Minister Edem Kodjo of Togo.  March 10, 1997.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to strongly protest the February 19, 1997 six-month ban of the independent weekly, &quot;Forum Hebdo&quot; and the sentencing in absentia of publisher Gabriel Agah to a one-year prison term and a 1 million francs CFA (US$1,900) fine. To date, Forum Hebdo has not received official word of the publication ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan organization of journalists committed to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ condemns the ban of Forum Hebdo and the sentencing of Agah as serious violations of press freedom. Furthermore, CPJ believes that imprisonment in no instance constitutes an appropriate response to journalists doing their jobs. These rights are guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, all to which we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Togo is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency, we urge you to do everything within your power to ensure that the ban on &quot;Forum Hebdo&quot; is immediately and unconditionally removed and that Agah is granted a fair trial. We also urge you to guarantee the protection of journalists' sources and the media's right to practice their profession freely and safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Zairean rebels said today that they were within ten kilometers of Kisangani - the last government stronghold in northeastern Zaire - and that the fall of the city is imminent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels say that they have closed in on three fronts and will not stop their push until President Mobutu Sese Seko agrees to face-to-face negotiations. The radio station of the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) said that a corridor had been left open to the west so that civilians and Zairean soldiers from Kisangani could flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leader of the ADFL, Laurent-Desire Kabila told AFP yesterday that his troops had been involved in heavy clashes during their advance on Kisangani.  Kabila said that some of his men had infiltrated into Kisangani, the base for the government's counter-offensive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean Ministry of Defence denies rebel claims and said yesterday that the rebels were at least 50 kilometers away from the city. No independent account of the situation around Kisangani was available, but sources say that the area surrounding Kisangani is heavily mined and that the three main approach roads are manned by government forces and mercenaries. The Belgrade daily &quot;Dnevni Telegraf&quot; alledged yesterday that 5,000 Serb mercenaries were fighting alongside the Zairean Army. Many Kisangani civilians, meanwhile, have fled Kisangani at night by road, in dug out canoes or via chartered flights. In spite of rebel claims that the battle for Kisangani is imminent, Belgium's Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Reginald Moreels, arrived today in Kisangani, bringing medical supplies to the city. Zaire Airlines also said it would go ahead with its scheduled flights to Kisangani on Thursday and Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rwandan sources told Reuters that the two top commanders of the ex-FAR, who have been fighting alongside the Zairean Army, fled Kisangani for Kinshasa last week. Major-General Augustine Bizimungu, commander of Rwanda's ousted 40,000 strong army and his deputy and director of combat operations, Brigadier-General Gratien Kabiligi reportedly left Kisangani to restock supplies for their troops, but did not return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* France's President Jacques Chirac today urged the international community to press for a ceasefire in Zaire and to help the thousands of refugees standed in the fighting. AFP says that diplomatic sources believe France wants the United States, in particular, to apply pressure on Kabila to halt his offensive. Kabila agreed in principle at the weekend to a five point UN peace plan which calls for a ceasefire and the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops, including mercenaries. Kabila has not agreed to a ceasefire but said he would not attack the town of Ubundu, 100 kilometers south of Kisangani, where tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees have arrived. Most of the refugees are from Tingi-Tingi camp which housed 160,000 - 170,000 refugees before it was overrun by rebels last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Heavy rains have begun to fall in eastern Zaire, a factor which western military experts believe may slow down the rebel advance, but will ultimately affect government troops more than the rebels, reports AFP. At the same time, many roads will be impassable and there are concerns that this will hamper plans to set up corridors through rebel-held terriority to facilitate repatriation of Rwandan refugees. Relief agencies said yesterday that they were mounting a relief operation within the next few days in Tingi-Tingi following an inter-agency UN/NGO mission on Sunday. The condition of refugees in Tingi-Tingi is reported to be very poor. Some 400,000 refugees are estimated to be in eastern Zaire: many of them are unaccounted for and are believed to be hiding in the forests. An unknown, but large number, of Zaireans have also been displaced by the fighting and are in need of assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of efforts to assist refugees emerging from the jungle, a way station has been set up by UNHCR in Kinguluba town further to the east towards Rwanda. The station is manned by 10 relief workers, including two UNHCR staff. Stocks of high protein biscuits and medicines have been pre- positioned at the station. A team is also being sent north of Kinguluba to investigate reports of a large number of refugees gathering in Nzofu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* President Mobutu will return to Zaire from southern France before the end of the week for talks on the crisis, said an aide. Mobutu returned to France on 21 February - his third visit since undergoing surgery for prostate cancer last August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* AFP reports that Kabila was hailed as a saviour when he visited Kindu yesterday in what was his furthest visit into the interior since his rebel forces seized swathes of Zaire. Kindu fell to the ADLF on 2 March. In Kindu, Kabila said that his troops had taken Moba in southeast Zaire on Sunday - the last government-held port on Lake Tanganyika. Moise Nyarugabo, a senior official in the rebel leadership, told AFP that Moba had been defended mainly by Burundian rebels loyal to CNDD/FDD leader, Leonard Nyangoma. There has been no independent confirmation that Moba had fallen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean currency, the new Zaire (NZ), is reported to have appreciated sharply against the US dollar in Kindu since the rebel take-over. Residents dealing in the black market told AFP that the dollar was going for around 80, 000 NZ against 150,000 NZ - the level before the city fell. The NZ is running at same rate (80,000 NZ per US dollar) in Goma, the centre of the rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Emma Bonino, EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs, is reported to have said that humanitarian aid in eastern Zaire should not discriminate between the refugees and members of the armed militia. Bonino is quoted as saying at a press conference in Geneva that it was &quot;not our job to be judges&quot; and that assistance should be provided to those who are suffering &quot; whether or not they are criminals or perpetrators of genocide&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said yesterday that allegations by the Zairean Government that the agency's withdrawal from Kisangani had led to thousands of deaths were &quot;simply groundless&quot;. In a communique issued 4 March, the Zairean Government alledged that the departure of humanitarian workers from Tingi-Tingi and Kisangani led to the deaths of 25,000 people. On the same day an expulsion order was issued to those UN and NGO workers who had left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR said that the expulsion was &quot;unfair and unjustified&quot; and rejected Zaire's allegations that it had left Kisangani for no good reason. In a statement issued in Geneva yesterday the High Commissioner, Sadako Ogata, said UNHCR staff &quot;have always taken risks, often substantial risks but they have to remain within reason.&quot; Two UNHCR local staff returned to Kisangani at the weekend to assist in relief distributions to refugees gathering in Ubundu and international staff will be fielded in Punia/Ubundu. UNHCR is also planning to return to the now rebel contolled area of Tingi-Tingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Kenya government is probing the airlifting last week of more than 100 Burundian and Zairean refugees to Kenya. UNHCR has screened the group to determine refugee status. The Daily Nation reported today that sources said another 100 arrived at Wilson airport yesterday, but that this was denied by the government. Amnesty International, meanwhile, has urged the Kenya Government not to return the refugees to Zaire or to their countries of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zambian authorities say that Zairean soldiers who have crossed into Zambia with refugees are causing security problems in the country. &quot; Disillusioned&quot; soldiers are reportedly looting villages and selling arms to survive. The soldiers are said to be heading towards Zambia's Copperbelt province - the hub of Zambia's economy. Some 700 refugees who have entered the country are also unaccounted for, further fuelling concerns that the situation is beyond the government's control. Some 2,200 refugees are reported by local authorities to have arrived in Zambia between October and February. News sources say that relations between Zambia and Zaire, which have been shaky, could plummet further unless the refugee situation is contained. Zambia has complained to Kinshasa on numerous occasions about acts of banditry committed by Zairean nationals. Zairean diplomats have also been accused of giving refuge to the refugees and smuggling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) claims to have taken control of the towns of Kaya and Gumuli in southern Sudan and to be advancing towards Juba, the regional capital. Army spokesman, Major General Mohammed al Sanousi Ahmed claimed on state-run radio that Kaya was first attacked on Sunday by the Ugandan Army who then handed over the town to the SPLA. Uganda's Foreign Minister, Eriya Kategaya denied the claim. The town of Kaya is reported to have been a base for the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) rebels destablising western Uganda. Uganda's Government-owned daily newspaper, the New Vision reported today that the SPLA claimed to have killed 200 Sudanese troops, rebels from the WNBF and the Uganda National Rescue Front II - a splinter group of the WNBF -in their offensive. The New Vision reported yesterday that the SPLA had also taken control of Foki, Kimba, and Bazi along Sudan's border with Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The typhus epidemic first signalled by WHO authorities in Burundi in early February is reported to be spreading. The government regroupment villages are said to be hardest hit because of overcrowding and poor sanitation and health structures. In some villages, as many as 500 to 1,000 new cases are reported daily. Worst hit areas are the provinces of Kayanza, Muramvua and Karuzi. WHO believes some 340,000 people are at risk and that if the epidemic is unchecked it could evolve into the largest typhus outbreak since World War II. WHO has flown in 150,000 tablets to treat typhus cases; however the related issues of sanitation and health conditions will have to be addressed immediately in order to contain the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Female circumcision is performed in more than half of the 46 African countries that are members of WHO, says a WHO report released in Brazzaville yesterday. The report says that more than 100 million women in sub-Saharan Africa are currently affected by sexual mutilation in the form of circumcision. Those affected include young girls between the ages of five and ten. In the Great Lakes region, circumcision is practised in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire. WHO will be launching on 17 March a regional plan to accelerate the elimination of female circumcision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Statement by Mbhazima Shilowa, COSATU General Secretary, March 11 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The test to be applied to tomorrows budget, and indeed future budgets, is the extent to which it is being used as an instrument for transformation. The budget is not an event, nor a technical accounting exercise, but part of an ongoing attempt to shift the social and economic priorities in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in this context that the budget will be assessed, not through a narrow examination of statistics and figures. It is not only the issue of 'how much', but the real question is 'for what', and 'how effectively' the resources are being deployed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 23 March 1995 in a submission to the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on finance, COSATU had this to say about the 1995/6 budget: &quot;When compared to previous apartheid budgets, the 1995/6 budget does have a number of positive features. Judged in terms of the fundamental shift required by the RDP, however, the budget fails to deliver. At best the budget can be described as a transitional budget. We have yet to see our first RDP budget&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous budgets as presented by Derek Keys and Chris Liebenberg had one thing in common. Their credentials while acceptable to the business community, were questionable within the broad progressive movement. While they took their mandate from the cabinet, they had very little or no political authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that sense, the 1997/8 budget is different. The Finance Minister is part of the majority party in the GNU. Labour and the majority of people expect a different budget from him which should underpin the government's commitment to RDP goals and objectives, taking into account the prevailing situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous budgets particularly prior to 1990, were characterised by mismanagement by the National Party. Of course that is my view. They would argue otherwise. What is the evidence? The experience of our people are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Huge inequalities in society: in wealth, income, basic services, infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Expenditure was used to entrench minority rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Public utilities and parastatals provided services and jobs primarily for whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The army and police budgets grew. Not for real law and order situations, but to deny basic political, social and economic rights to the majority, and hence maintain apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The tax burden was consistently shifted from the rich to the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I do not agree with the National Party philosophy, one thing is clear: They demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that the budget is an important instrument for policy implementation at various levels. That is what we would want to see this Government demonstrate rather than merely perform an accounting exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current debate on the budget, have tended to focus on the size of the budget deficit. Targets which were arbitrarily set are then used as yard sticks of success or otherwise of the budget. Constraints on the new government are then used to define our new approach. In my view, while not dismissing the constraints as inherited, I believe that we can develop a different approach. This approach seeks to redefine the debates as focusing on challenges, possibilities and opportunities. In other words, we should acknowledge the existing constraints, but should not allow them to paralyse our approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What therefore is our approach to this year's budget? We need to set out clear yard sticks to measure the progressiveness or otherwise of the budget.  These should include its approach to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Employment creation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Allocation of resources to social needs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Elimination of inequalities within society</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Housing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Land Reform</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Redistribution of wealth and income</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Developing Human Capital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important, we should judge the relationship between revenue and expenditure. The government can choose to move forward in a progressive way, retain the status quo or regress. Some points on Revenue and Expenditure:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revenue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Progressiveness would entail a relook at the taxation regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- More zero rating for basic goods including water, medicines and foodstuffs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Multiple VAT rating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Introduce capital gains tax</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Shift the tax burden away from the poor to the rich and corporations We all know what the consequences of retaining the status quo and regressive taxation will be since this is what we are already sitting with. Inequalities will continue and even widen. The poor will continue to bear the brunt of transformation and subsidise the rich. This is something we should avoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expenditure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this area, progressiveness would entail an increase in social spending, public works, projects for employment creation rather than a cut. Furthermore there needs to be redistribution and reallocation across provinces particularly the rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me now give two of the critical tests we will apply on the budget, to determine whether it is appropriate for our times and our society's needs or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employment Creation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a view that budgets or governments don't create jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- We challenge that view. We accept that Governments are not the only player in the job creation process but it is a very critical player in employment creation. Not only are Government the largest employer, but the way in which they allocate resources can determine whether or not we boost the economy and thereby create jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two elements to this, which we will test:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Firstly does the budget create new jobs - we have put forward proposals on housing and public works programmes, which in our view will stimulate the creation of more than 500 000 jobs. This requires that money be made available though a new housing parastatal. We will look at whether the rolled over funds, and additional funds set aside for 1997/8 starts to address both the quality of public resources, and also the institutional arrangement. We will look at whether a special 3 year levy on the profits of corporations set at say 5% will be introduced, to help finance the housing / public works programme. We are willing to look at a set timespan of say 2-3 years for its implementation. This should include a prescribed asset investment commitment by workers using pension and provident funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Secondly, does the budget destroy current jobs - the budget's impact on current employment is through the allocation of spending in health, education, etc. It is affected by budget deficit targets - smaller government spending on non-debt categories generally imply fewer jobs. Some restructuring of the public sector on the lines supported by labour, may result in redundancies in the old beuracracy, but equally, our proposals for improvement in social services will permit a major increase in new jobs, which will offset this. We will carefully evaluate what balance the budget produces in this area of job creation and job security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This implies that we should combine employment creation for new entrants and the unemployed as well as employment security for those provviding a public service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Social Equity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the features of apartheid was the production of major income inequalities in society. On the measure of the gini-co-efficient, South Africa is one of the most unequal societies in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the legacy of National Party rule, which we expect current government to address. This year's budget can either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- reduce these inequalities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- maintain them at current levels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- increase the inequalities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tools available to the government are both in the area of revenue and expenditure. I am sure that they will want to remove inequalities. If they do want to reduce inequalities, they would need to do the following:.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* introduce a capital gains tax - something which will not be unique to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* set a 55% tax rate on &quot;the super rich&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* tax luxury goods at a higher VAT rate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* increase levels of corporate tax, which have been systematically reduced in recent years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* close loopholes used by the wealthy in South Africa to reduce their tax liabilities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* introduce a levy on the profits of companies to finance housing and public works</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* increase spending on housing, health - care and education (since these are public services and goods which are of disproportional benefit to the poor)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, a failure to implement the above will retain or increase the current inequalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, proposals which:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* increase the VAT on basic goods</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* decrease corporate tax</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* decrease the effective tax of wealthy citizen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* removes exchange controls and hence allow domestic holders of wealth to move it off-shore (beyond the effective reach of government)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* cuts the levels of social spending, Will have the effect of increasing the levels of social inequalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Budget Deficit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We remain opposed to the current way in which budget deficit management is being approached. They have committed themselves to a reduction of 5,1%; 4% etc. We should mobilise the public to understand that budget deficit management is not a mathematical equation. It will result in a cut in social spending, choke the economy, destroy jobs etc. It should be clear on the other hand that we are not opposed to debt management, if it doesn't 'kill the goose that lays the golden egg', ie stifle economic development and narrow the tax base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this year's budget, while there was better participation in NEDLAC by labour on broad parameters, there was very little or no participation on the specific issues of the budget. For the 1998/9 budget we need to ensure involvement from the beginning right to the end. From the time when national priorities are set to when Provinces make their allocation. We also need to encourage our Regions to engage with Provincial governments to ensure that they remain focused to national priorities. If multi-year budgeting is finally introduced, the participation of workers in the process will be even more critical, as budgets will be set, not for one, but several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the challenge we face. It is the challenge that the government can rise to or fail, and thereby address or shatter the hopes of the majority of citizens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Crime-busting is about to get going in Cape Town in a big way as the city moves to overturn international perceptions about the crime threat ahead of the September election of the host city for the 2004 Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about the implications of South Africa's high crime rate have emerged as a threat to the city's chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact the bid has turned out to be the catalyst of a range of practical initiatives to be launched in the next few weeks, not just to boost policing but to deal with the roots of crime to ensure steady, long-term gains.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Establishing, by the end of the month, a Business Against Crime unit, under a board of 15 to 20 top city executives and a full-time chief executive officer, to channel private-sector expertise and resources into the anti- crime drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Launching the first projects under the Integrated Planning Group, formed last year, aimed chiefly at the roots of crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group - comprising &quot;accountable deciders&quot; from the police, army, intelligence, courts, prisons, the city and province, and business - is to meet for a summit next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Projects under this initiative include a programme for rehabilitation of street children; installation of closed-circuit TV in the city centre as a deterrent and policing aid; and the deployment of extra police in the city centre, paid for by business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a UN &quot;Safe Cities&quot; pilot project to be launched in Cape Town is expected to invest significant international expertise in crime prevention.  All these initiatives fall under the National Crime Prevention Strategy of the Department of Safety and Security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional, related initiatives are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Establishing a metropolitan operations centre to manage and co-ordinate the responses of police, traffic officials, ambulance and fire services, hospitals, transport authorities and city officials to every incident in the course of mass events - anything from a hurricane to the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Formulating a &quot;quality assurance checklist&quot; - essentially a tool to provide a comprehensive risk analysis for any big event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Formulating an &quot;operational manual&quot; on the integrated management of big sports or other events. This deals with everything from security to protocol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town's Olympic bid is the catalyst for most of the initiatives, and is likely to enhance their impact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cricket has a habit of saying farewell to its legends in often incongruous fashion. Here was Desmond Haynes, a veteran of 116 test matches and the scorer of about 26 000 first-class runs, bowing out of the game at a sparse Newlands on Sunday after making a duck in his farewell innings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he left the field, Haynes acknowledged the warm response from a small but loyal crowd of Western Province supporters, ripped off his headband and hurled it into a throng of eager children in the Oaks area, and trotted up the steps to the dressing room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was it - the end of a 20-year career which began in Montego Bay in the Caribbean and ended on the other side of the world in Cape Town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day earlier in East London, Peter Kirsten had closed an illustrious chapter before a few hundred people at Buffalo Park after his Border team were whipped by the touring Australians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A majestic century before a packed stadium would have been a more appropriate exit for both, but cricket makes no allowance for reputation.  Haynes at least made a curtain call. Flashing his ever-engaging smile, the 41- year-old emerged on to the balcony outside the Province dressing room and began dispensing with more items of his kit - gloves, T-shirts, even a jock- strap - to a swelling young crowd below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's nice to think that somebody will be keeping a part of me here after I've left,&quot; chuckled 41-year-old Haynes afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty years ago he began his first-class career with Barbados in a match against Jamaica, making nine after being dismissed lbw by Michael Holding, one of the game's greatest pacemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Newlands against Natal on Sunday, Haynes lasted three balls before edging a ball from Gary Gilder, one of South Africa's most promising pacemen, to slip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It summed up how his career had spanned a generation and many countries. &quot; Not in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that my career would end in South Africa,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haynes has spent three seasons in Cape Town as overseas professional with Western Province where he opened the batting, adding stability to what was once an often brittle top-order and leaving it as arguably the strongest on the provincial scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He leaves for England this weekend to fulfil coaching commitments with English county side Sussex, where he also coached last year. But his playing days are over and Haynes admitted it hadn't quite yet sunk in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He almost had to be reminded that he had played 376 first-class games. &quot; That's a lot of games isn't it?&quot; he remarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, cricket has been very good to me, so it will be hard to just stay away from it after playing for so long and enjoying so many benefits,&quot; Haynes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to get involved in encouraging young people to let them know that if you are successful you can make a living from this game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if cricket has been a living for Haynes, golf is his passion and will help fill the void now that he has packed his pads and bats away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever lies in store on the golf course, it will be hard for him to match his achievements on the cricket fields of the world. Haynes was as much a reason for the success of the all-conquering West Indian team of the 1980s and early 1990s as their fearsome quartet of fast bowlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His opening batting combination with fellow Barbadian Gordon Greenidge was the most enduring in the history of test cricket, the pair having faced the new ball together in 89 tests for an average first-wicket stand of 47,3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In limited-overs internationals, Haynes remains the highest run-scorer ever with 8 648 runs from 238 matches, including 17 hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his three seasons with Western Province, he took a while to crack a first-class hundred for his adopted team, until he finally passed the three- figure mark with an unbeaten 202 against Eastern Province in Port Elizabeth in January. But he's never had so many dismissals in the nineties as he has had during his time with Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has given Haynes the most satisfaction, though, is to see the progress of some of the young Province batsmen who have graduated from rookies into genuine match-winners - and in some case, into test players - during his time here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been very pleasing to see the progress of batsmen such as Jacques Kallis, H D Ackerman, Sven Koenig and Herschelle Gibbs,&quot; said Haynes, who is modest about his own input into their development. &quot;I've given a little advice and encouragement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just for these young players to share a partnership with Haynes must be an education in itself. He also made special mention of wicketkeeper Paul Kirsten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haynes has no regrets. He's had a good innings and although he would have liked to have scored at least nine runs on Sunday- he made nine on his debut for Barbados - he had made 83 against Natal in the first innings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, after all, the greatest batsman of all time - Sir Don Bradman - also bowed out with a duck.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Customs duty evasion and poor policing of consumer electronic imports is costing the state at least R2,5 billion in lost customs revenue each year, says Chris de Bruin, the chief executive of Seartec.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is difficult to put an exact number on the lost revenue, but it is certainly considerable,&quot; Mr De Bruin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would say the country loses at least R2,5 billion to evasion of duties and straight smuggling.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seartec, a subsidiary of Seardel, imports Sharp electronic goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duty evasion occurs mainly on audio and video products because they attract the highest import duties of all electronic goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the biggest scams of unscrupulous importers is the manipulation of values of goods to avoid paying duties. They do this by declaring major items which carry higher duties at under cost price while inflating the value of lower duty items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem has become so bad that some legitimate distributors of electronic brands are said to be resorting to buying their own products from third party importers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr De Bruin said Seartec had not and would not do this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I venture to say we are one of the few companies left doing business legitimately,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, 16 of the 18 members of the Consumer Electronics Association signed a minimum values agreement with the Customs Department in an effort to stamp out duty evasion through misrepresenting the value of imported goods.  The agreement details the minimum possible prices for imported electronic goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renier van Rooyen, the managing director of Hicor, said he could not see how goods could be imported for less than these minimum values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hicor retails electronic goods through Audiovision, Audiolens and Hitronix, and wholesales audio and video products through Hi-Fi Specialists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is the build-up of confiscated goods that most worries Mr Van Rooyen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it was nowhere near that found in the clothing and textile industry where the build-up of confiscated goods was threatening the entire industry, the theft of electronic goods from Government warehouses was making business very difficult for some wholesalers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a retailer, we have been offered goods at 40 percent to 50 percent of their value ,&quot; Mr Van Rooyen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr De Bruin and Mr Van Rooyen agree that the only way to stop the evasion and smuggling is to scrap the duties, or to reduce it to a level that would make it more profitable to pay them than evade them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A man and a teenager who murdered three black Hermanus residents in a drunken killing orgy were today given heavy jail sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Justice J H Conradie jailed former bank teller Wilfred Jordaan, 26, of Panorama for an effective 25 years and six months, and a 17-year-old former security guard from Hermanus for 22 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence in their Cape High Court trial was that on September 2 1995, the pair went on a &quot;jol&quot; to &quot;donder a few kaffirs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They murdered Catherine de Wet, Eric Mjikiliso and Nkosana Bushula by bludgeoning them and crushing their skulls with a steering wheel lock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After assaulting Ms De Wet, Jordaan drove over her and after Mr Bushula was beaten, Jordaan stabbed him six times and drove over his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair were also convicted of assaulting Richmond Qwathikazi with intent to do grievous bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordaan was sentenced to 24 years' imprisonment on each of the murder charges and 18 months on the assault charge. The teenager received 21 years for each of the murders and was sentenced to a further year for assault. The murder sentences are to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Justice Conradie said there was no doubt the teenager had been the instigator of the attacks - he had suggested that they &quot;donder a few kaffirs&quot; - but Jordaan had not needed much persuasion to join him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crime destabilises society ... the accused are a danger to society,&quot; said Judge Conradie. &quot;These are young people before me, their lives lie ahead of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In spite of their gruesome deeds I cannot say that they do not deserve a chance to be a part of society one day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - With little room for manoeuvre, and with many competing interests to satisfy, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel is to deliver his first budget in parliament tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Finance Minister Trevor Manuel was appointed last year, some feared that this signalled the end of fiscal prudence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he has consistently promised to gradually reduce the huge deficits he inherited from the apartheid years and there is no reason to doubt that he will maintain this position when he delivers his first budget in Parliament tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, though, he faces increasingly urgent demands from an electorate which needs convincing that the new government can really offer a better life for all. Can he improve social welfare without increasing the mass of taxes and without deepening government's indebtedness?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a tall order by an standard and the business lobby, as vocal in its call for fiscal prudence as it is for tougher measures against crime, would do well to understand the conflicting pressures Mr Manuel is up against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These conflicting pressures are reflected sharply in the argument between business and the unions over over the vexed issue of VAT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business would like Mr Manuel to raise VAT and to do away with exemptions on essential items to finance necessary government spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the trade unions, conscious of the effects this would have on their poorest members, are hostile to the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly Mr Manuel cannot please all sides tomorrow and rather than pull any rabbits out of his hat, he is likely to steer a course between the economy's many competing interests and maintain the cautious approach which has slowly won him the confidence of the financial markets and the respect of his colleagues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Police believe they have broken the back of attacks on tourists in central Cape Town with the arrest of a gang of young &quot;habitual criminals&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gang of children and teenagers between 12 and 18 allegedly operated a syndicate that has been linked to a wide range of crime, including street muggings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their arrests have coincided with a marked drop in attacks on tourists and others in the city, especially after dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police also say the number of attacks on tourists has steadily declined over the past two years as they and business communities in tourist centres have increased their vigilance .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent statistics of reported robberies and assaults on overseas visitors in the Cape Town central business district, the riskiest zone for tourists, showed only 0,02 percent of all foreigners visiting the city - one in 5 000 - were affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Cape police commissioner Leon Wessels has reported a significant reduction in tourist muggings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given a 28 percent increase in the numbers of foreign visitors to Cape Town between 1995 and last year, the 16 percent decrease in attacks was even more significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Records of attacks on tourists over the recent holiday period have also shown a marked drop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town detective George Cook said the arrested gang was made up of &quot; habitual criminals&quot;, some as young as 12. Some had as many as 20 allegations of robbery and theft against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sergeant Cook said that until recently it had been difficult to keep the suspects behind bars, but thorough research into their criminal backgrounds had helped him prove in court they were habitual criminals, leading to their detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although they were young, &quot;the community needs to be protected against them and they need to face up to their deeds, the sooner the better, so that they can be rehabilitated and a get a chance of a new life before they get too old, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's petty thief who rips a gold chain from a tourist's neck and sells it for R5 is tomorrow's burglar and next year's armed robber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time we are able to keep them inside. Up to now they were in and out of places of safety, but now their long lists of crimes have caught up with them,&quot; said Sergeant Cook. He cautioned that the streets were &quot;by no means free of crime&quot; and there were still elements, mostly homeless children, who were not put off by the fate of the arrested gang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another gang of marauding street children has struck since the arrests, their victims an elderly German couple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander Freywald of D/sseldorf and his wife were window-shopping in St George's Mall this week when they were approached by a child of &quot;no older than nine&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He asked us for money and we refused. The next thing I heard my wife shouting and the young scoundrel made off with her gold necklace,&quot; Mr Freywald said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gave chase and with the help of a passerby apprehended the boy, only to find that he no longer had the necklace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They decided to march him to the police depot in Adderley Street, but as they rounded the corner in Darling Street they were confronted by about 20 of the thief's friends, who demanded they free him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing for their lives, they reluctantly released the boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captour head Gordon Oliver said the tourism industry acknowledged the problem of attacks on holidaymakers but criticised the negative picture being presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Oliver urged the community to be partners with the police against crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must do something about the crime threat to our visitors and then go on spending our energy promoting our city to the outside world.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - A wild fruit popular in Zimbabwe for - among other things - making an illicit, highly potent brew called Kachasu, has been found by scientists to have biological qualities useful to the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fruits, locally known as Masawu and whose scientific name is Ziziphus Mauritania, are the main element in the making of Kachasu or Nubian gin, often brewed locally in uncontrolled conditions for liquor with alcohol content as high as 100 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police often battle with the illicit gin brewers and drinkers. Often they are rounded up and have to pay fines for either purveying or taking the highly toxic beverage, whose final brew is mostly said to contain hazardous heavy metals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now the Scientific and Industrial Research and Development Center (SIRDC) says the Masawu fruits contain strong micro-organisms, which can be widely used in food fermentation technologies, as they yield the necessary yeasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We might presently be using very mild yeast in making bread and brewing beer, while there is abundant Masawu, with very high alcohol levels,&quot; says Joseph Gopo, a SIRDC director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gopo told the Zimbabwe Inter Africa News Agency, ZIANA, that at least six micro-organisms constituting lactic bacteria and yeasts, used in fermentation, had been identified in masawu, freely found in abundance in Zimbabwe's forests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other wild fruits, Mazhanje (Uapacha Kirkiana) and Mahacha (Parinari Curatellifolia) have also been found to have useful micro-organisms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Micro-organisms from Mazhanje and Mahacha can produce very nice wine, but at the moment why can't we go into a shop and buy such wine?&quot; said Gopo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These fruits are only a few of those included in a study by the World Association of Industrial and Technological Research Organization (WAITRO), which intends to promote technology for traditional African fermented foods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WAITRO and SIRDC scientists are making efforts to produce a set of guidelines to monitor, evaluate, and control the fermentation process for basic staple foods in selected countries, as well as good codes of hygienic conduct for local processors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientists believe that such fruits as Masawu could have their yeast put to good use with the products made under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can have a controlled level of toxicity and have a product which your blood can tolerate,&quot; said Gopo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's minister of state in the president's office responsible for indigenization, Cephas Msipa, apparently agrees that such measures could be useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could, for instance, find ways of improving the brewing of Kachasu to make it a safe, and good quality product for export,&quot; Msipa said recently at a seminar in Harare on food fermentation technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also encouraged the use of scientific technology in the production, at a commercial level, of other traditional Zimbabwe foods, using fermentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy secretary general of WITRO, Moses Mengu, backed Msipa's view, saying fermented foods constitute a very important and dominant part of the diet for many Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Processing is still predominantly based on traditional methods which increasingly have to meet the needs of an expanding food market especially in urban centers,&quot; said Mengu, who is based in Copenhagen, Denmark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, he said, the risks for contamination, poor quality, and food-borne infections had also increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SIRDC director-general who is also WAITRO's representative in Africa, Christopher Chetsanga, said the biotechnology research institute of SIRDC has taken upon itself to do a study of some of the traditional fermented foods in Zimbabwe, especially those that are almost forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, African food is &quot;conspicuous by its absence&quot; internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it not a pity that one can purchase from virtually any supermarket in Zimbabwe - both urban and remotest rural - European and Asian traditional foods like spaghetti, macaroni and rice, whilst most of our own typical African foods are not available in our local shops, let alone in international markets?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In spite of that, there are many benefits that can be derived from fermented foods. Fermentation forms an important technique for preserving several types of foods, like vegetables, milk, fish, sausages, tea, coffee, cocoa, beans and cereals, in most parts of the world,&quot; Chetsanga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biotechnology research institute's study, he said, was in line with developing expertise and providing services in food processing to enable community enterprises and the food industry to improve zimbabwe's agricultural commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe is one of the countries participating in a three-year WAITRO/SIRDC project started in 1994, which aims at establishing research into traditional fermentation methods and to introduce quality systems into the traditional African food industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project, which is being funded by the European Commission, is in its final year and also involves scientists from institutions in Denmark, Germany, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientists intend to encourage small-scale producers of traditional fermented foods to introduce the concept of quality in their production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their ultimate goal is to see small-scale producers commercializing traditional fermented foods of good quality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Nigerian defence headquarters confirmed Tuesday in Lagos the presence in the country of Foday Sankoh, leader of Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting defence spokesman, Col. Godwin Ugbo, told journalists that Sankoh arrived in the country last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he dismissed a newspaper report that Sankoh entered the country with ammunition and that he had been taken into custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugbo explained that Sankoh had passed through airport formalities hitch- free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not in detention and he's not a threat to our security,&quot; Ugbo said, adding that Sankoh was staying at a federal government guest house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The RUF leader is free to enter into the country as a West African national,&quot; Ugbo added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Sankoh had recognized the government in Sierra Leone and could not be regarded as a rebel leader anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugbo did not say how long Sankoh would be staying in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RUF has been waging a bush war against the Freetown government over the past six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides signed a peace agreement in Cote d'Ivoire in November 199 to end the war, in which at least 15,000 people died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria and Sierra Leone signed a military pact in Lagos last week for the training of that country's military personnel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Sixteen Nigerians, among them exiled nobel literature laureate Wole Soyinka, were charged with treason Wednesday before a chief magistrate's court in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are accused of conspiracy and bomb explosions, between May 1995 and Feb. 10 1997, to overthrow Nigeria's military government of Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has witnessed a series of bomb explosions, including three in recent months in Lagos, which killed at least three soldiers and injured scores more.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treason charge sheet alleged that the men conspired &quot;to cause explosion in various parts of Nigeria in order to intimidate and over-awe the head of state of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soyinka, who fled the country in 1994, was charged in absentia, along with Amos Arogundade, and two officials of NADECO, the opposition National Democratic Coalition. So too were Alani Akinrinade, a retired army general, and Anthony Enahoro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 12 other accused were in court to hear the charge. They included NADECO leaders Olu Falae and Fredrick Fasheun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treason carries the death sentence in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian authorities have accused NADECO and the National Liberation Council of Nigeria, led by Soyinka, of being behind acts of terrorism, including the recent bomb blasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups, which are waging a campaign to end military rule in Nigeria, are also accused of being behind a pirate radio station which transmits anti- government messages and programes to Nigeria on a shortwave frequency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos human rights campaigner Gani Fewehinmi is leading a team of nine lawyers in defence of the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the lawyers, Femi Falana, told the court it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also claimed that the alleged offenses were being made known in court for the first time to his clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arguing for bail on behalf of his clients, Falana asked the court to note that while the suspects were in detention, there had been a series of bomb blasts in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecuting Police Superintendent Nuhu Ribadu objected to bail. He said the accused would jump bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Magistrate Betty Lufadeju said even though a section of Nigeria's criminal procedure law permitted the court to grant bail, &quot;this is not applicable in this case because it is a capital offence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, she dismissed the bail application and ordered the accused to be remanded in police custody. The case adjourned till May 9.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - United States first lady Hillary Clinton begins a six-nation Africa tour Saturday aimed at highlighting the progress these countries have made in consolidating democracy, the Press Attache at U.S.  Cultural Center said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, Karen Sullivan, said Clinton had been asked by her husband, President Bill Clinton, and by the Department of State to make the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By undertaking this tour, Sullivan said, Clinton will also be restating &quot; her commitment to the well-being of children,&quot; the empowerment of women, children's programmes, human rights, and to social investment such as in education, health care, and micro-enterprises.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She begins her visit with Senegal where, as in the other countries on her itinerary, she will inspect projects funded by local and international non- governmental organizations such as Tostaan, Unicef, the American Jewish Worlds Service, and by the United States Agency for International Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton is due to meet Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, visit a former slave holding station on the Island of Goree, three kilometers West of Dakar, in the Atlantic Ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the town of Thies, 70 kilometers east of Dakar, she will Monday visit a women's literacy program run by the American non-governmental agency, Tostaan.  Then, visit the Peace Corps training center in the same town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After her two-day visit to Senegal, she leaves Monday for Johannesburg, South Africa; Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Uganda and Eritrea, in that order.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - A four-day national symposium on the draft policy of culture opened here yesterday at the Yared Music School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Worku Nida, head of the Department of culture in the Ministry of Information and Culture, over 200 professionals, elders members of religious institutions, renowned individuals, representatives from women's affairs bureaux and governmental and non-governmental organizations drawn from 10 regional states and the Administration of Dire Dawa are attending the symposium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the symposium, Ato Wolde-Michael Chemu, Minister of Information and Culture noted that Ethiopia was one of the forefront countries renowned for its long history and diverse cultures the source of which was the existence of ore than 80 nations and nationalities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister recalled that absence of constitutional guarantee and unequal treatment of cultures in the past were the impediments in the way of promoting such cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past the Ethiopian nationalities had fought against these negative influences which now enabled them to exercise their cultural rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As neglecting ones culture can only mean disregarding one's identity and the well-being of the culture itself, the minister noted that the government, would pay due attention to the development of culture and to this end having a defined policy on culture was necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the absence of such a policy in the past proved the then governments' negligence to respect the culture of the Ethiopian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He finally admonished participants to pay attention to five basic points - that the policy should not be against the basic rights of the peoples of all nations and nationalities should not include points that militate against the peaceful relations and coexistence of all peoples, should reflect that cultural activity is the basis for all other developmental activities, that it(the policy) should not make gender discrimination and that it should be reliable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of research papers such as, what is the Necessity for the Study of What Culture Is and Its Development, Activities of Art in Ethiopia-short survey, Women and Culture. The Foundation of the Academy of Ethiopian Languages and its Activities and other will be presented at the symposium it was learned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - House Speaker Dawit Yohannes said the House had registered significant achievements over the past 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told journalists that the House, besides issuing proclamations to implement the five-year development programme and provisions enshrined in the constitution, is closely assessing and following up the activities of the executive bodies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House has reviewed the performance of the executive body with an objective to look into constraints, he said, adding despite capacity limitation in some sections the overall endeavour was satisfactory and commensurate to the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Dawit said the Police College, Prison Administration, Awash Arba Training Centre and the Air Force inspected by the Defence and Security Committee of the House despite existing financial constraints have scored significant achievements adding the House would see to it that priority is given to support them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participation of members in discussions held in the House has shown significant improvement, he said and indicated that the major problem was inability to devise a means for close contact and communication between MPs and their constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bid to overcome such a problem, members are expected to return with demands from their respective constituencies after the summer recesses, Ato Dawit said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - At the 3748th meeting of the Security Council, held on 7 March 1997 in connection with the Council's consideration of the item entitled &quot;The situation in the Great Lakes region&quot;, the President of the Security Council made the following statement on behalf of the Council:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council expresses its grave concern at the deteriorating situation in the Great Lakes region, in particular in eastern Zaire. It underlines the urgent need for a comprehensive and coordinated response by the international community in support of the efforts of the joint United Nations/Organization of African Unity Special Representative for the Great Lakes region to prevent any further escalation of the crisis there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council reiterates, in that respect, its full support for the five-point peace plan for eastern Zaire contained in its resolution 1097 (1997) of 18 February 1997 and welcomes the endorsement of that plan by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its 65th ordinary session of the Council of Ministers held in Tripoli from 24 to 28 February 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the declaration of the Government of Zaire of 5 March 1997 (S/1997/197, annex) regarding its acceptance of the United Nations peace plan endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 1097 (1997).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council calls upon the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo/Zaire to declare publicly their acceptance of resolution 1097 (1997) in all its provisions, in particular an immediate cessation of hostilities, and calls on all parties to implement its provisions without delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council is concerned about the effect which the continued fighting is having on the refugees and inhabitants of the region and calls upon all parties to allow access by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and humanitarian agencies to refugees and displaced persons and to guarantee the safety of refugees and displaced persons as well as United Nations and humanitarian aid workers. It also takes note with concern of allegations of violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict zone and welcomes the sending of a United Nations fact finding mission to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council reiterates its full support for the joint United Nations/OAU Special Representative for the Great Lakes region and urges all Governments in the region and all the parties concerned to cooperate with him fully. It also urges the parties to the conflict to begin, under his auspices, a dialogue in order to achieve a lasting political settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council welcomes all efforts, including those of the Organizations and States of the region, aimed at resolving the crisis, including the initiative of President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya to convene another regional meeting in Nairobi on 19 March 1997 and the initiative of the OAU to organize a summit of the members of the Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution on the Great Lakes region in Lome before the end of March 1997. The Council encourages other facilitators and representatives of the regional organizations, including the European Union and the States concerned, to coordinate closely their efforts with those of the Special Representative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council reaffirms the importance of holding an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region under the auspices of the United Nations and the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council expresses its gratitude to the Secretary-General for keeping it informed of developments in the Great Lakes region and requests him to continue to do so on a regular basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council will remain actively seized of the matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The demonstration in Johannesburg today, Wednesday 12 March has left a trail of blood in and around Johannesburg. The demonstration indicates a similar pattern to the march before the April 1994 elections when a group of marchers attempted an assault on the ANC headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the march had been advertised as a &quot;Zulu March&quot;, nothing is further from the truth. It is instructive to note that many of the marchers were wearing IFP T-shirts and included members of the Self Protection Units (SPU's).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994 permission was sought for a march allegedly organised by &quot;Zulus&quot; but the application was on an IFP letterhead. It would be unfortunate if a perception were to develop that the march was an attempt by the IFP to misuse the name of Zulu speaking people to perpetuate their own party political objectives. We call on the IFP to clarify its standpoint on this matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long before the scheduled time of the march, demonstrators were spreading panic by assaulting, wounding scores of innocent people in Soweto, Johannesburg and Ikwezi Station, Merafe, Dube, Nancefield, Mzimhlophe, Diepkloof and George Goch hostels. Two people are reported to have been killed by the demonstrators on their way to the march. Events leading to the march were reported as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soweto -shots fired in the air on Tuesday night from Merafe and Diepkloof hostels - roads barricaded at Nancefield and Jabulani hostels - a man seriously wounded near Merafe hostel - shots fired and stones thrown at a bus driving past Jabulani hostel - a bus set alight near Nancefield hostel - two dead bodies found near Merafe hostel - a person wounded from a bullet fired from a taxi driving past Dube hostel - commuters assaulted on a train from Vereeniging - a man seriously wounded when he was shot in the back at Mzimhlophe hostel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">East Rand - intimidation of the general public reported - roads barricaded in Vosloorus and Wattville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - a man seriously wounded when marchers hacked him with a panga in the city - a bystander shot in the leg in Jeppestown at corner Maddison and Page streets - a woman shot at in an office in Maddison street when shots were fired - a man shot in the head at the George Goch railway station - a man wounded in the head at the Carlton Hotel - hawkers in the city centre forced to flee when the marchers scattered their goods</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas the ANC respects the rights of political parties and sectors of society to embark on different forms of protest, we insist that those who organised today's events also had a responsibility to ensure it did not degenerate into chaos, lawlessness and public disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events leading up to the march indicate that the organisers have dismally failed to ensure the demonstration was conducted within the parameters of public order. Consequently, the organisers bear the primary responsibility for the death of the two people near Merafe hostel, injury to scores of other people in Soweto and the Johannesburg city centre.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Action Alert on Algeria from the International Women's Human Rights Law Clinic at the City University of New York</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an urgent request for your assistance in demanding that the United States government deny political asylum or withholding of deporataion to Anwar Haddam, a key leader, policy maker and spokesperson for the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and Armed Islamic Group (GIA), two of the most extreme and significant terrorist groups in Algeria today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anwar Haddam is in the custody of the INS and has made a claim for political asylum. Under U.S. law, Anwar Haddam is not entitled to asylum or withholding of deportation because he has &quot;ordered, inited, assisted of otherwise participated in the persecution&quot; of others. It is the obligation of the federal government, and particularly of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), to enforce this law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there is concern that the United States government may make a deal with Haddam, either giving him political asylum or withholding deportation and thereby allowing him to remain in the country. Either result would be abhorrent and provide him a cloak of legal, moral and political legitimacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his official capacity as a leader and representative of FIS and GIA, Anwar Haddam has assisted and participated in a criminal campaign of terror against civil society in Algeria, targeting indepedent democrats, intellectuals, feminists and women who do not conform to Islamist dictates, as well as journalists and foreigners. The acts of terror include assassination and summary execution; beheading and mutilation; hijacking and hostage-taking; and the burning of schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stated goal of this campaign-- which FIS/GIA call a jihad or holy war-- is to establish a theocratic state that would function according to tenets comparable to those enunciated by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Like the Taliban, the FIS/GIA call for and enforce through violence and terror, the complete segregation of men and women in public life and the obedience of women to their version of Islam. Particularly vicious acts of violence against women in Algeria have included the beheading of a young girl who appeared in public without a veil; and the kidnapping, rape and murder of young wmen who have been forced into &quot;temporary mariages&quot; and held in sexual slavery at the secret bases of militant terrorist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anwar Haddam has played a significant role in the planning and conduct of these terror campaigns, and has also claimed the power to stop it if the FIS/GIA demands are met. As spokesman for FIS/GIA, he has publicly justified and applauded brutal assassinations and bombings. He is currently the target of an investigation by the French government into bombings in France; it is believed that there is a sealed indictment and strong evidence against him in this connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As detailed in the attached press release issued by the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York City, on December 17, 1996 a group of women's rights advocates, intellectuals, journalists and poitical democrats from Algeria filed suit in the federal district court in Washington, D.C.  charging Haddam and FIS with crimes against humanity and other egregious violations of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anwar Haddam has resided in the U.S. acting as representative of the FIS, since 1993. In the fall of 1996, his initial claim for asylum was denied and he was subsequently arrested by the INS. Once in custody, he renewed his request for political asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's groups and advocates of religious tolerance and democratic ideals around the world are outraged that the United States would consider providing this kind of protection to Anwar Haddam and his terrorist organizations. Not only would such an action by the U.S. government provide a veneer of legitimacy to Haddam and FIS/GIA, it would send a message to terrorists in many parts of the world that the United States is prepared to give them explicit or tacit protection. It would also communicate to all who struggle against such terror that gross violations of their human rights do not matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We therefore call on the United States government to firmly oppose Anwar Haddam's claim for political asylum and to pursue his involuntary deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please fax letters stating your concern to: President Clinton (202) 456- 2461, Attorney General Janet Reno (202) 514-4371, Secretary of State Madeline Albright (202) 647-7120, Director of INS Doris Meisner (202) 514-3296.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Contacts between Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) rebels and the Zairean opposition are increasing.  Jacques Matanda, a key member of Tshisekedi's entourage arrived in Kampala a week and a half ago, according to well-placed sources in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his arrival, he has allegedly had regular meetings with representatives of the ADFL stationed in Kampala. According to a Zairean opposition paper Umoja, Joseph Olenghankoy, leader of the opposition group in the HCR-PT parliament and the national leader of the FONUS party, is out of Zaire and is reportedly meeting with ADFL representatives. Olenghankoy is also considered to be a key member of Tshisekedi's entourage. At a press conference last Saturday, FONUS called for tripartite negotiations between Mobutu, Kabila and Tshisekedi to end the current crisis. The UDPS opposition paper, Tempete Des Tropiques, reported that the national secretary of Tshisekedi's UDPS party, Ms Justine Mpoyo Kasavubu recently meet with rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma. Ms Kasavubu is the daughter of Zaire's first President Joseph Kasavubu and has not returned to Zaire since the death of her father. She represents the UDPS in Europe. Her arrival in Goma apparently occasioned the &quot;red carpet treatment&quot; from the ADFL. UDPS claims this visit is part of their peace initiative aimed at solving the current crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* As the siege of Kisangani continues, Zairean rebels allegedly associated with the ADFL have been reported on other fronts. Recently, members of the Gendarmes Katanganist have allegedly been spotted in Bukavu with the ADFL forces, according to Zairean press and other sources. They are members of the former Shaba seccessist forces who were defeated by Mobutu in the 1977 and 1978 Shaba wars. Following their defeat, the Gendarmes joined forces with the Angolan government. Their numbers, according to Zairean newspaper Le Palmares, between 1,500 to 4,000 strong, have since been reinforced by new recruits from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military forces have also been spotted in Cabinda, an enclave annexed to Angola and located on the Atlantic coast sandwiched between Congo and Zaire.  According to the Zairean paper La Reference le Plus, General Estanislau Miguel Boma, the commander-in-chief of the Cabinda army (Force Armee Cabindist-FAC), claimed that there is a large concentration of well armed military personnel in Cabinda. These soldiers are reportedly Swahili speakers who do not speak a word of Portuguese. He claimed that they appear to be waiting for orders to move on Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* AFP reported today that the US State Department has authorised the voluntary departure of dependents of US Embassy employees in Zaire and has urged US citizens in Zaire to consider carefully their personal security. It has also advised US citizens to defer travel to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* French President Jacques Chirac, denounced a &quot;conspiracy of silence&quot; on Zaire yesterday and appealed to the international community to force a ceasefire and undertake urgent humanitarian action. A spokesman for Chirac said that the humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire was tragic and that no- one can ignore it any longer. France has favoured the deployment of a multi- national force to restore order in eastern Zaire, a call which has been not well-received by both the US and Britain. The US State Department told correspondents yesterday that it shared France's sense of frustration with the situation in Zaire, but favoured &quot;political persuasion&quot; over the deployment of a multi-national force. Nicholas Burns, a spokesman for the Department said that the US is urging Kabila to accept a ceasefire and speed up the delivery of relief assistance. Canada, which took the initative in putting together the multi-national force last year is adopting a wait and see attitude. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Canada would consider the request if it were made by the Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President of Madagascar, Didier Ratsiraka warned yesterday that if Zaire were to break up, Nigeria and other African countries could follow suit.  Following a meeting with President Chirac he said: &quot;We must settle things as soon as possible to prevent (the troubles) spreading&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* South African President Nelson Mandela will probably attend a summit with Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko and other African leaders, a presidential spokesman said. The summit which is tentatively planned for Wednesday or Thursday is scheduled to take place in Nairobi. South Africa, meanwhile, says it is pressing ahead with its efforts to bring peace to Zaire but says that &quot; has no magic formula&quot;. Deputy Foreign Miniuster Aziz Pahad said that South Africa was in constant touch with the Joint OAU/UN Special Representative, Mohamed Sahnoun and its next course of action would be based on his advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The first Rwandan minors accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda may go on trial in Kigali at the end of April, UNICEF reported yesterday. Special courts have been set up to hear the cases and members of the NGO Lawyers Without Borders have received special training in prosecuting and defending the cases. A UNICEF fact sheet said that some 2,000 minors were waiting to go on trial for offences connected with the 1994 genocide. None of the children will be tried under the first category of genocide crimes, which carries an automatic death sentence. According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, as of December 31 1996, some 2,137 children, including 72 girls, were being held in Rwandan prisons. An additional 568 children are accompanying their mothers, who are in prison under charges of genocide. The figure also does not take into account 197 boys who were under the age of 14 at the time of the crime and are not considered criminally responsible, but are being detained nevertheless. Many are being held in a special wing of Kabuga prison and a number of detention centres, most of which have been rehabilitated by UNICEF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There are some 254,000 refugees in Tanzania. Since 1993, Kasulu district alone has seen a large influx of refugees from Burundi and now Zaire. Some 113,000 refugees are sheltered in 3 camps: Mtabila (27,000 Burundians), Moyovosi (40,000 Burundians) and Nyarugusu (45,000 Zaireans). Following the ADFL offensive in late 1996, some 1,000 to 1,500 refugees have arrived in the area daily. The Burundian refugees have been crossing directly from Burundi into Kasulu. However, around 80% of the new arrivals are Zaireans. They arrive along the shore of lake Tanganika from where UNHCR collects them by boat and transfers them to Kigoma transit centres. Many believe that there are an even greater number of Zaireans who have not made it to the refugee centres. Refugees from Zaire are thought to be still crossing the lake, although agencies believe that the numbers are declining. ADFL rebels now control almost all of the western shore of lake Tanganyika. Aid workers in the area have said that the opening of new camps has not kept up with the demand. Many of the new camps have only a limited capacity, which fill up quickly. Many of the transit centres in Kigoma town are overcrowded, some containing 2 to 3 times their normal capacity. The logistic capacity to transfer the refugees from the transit centres to the camps is also said to be inadequate to the need.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The powerful Life Offices Association, which represents the multi-billion life assurance industry, is not under threat of collapse because of a dispute with Liberty Life, says executive director Jurie Wessels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I honestly don't think there is a chance of the Life Offices Association (LOA) breaking up,&quot; Mr Wessels told the Cape Argus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LOA is the self-regulatory body of the life insurance industry. It is also the representative body of the industry in its dealings with the Government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Wessels said if it disappeared Government would have to step in with &quot;a lot of legislation&quot; to take the place of the self-regulation or the man in the street would be in a very vulnerable position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association was a very useful instrument for its members to try and influence their operating environment, but Mr Wessels conceded that the circumstances surrounding the dispute with Liberty could force the LOA to change some aspects of its code of conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle with Liberty revolves around its decision to award payments to brokers using its new Blue Print system. The Financial Services Board has construed the payments as a transgression of the Insurance Act in that brokers' commissions would then exceed the maximum commission provided for in the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this particular case, Liberty is doing something which is not specifically addressed in the law and there is a difference of interpretation, &quot; Mr Wessels said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some members say what Liberty is doing definitely a contravention of the law, and Liberty disagrees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberty, however, has said that the Blue Print system allows brokers to do the administration themselves, and they are simply being paid for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Wessels said the fundamental question was not really how to deal with Liberty, but rather about having commissions regulated in law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are the only industry that has commissions regulated by law - it's a good consumer protection measure - but it does put us at a competitive disadvantage,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For instance, the mutual fund industry (unit trusts) can pay higher commissions than we can for competing investments - that is really what is behind the dispute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Wessels said the industry would now have to take a fundamental view on whether or not commissions should continue to be regulated in law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It may happen that the LOA will have to concede that there are certain things which are so competitive in nature that the association does not have the power to regulate them...and pass the ball back to the Government to clarify the law or make new law. The LOA's role would be diminished, but it certainly won't break up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Although internationally-recognised artist Frank Brown has been living for 25 years on the east coast of America in the harbour city of Baltimore, his heart still lies in the seaport of his birth at the tip of Africa - Simon's Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking like a top basketball player of yesteryear (he's 2,4m tall), Frank, 61, greets you with an American accent, putting you at ease with a few words of warm welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, without further ado, he dispenses with formalities and ushers you into his holiday bungalow behind his sister's home in Ocean View, near Kommetjie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he was filled with emotion on arriving here recently for a two- month holiday because the house is the same one in which he, his parents, sisters and brothers were relocated after being uprooted under apartheid's Group Areas Act from Dido Valley Road in Simon's Town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank recalls vividly how he started from humble beginnings as an artist and was propelled almost overnight into international newspaper headlines. It happened through a chance encounter with a beach photographer, who filmed him collecting chunks of driftwood and fashioning them into pieces of polished sculpture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His career took off after the publication of several magazine features about him and, with the extra money he earned, he was able to improve his artistic skills by taking a two-year course at UCT's Michaelis School of Art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today his works appear in private collections in many parts of the world and famous personalities who have examples of his sculptures include Helen Suzman, Senator Edward Kennedy and Bill Cosby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Frank also underwent a metamorphosis and wanted to improve his educational qualifications to become a teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time he believed that matriculating and entering Hewat Teacher's Training College was not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bombay University offered him a scholarship, but he was repeatedly denied a passport to India over a period of 13 years by the apartheid government. He says his life during that period was a &quot;void&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undaunted he continued to apply for other scholarships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time he was 30 he had received offers of four scholarships, and he was eventually granted a passport to study in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After gaining a BSc degree in Art Education, he obtained a Masters Degree in Art History at the Maryland Institute College of Art, at Morgan State University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was 37 when he finally qualified and started teaching at American high schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says: &quot;Although it's been a long, hard road to success I am still brimming with zest and creativity. But I won't forgive or forget those missing years.&quot; Frank, the eldest of 11 children in a poor family, rose above the strictures of his environment in a disadvantaged community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He discovered he had had a flair for art and sculpture at an early age. He also had a driving ambition to better himself through education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recalls how he helped his parents make ends meet by working as a newspaper vendor selling the Cape Argus at Simon's Town station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This led him to becoming an avid reader and it also sparked off his desire to explore the world and to be a lecturer and scholar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank now teaches social studies, geography and English at the Joseph C Briscoe High School in Baltimore, and he says: &quot;Today art is mostly a secondary subject for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bid to gain some sort of compensation for his lost years Frank and his wife, Sylvia, wrote to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and volunteered to testify about the scars left by apartheid on their lives. They were dismayed to learn they did not qualify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Boraine, TRC vice-chairperson, told them in a letter that the TRC was listening daily to the stories of people whose families had been murdered and of people who had been assassinated, who had disappeared and who had been tortured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think these are the priorities, because these priorities are laid down in the Act,&quot; Dr Boraine wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reply continued: &quot;Of course many, many people, including yourselves, were deeply hurt and scarred by the crimes of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may wish to raise this matter directly with the Minister of Justice so that your request for compensation can be looked at by another commission, committee or department.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Western Cape police allegedly treat gangsters and drug dealers with kid gloves, close gang-related dockets before investigations are complete and downgrade drug-dealing charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These and other allegations of &quot;widespread and systematic&quot; police corruption were made to Minister of Safety and Security Sydney Mufamadi in a confidential briefing by University of Cape Town criminologist Wilfried Schd rf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was leaked to the Cape Argus this week. Professor Schdrf said the report was a confidential matter between himself and Mr Mufamadi and that he was not prepared to comment further.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Schdrf was appointed two years ago as a civilian investigator to probe allegations of police corruption and complicity with gangsters, but gave up last August because of lack of co-operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A team of top police detectives was appointed to continue the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the briefing, Professor Schdrf told Mr Mufamadi a number of policemen had confided in him about their own experiences and what they had heard about alleged wrongdoing of colleagues. &quot;Based on what the policemen told me and what respected community leaders were saying at the time, I made public statements to the effect that there was widespread and systematic corruption in the Western Cape police,&quot; he told Mr Mufamadi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drug syndicates and gangs were involved in big business operations and there were vast amounts of money at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dirty&quot; senior officers had a lot to lose financially and professionally by being exposed and did everything in their power to conceal their activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the police involved in such activities suspect they are being investigated, they will conceal their activities by more skilful means. They know police investigative methods, can think one step ahead and have friends in places where they can monitor the progress of the probe against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every docket that is opened has to be registered on the computer. Any suspect within the agency who has access to a computer can look up whether there is a case under investigation against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another problem is that it is extremely dangerous for police personnel to squeal on their colleagues, as they fear for their jobs should they make a formal complaint, as often the allegations will be investigated by friends of those accused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Schdrf said it was wrong that police who knew of wrongdoing by colleagues and superiors could find no trustworthy authority to which to report them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Security police strangled an &quot;unknown&quot; activist with a piece of wire during interrogation and &quot;necklaced&quot; his body to disguise their involvement in his death, the amnesty committee has heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also heard that the security police bound at least one other &quot;unknown&quot; activist to a telephone pole and blew him up with a limpet mine to make it look as though he had died by mistake while on sabotage mission. He was already dead when blown up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was possible a second activist had been disposed of similarly, the amnesty committee was told during its hearing in Cape Town yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was testimony by two of five former Northern Transvaal security policemen seeking amnesty for more than 40 state-sponsored murders, bombings and assassinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul van Vuuren, a warrant officer, said he and Vlakplaas &quot;askari&quot; (turned African National Congress guerrilla) Joe Mamasela had abducted the &quot;necklaced&quot; activist in Mamelodi, Pretoria, in 1986 or 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unnamed man had been identified as an ANC activist or &quot;terrorist&quot; by Harold Sefola, leader of an ANC cell, during a torture session in which Mr Sefola had been given shocks with a portable generator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sefola had later been electrocuted with the generator after being allowed to sing Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, the amnesty committee had heard in Johannesburg last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Warrant Officer Van Vuuren said that while they were driving with their captive in a minibus, his superior officer, Jacques Hechter - one of the five applying for amnesty - throttled the captive with a length of wire &quot;to get information out of him&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was throttled to death during the interrogation, whereafter we drove to a deserted road in Bophuthatswana. We unloaded him, poured petrol over him, put a tyre on him and set him alight so that it should look as though he died as a result of 'necklacing'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Hechter testified that he tied a dead activist to a telephone pole and blew him up with a limpet mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot remember at all how he died ... I cannot remember where it happened. I am not dead sure, but I imagine a second activist was eliminated in the same way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has told the amnesty committee he had serious memory problems and could not remember most of the incidents for which he was applying for amnesty, although he did not deny being involved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Just days before the official opening, construction workers are burning the midnight oil to put the finishing touches to the majestic R250- million Table Bay Hotel at the Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a prime position at Quay 6 with views of the mountain or sea from every room, the super-luxury establishment is destined to become one of the world's premier hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sun International's first South African in-city hotel, it is an impressive blend of modern sophistication and old-style elegance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is one of several new hotels in the works, including a 400-room Hilton and a 300-room Marriott, which will dramatically change the face of accommodation in the Mother City and enhance its standing as a premier tourist destination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Douglas, Sun International regional director of development in the Western Cape, said the hotel group wanted to provide services and design which would enhance the beauty of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tourism is a competitive environment and we are carefully examining the market, the demographics and desires of the people of Cape Town. We regard the operation of a world-class, relatively small hotel as the beginning of increasingly impressive developments in the Western Cape - an area which is attracting a growing, discerning international tourist market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the moment you turn into the palm-tree lined entrance to the Table Bay, you are struck by the beauty of the building. Every bedroom has a view of Table Mountain or the sea to Robben Island and beyond and there are spectacular views of Cape Town from all the public rooms, walkways and outdoor areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guests will have direct access to the wide variety of entertainment, shopping and business facilities at the Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 16 months ago, not a single brick had been laid and today, the hotel's 400-odd staff members are rushing around frantically in preparation for the arrival of the first guests on April 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Sun International Cape flagship boasts spectacular floor, wall and ceiling finishes - with giant murals, friezes, fountains and pillars sculpted in the minutest detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hotel has 329 rooms and a number of public rooms, bars and restaurants.  Facilities include the 188-seat Atlantic Grill restaurant, a 94-seat conservatory, a 66-seat lounge, a ballroom and a business centre with boardrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hotel general manager Jean Mestriner is clearly eagerly anticipating its opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a city famed for its natural beauty and superior hotels, the Table Bay will be in a class of its own,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Finance Minister Trevor Manuel today handed out billions of rands in poverty relief and lightened the load on low-income taxpayers in his debut Budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also kept his promise to cut the Government's deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sobering news for drinkers and smokers, though, is that &quot;sin taxes&quot; are up sharply again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pack of 20 cigarettes will cost 54c more, while beer goes up 3c a can.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exchange controls are to be significantly relaxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hallmark of the R186,7-billion Budget is a tight rein on government spending, with a significant shift of emphasis to spending on social development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a tough Budget - it demands substantially more austerity from government than many of its forerunners have,&quot; he told Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Budget tells the story of a government determined to effect deep transformation and to live within its means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Manuel said the cut in the deficit, from 5,1 percent of gross domestic product last year to 4 percent, had been achieved without new taxes or net tax increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first year in many we have been able to provide tax relief to working people,&quot; he said, referring to the R2,8-billion tax saving for people at the bottom end of the scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting the Budget, Mr Manuel said: &quot;In this Budget we make a substantial allocation to poverty relief; we invest in people through a significant reprioritisation of expenditures in favour of social development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are bold in the further integration of South Africa into the global economy by the freeing up of exchange controls; we provide tax relief for those on incomes up to R60 000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a budgeted cut in the marketable securities tax would boost the competitiveness of South Africa's financial markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 60 percent of national and provincial spending will go to social services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This includes big boosts for education and health spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tackling the vexed issue of crime, the Government has dedicated R406- million to the National Crime Prevention Strategy, which will cost R902- million and run for three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spending on police, justice and correctional services will go up by about 15 percent, taking into account improvements in conditions of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This provides a clear indication of the seriousness with which the Government is approaching the issue of crime,&quot; Mr Manuel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all these departments, particularly the police, steps were being taken to improve management of resources, including extensive training initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing revenue measures, Mr Manuel committed the Government to further tougher measures against people evading and failing to pay tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government will more vigorously enforce the tax legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We shall actively pursue anyone who breaks the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steps announced today include requiring people who want government contracts to prove they are registered taxpayers and sign a certificate that their tax affairs are in good order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar steps will have to be taken by people wanting foreign currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax relief for low-income earners will be partly offset by better tax collection, expected to yield R800-million this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As expected, Mr Manuel stopped short of a VAT increase. But improved VAT collections should put an extra R400-million in the state's coffers this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Budgeted revenue of R161,98-billion will leave the Government short of some R24,77-million this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deficit will be financed mostly from foreign and domestic borrowing, as well as from the proceeds of privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sale of a 30 percent stake in Telkom is expected to yield R516-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Manuel's long-awaited announcement on the phasing out of exchange controls included what he called &quot;profound&quot; changes. As expected, the new measures benefit indidivuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, he predicted a 2 percent growth in the economy this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - A wait-and-see attitude prevails in Uganda ahead of the expiry Friday of the deadline requiring Ugandans holding high public office to declare their assets, as a measure to stamp out widespread corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although in recent years Uganda has often been cited as a model in efficient economic management, corruption is so widespread that an international anti-corruption organization, Transparency International, said the East African country was a leader in this vice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni set the anti-corruption tune when he announced that he had declared his assets before standing for the May 1996 polls, and as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Inspector General of Government, Jotham Tumwesigye, whose post is the equivalent of an Ombudsman, said recently that 40 members of parliament were yet to fulfill the terms under the country's Leadership Code.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told journalists that all ministers, except one, had declared their assets. However, Tumwesigye declined to divulge their names, their wealth, let alone that of the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the code, political leaders are required to declare their assets, liabilities and earnings. They are also expected to declare loans and whether they had ever been charged for criminal offence or employed by foreign firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is evident is that the Leadership Code, which was enacted five years ago and assented to by Museveni, has remained a dead letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abu Mayanja, a former deputy prime minister and justice minister, attributed the situation to lack of budgetary allocations. This has meant tht the Leadership Code Commission, set up to curb top level corruption, has been unable to enforce the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The code also requires ranking officials in 21 districts and those in state- owned firms to declare their assets by March 15 and 30, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In keeping with his election manifesto, Museveni has pledged that his government would continue its battle against corruption and abuse of office in high places of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, he appointed Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe to lead the anti- corruption crusade, prompted by a public outcry that many leaders had corruptly enriched themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the former Ombudsman, Augustine Ruzindana, who is now a member of the legislature, he had intercepted several cheques amounting to billions of shillings, which were supposed to pay for what is jokingly termed as &quot;air supply&quot; or imaginary items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The powerful Parliamentary Accounts Committee has also unearthed cases of misappropriation and embezzlement of public funds and some of the culprits have gone to jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking advantage of liberal press laws, the media has also exposed corruption and abuse of power. A weekly, Uganda Confidential, specializes in publishing corruption scandals involving top leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, according to the Speaker of parliament, James Wapakhabulo, the election of an inspector general of government and the revival of the Parliamentary Accounts Committee were steps in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said at a recent anti-corruption seminar that the long-term solution lay in the modernization of society, to enable people know their rights and &quot;stop glorifying thieves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the director of special projects in Museveni's office, Amos Twinomujuni, said: &quot;We must start from the top. That is how the small fish at the bottom can fear. The moment you keep quiet, then if I have access to corruption, I will double my efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Uganda government has been at pains in its efforts to deal with corruption. In November 1996, it even signed a contract with the Swiss Procurement Company, which is expected to plug the existing loopholes in government purchasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, according to observers in Kampala, the success of the anti-corruption drive would greatly depend on the action taken by the inspector general of government against leaders found to have made fraudulent declarations of assets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 1. INTRODUCTION As a preliminary response to today's budget, COSATU acknowledges that it has both positive and negative elements. We believe that the positive elements could have been strengthened, and the negative aspects reduced, if it had not been for rigid macro-economic targets set by government, regardless of their social consequences. Those policies having a negative bearing on the budget especially those on deficit targets, monetary policy, trade and tariffs, and exchange controls.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. DEFICIT TARGETS The effect of the targets set by GEAR are now being clearly seen. The arbitrary imposition of a 4% deficit target has serious consequences. If debt repayment is excluded, this years budget will entail considerable cutting of public spending, running into billions of Rand. This comes at a time when millions of South Africans living in poverty are not covered by a basic social security net, and when unemployment, already running at over 30% is still rising. Our limited public services in areas such as health and education, are already severely stretched. Many countries in the developed world, with advanced social security systems, are resisting deficit reduction, because of what they regard as acceptably high unemployment in their countries, which sits at a fraction of the problem we are faced with. The RDP was devised as a plan which envisaged an active, dynamic role for the state in combating these problems. In this context, a strategy which involves reducing the role of the state, and relying on the private sector to address this historical legacy, is based on questionable assumptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It is of serious concern to us that we are witnessing the running down even of the limited capacity which exists in the public sector. This is in stark contrast to the initial programme of government, which envisaged the radical transformation of that sector, the slashing of unproductive bureaucracy, and the massive expansion of the public sector in areas critical to the reconstruction process. This policy shift has less to do with the needs of the country, or sound economic planning, and more to do with pressures on us from vested local and international interests. The allocation to improve the conditions of service of public sector workers, while welcome in that it meets governments immediate obligations in terms of its agreement, is only a short term measure which doesn't form part of a coherent transformation plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. ROLLOVERS The lack of effective transformation of the public sector is linked to the question of rollovers. It is alarming to see a rollover of R14, 5 billion, over 10% of last years planned expenditure of R141 Billion (excluding interest payments). This certainly does not reflect the lack of demand in the country, especially for basic services and welfare. &quot;Capacity&quot; to spend effectively won't materialise out of thin air. The development of capacity requires an intensive programme to transform the state and appropriate policies to lever effective state spending. This in turn requires the deployment of more, not fewer resources. Cutting back of the public sector and voluntary severance packages, do not constitute a programme of transformation. Taken alone, they result in the running down off the public sector, and further erosion of its capacity to deliver. Talk of reprioritisation in this context is hollow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, state spending policies which rely on private sector delivery will continue to see the inability of government to spend effectively. One clear example of this is housing policy, where a fraction of what government should be spending to achieve the 1 million housing target, is actually getting to people. An effective public housing programme however, would require a major expansion in housing funds. Lack of effective transformation programmes, and inappropriate policies should be targeted therefore.  Rollovers should not be used as an excuse to cut spending, thereby worsening the problem even further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. PROVINCES The introduction of fiscal federalism is supposed to allow for greater decentralisation, flexibility and transparency. However, the block allocations to provinces (comprising nearly 70% of non-interest expenditure) don't allow for a disaggregation of the various budget items. That is taxpayers in Gauteng are not able to see how much of their tax is being spent say on Health, when compared to the Western Cape. More importantly, central government is unable to implement national priorities when it comes to provincial spending. An unaccountable or incompetent provincial government could therefore neglect basic services without central government being able to intervene. Government should take a political decision, as it has with housing to institute national direction of other basic services. Further, there needs to be mechanisms for effective tracking and co-ordination of spending in the Provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. JOB CREATION COSATU has set job creation as one of two key components against which the success of the budget and general economic policy is to be measured. The budget speech fails this test dismally. In his economic overview, the Minister of Finance admits that job creation lags behind the targets set in GEAR. No statistical information is provided on whether sustainable jobs have been created at all. This in itself, is a serious admission that the GEAR economic measures have not had the desired anticipated effect on job creation, something which COSATU has long warned about. In a country with such serious levels of unemployment, it problematic to pursue policies which do not enable government to deliver on the key priority of the Reconstruction and Development Programme. There has been GDP growth of about 3,1%, but this growth has largely been jobless. This is worrying in the light of the Minister's additional statements concerning gross fixed investment. He states this has increased by 10% in 1995 and 7% in 1996 - yet there has been little accompanying job creation in both years. We reiterate our call for a massive housing and public works programme which has the potential of creating up to 500 000 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. ANTI-POVERTY MEASURES The increase in Old Age Pensions in line with inflation, or slightly higher, is welcome insofar as millions of poverty stricken South Africans rely on this as their major source of income. However, this is of limited comfort, for two reasons: firstly because the increase is off a very low base; and secondly because it only acts as a net for those who have pensioners in their family. It is anomalous that in a country with massive poverty, mainly concentrated in the youth who are the overwhelming majority, the only meaningful form of public income transfers is the old age pension. We would have hoped that, in the absence of a dole system to support the unemployed, a general grant aimed at families falling below a specified income level, would be introduced. The budget only contains a vague reference to a poverty relief programme, the details of which are not specified. This is disturbing in the light of the absence of a meaningful public works programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. TAXATION The fact that VAT is not increased, nor zero-rating removed, despite pressure from business, is welcome. However, COSATU would like to have seen the extension of zero-rating to basic goods, including paraffin, and basic services such as water; and the introduction of a higher VAT on luxury goods. Tax relief for those earning under R 60 000 is welcome. COSATU will still press for the top marginal rate to be moved to a super-rich category from the present R 100 000, and for the implementation of a Capital Gains tax. We also believe that last years halving of STC , and the reduction of Company Tax several years ago has created a situation where the large corporations are not paying their fair share of tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. EXPENDITURE A more detailed analysis, including provincial breakdowns needs to be done before making an informed comment. However, preliminary analysis, suggests that some, but not all areas of social spending have increased. Where this has happened it is obviously welcome. On average, social spending is however slightly down as a percentage of GDP. We welcome the decision to increase spending on policing, and to reduce defence expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. PRIVATISATION We would like to know where the proceeds of privatisation and the Strategic Equity Partner agreements are being allocated, something the budget is silent on. COSATU believes that it would be inappropriate to allocate the proceeds to debt, as advocated by business, as this would be tantamount to selling off the family silver, by paying a fraction of the interest on our debts. Rather, we believe it should be reinvested in capital projects to strengthen our infrastructure and the delivery of basic services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11 EXCHANGE CONTROL COSATU records its disappointment that government appears to have yielded to business pressure to further liberalise exchange controls. We have repeatedly warned that such stops may lead to huge outflows of domestic capital, put pressure on interest rates and hamper domestic product, fixed investment and hence development and job creation. Steps to counter capital flight have not been made clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional worries include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the open-endedness, discretionary nature of the moneys involved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the effect of industrial relocation to Southern Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. SUPPLY SIDE MEASURES The allocation to supply-side measures remain inadequate, in the light of accelerated tariff reforms. Even though there is an indication of a 33% increase, to R604,6 million for 1997/98, it must be remembered this is off a low, first time base allocation of R454 million in 1996/97. Tariff reduction commenced as early as 1994, with absolutely no supply-side measures for almost two years since its commencement. Tariff reductions are also accelerated at a greater rate than required by GATT (now WTO). It is wrong to assume than an amount of R604,60 million, spread over all affected sectors of the economy, is enough to bring about meaningful investment in supply-side measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more worrying, is governments intention to accelerate tariff reductions further (to take advantage of the depreciating effects of the Rand) . Labour has over many years consistently called for investment in supply- side measures to effectively restructure our industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13 PROCESS In our understanding multi year budgeting will be introduced for the 1998- 2 000 budgets. This is welcome insofar as it allows for a far more coherent and integrated process of planning. To be effective, however, this process will have to be inclusive, unlike previous budgets. This process needs to be expedited in parliament through the White Paper, and relevant legislation, as well as through effective consultations in NEDLAC, and other forums.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A plot against Burundi leader Pierre Buyoya - possibly planned by hard-line Tutsi military officers - appears to have been thwarted. Burundian state radio today announced that two military officers and four civilians have been arrested, charged with attempting to assasinate or overthrow the regime of Pierre Buyoya. It is not immediately clear when the arrests were made. Interior Minister Epitace Bayaganakandi said on state radio that the government &quot;is in total control of the situation&quot;, and that an investigation was under way. Army spokesman Isaie Nibizi said that among the arrested people were a deserter of the Rwandan Patriotic Army and an executive committee member of PARENA, reports AFP. PARENA is the party of former president Jean Baptise Bagaza, who had until recently under house arrest in Bujumbura since mid-January. AFP today quoted an anonymous military source as saying that the planned &quot;coup&quot; was backed by officers in four military camps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three anti-tank landmines exploded in Bujumbura last night. Initial reports indicate at least four people were killed and two wounded when vehicles ran over the mines, hidden in potholes or on dirt roads. One went off outside a military base in central Bujumbura. The second explosion took place in Rohero II, a residential area. The third mine blew up in Kwijabe area. Some exchanges of fire were reported by local sources on the outskirts of town last night. A heavy military presence was reported around the town this morning. Mines have not recently been reported inside Bujumbura. No group has taken responsibility for the mines, and AFP reports Buyoya's spokeman, Jean- Luc Ndizeye, saying &quot;I doubt the Hutu rebels are capable of laying mines in Bujumbura&quot;. The most serious recent insecurity in Bujumbura, resulting in at least seven deaths, occurred in Kamenge district during the night of February 24, report UN sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) claims it has taken control of Kongolo, situated on the Zaire river and the Lubumbashi-Kindu railway line about 150 km west of Kalemie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting continues on the road to Bafwasende. But in Kinshasa, Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo yesterday vowed to defend Kisangani. The Zairean defence ministry yesterday said it was &quot;in control of the situation&quot;, and that rebels were no closer than 40 kilometres of Kisangani. Kengo claimed that &quot;Kabila has won battles, but he has not won the war&quot;, reports Reuters.  Zairean military authorities have sent reinforcements to Mbuji-Mayi and Lubao in Kasai, according to AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Refugees amassed at Ubundu are crossing the river from east to west in large numbers. Humanitarian sources indicate anywhere between 200 to 1,000 per hour are crossing the river and heading towards a new site, known only as Kilometre 95, 25 km north of Ubundu town on the west of the river. The Federation has taken up responsibility for some camp services, including establishing a field hospital and running distributions with Red Cross volunteers. About 75,000 Rwandan refugees, mainly from Tingi-Tingi have arrived at Ubundu so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French Secretariat for Humanitarian Action Emergency Cell has sent the second of a planned three flights to Kisangani today with relief supplies for the refugees in Ubundu. A later flight will include a Zodiac boat for use in operations around Ubundu. Xavier Emmanuelli, French Secretary of State for Humanitarian Action, was quoted yesterday by AFP as saying &quot;whole populations cannot be allowed to disappear under the pretext that they are in the way&quot;.  France continues to urge an international humanitarian operation to relieve the plight of the refugees, but the US State Department has said it sees little &quot;useful purpose&quot; in attempting another military intervention and that intends to concentrate on promoting the ceasefire and helping the refugees.  An EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels today is also expected to tackle the Zaire issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New logistics routes have been established by WFP to supply refugees in Ubundu and displaced people in Kisangani. The first IL-76 flight from Mwanza, Tanzania to the smaller municipal Kisangani airstrip carrying 30 tons of food succeeded today. This airstrip is better located, less militarized and more secure for relief supplies than the main airport outside the town. From Kisangani, delivery can be made by rail to Ubundu along the western side of the river. UNICEF has also used the rail route to deliver nutritional biscuits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French NGO Action Contre la Faim has accused the international community of &quot;totally abandoning hundreds of thousands of refugees&quot; in eastern Zaire. In a statement issued yesterday, ACF said it the international community &quot;seems to be dealing with the problem by letting them (the refugees) die.&quot; ACF also criticized both sides in the war, the rebels for denying access to populations in need, and Serbian mercenaries for threatening humanitarian teams on the Zairean government side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures from UNHCR Kigali indicate that an average of 220 &quot;new caseload&quot; refugees returned to Rwanda every day in the first week of March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The state-run Kenya Times reports that authorities have &quot;smashed&quot; a &quot; racket&quot; in which &quot;hundreds of foreigners&quot; found their way illegally into Kenya. The report said that the Kenyan Immigration Department had cracked down on the practice, and that as well as Rwandans fleeing Zaire, Somalis had also been involved in similar schemes. Four Somalis were convicted yesterday of illegally entering Kenya and sentenced to a year in prison or a 40,000 Ksh fine, followed by deportation. See also IRIN Update 109 for background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Pabbo (total population about 30,000), a &quot;protected village&quot; 20 kilometres from Gulu in northern Uganda was attacked by rebels thought to be members of the Lord's Resistance Army, according to AFP. Eight people were reported killed, including two children. Up to 280,000 people are grouped into protected villages in northern Uganda, a figure which includes the resident populations of those settlements, in addition to displaced people.  The settlements are defended by the Ugandan People's Defence Forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAU/UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes, Mohamed Sahnoun met with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in Gulu yesterday, according to the state- owned New Vision newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rwanda has again expressed scepticism about a proposed Great Lakes international conference, the idea of which has been supported most recently by the UN Security Council. Justice Minister Faustin Nteziryayo, speaking in Geneva at the UN Commission for Human Rights, said &quot;we must not mix up the issues&quot;. He also accused Kenya of failing to extradite suspects in the 1994 genocide, and the International Criminal Trinubal for Rwanda of ineffectiveness, reports AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* AFP reports that Rwandan authorities have given permission for Spanish police to go to Rwanda to investigate the deaths of three Spanish aid workers with Medecins du Monde in Ruhengeri in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The total number of refugees in Tanzania is about 359,000. In addition to the 254,000 described in Kigoma region in IRIN Update 125, there are also about 105,000 in the Ngara region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Reports in the Uganda's Government-owned New Vision newspaper claim that the SPLA have captured Morobo, described as a strategic garrison town 13 kms north of Zaire's border with Sudan, along with a smaller garrison town at Tamala. The report says that Morobo and Tamala fell in the early hours of Wednesday morning after fighting between the SPLA and Sudanese Government troops, backed by West Nile Bank Front rebels. The Sudanese troops are reported to have retreated towards Yei, a garrison town further north which remains under Sudanese Government control. The SPLA's offensive, which began in earnest during the weekend of 8/9 March, has reportedly resulted in the SPLA capturing several towns along Sudan's border with Uganda: Kaya, Gumuli, Kajo-Keji, Foki, Kimba and Bazi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Congress of South African Trade Union (Cosatu) has welcomed Finance Minister Trevor Manuel's maiden Budget but expressed strong reservations about some of its aspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu said in a statement that policies on deficit targets, monetary policy, trade and tariffs and exchange controls had a negative bearing on the Budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that the positive elements could have been strengthened and the negative aspects reduced if it had not been for rigid macro-economic targets set by Government, regardless of their social consequences,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of this criticism, Cosatu praised the Government's anti-poverty measures and the fact that value added tax had not been increased and that zero-rating on essentials had not been removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The increase in old age pensions in line with inflation, or slightly higher, is welcome insofar as millions of poverty-stricken South Africans rely on this as their major source of income,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federation reserved its strongest criticism of the Budget for its lack emphasis on job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cosatu has set job creation as one of two key components against which the success of the Budget and general economic policy is to be measured. The Budget speech fails this test dismally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partial removal of exchange controls also raised the federations ire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have repeatedly warned that such steps may lead to huge outflows of capital, put pressure on interest rates and hamper domestic products, fixed investment and hence development and job creation,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Pretoria yesterday at a National Union of Mineworkers congress, Cosatu secretary-general Sam Shilowa criticised the Budget for being confined to the the Government's strategy for growth, employment and redistribution (GEAR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said GEAR's policy on labour market flexibility would mean a restraint of workers' wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEAR aims to have the economy growing at a six percent rate by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political democracy and transformation can only succeed if it is linked to a programme to eliminate poverty, create jobs, pay a living wage, transform the public service and invest in human capital,&quot; Mr Shilowa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For us to co-operate with big business, international finance and the Government in implementing GEAR is like being told to dig our own graves - jump in voluntarily and then wait to have the earth thrown on top of us by the representatives of those interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre, which will cost about R220-million, is definitely on the cards after provincial Planning Minister Lampie Fick facilitated the formation of a Foreshore development task team.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre has been described as a &quot;loss leader&quot; which will require public sector funding, but will generate millions of rands for the Western Cape economy and create one job for every seven visitors attracted by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All parties have agreed that the project should get off the ground as quickly as possible if the Western Cape is to get a slice of the industry which generates worldwide $300-billion (R1 320-bn) turnover a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreed site is bounded by the Heerengracht, Coen Steytler Avenue and the elevated Table Bay Boulevard and is deemed ideal</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The city's celebration of its success in the Olympic shortlist race has earned the city front page exposure in the influential global newspaper, the International Herald Tribune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Happy South African faces in the cheering crowd at the Waterfront on Friday after the announcement of Cape Town's inclusion in the shortlist of five cities vying to host the 2004 Games, formed the cheerful front page centrepiece of the Saturday/Sunday Zurich edition of a publication that is regarded as &quot;the world's daily newspaper&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a reflection of the remarkable capacity of the bid to project the city into the boardrooms and livingrooms of the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key element of the developmental and economic capacity of the bidding phase, as much as actually winning the bid, is the invaluable international exposure it provides for the city and the country as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is particularly significant in view of the fact that tourism is the region's fastest growing industry and the sector of the economy that generates jobs faster than any other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The predominant focus of the report accompanying the photograph was South Africa's achievement in gaining its shortlist ranking and the challenges that lie ahead if Cape Town is to succeed in hosting the 2004 Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True to present international perceptions, the report highlights the issues of crime and the relative lack of infrastructure as the key matters to address in the next six months of lobbying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Herald Tribune report also reflects the curiously discriminating view that after having been &quot;away&quot; for two Games - Atlanta last year and Sydney in 2000 - the event could logically, as the argument goes, return &quot;home&quot; to Europe in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in Europe tend to discount Cape Town's organisational ability, not only in the exacting business of actually staging the Games, but also in the complex, subtle art of lobbying the International Olympic Committee, the task that will dominate the bidding agenda to September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Europe's tendency to underestimate South Africa in this respect might ultimately count in Cape Town's favour.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Metaphors and symbolism abound when Melanie Reinhart speaks about her life, our lives and the bigger picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melanie is a respected astrologer based in London and author of two books.  She's visiting Cape Town to present seminars, give talks and see her godmother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's also reconnecting with her southern Africa roots. We speak about the millennium, astrology and the threads which weave her life together.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melanie has written a book about Chiron, a small (in cosmic terms) body between Saturn and Uranus detected by astronomers in1977. Between 1992 and 1995, astronomers went on to discover five other smaller &quot;centaurs&quot;, and Melanie's second book To the Edge and Beyond (CPA Press, 1996) looks at new research on Chiron and the orbits of centaurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiron, she says, is a symbol for our time: half horse, half man, it signifies the reconciliation of opposites. In Greek mythology Chiron is the wounded healer, a demi-god stuck between two worlds. We're in a time of transition, says Melanie, a time to create new pathways, a time of change and healing on all levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's happening everywhere,&quot; says Melanie. &quot;Our old systems are not working, our dualistic way of thinking is not working. We can see this in healing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last decades have seen a huge increase in the availability of different healing techniques. Knowledge has changed. Scientific materialism has now rounded out and is complemented by complementary medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's not an either or situation. We need a synthesis of both. Healing happens through divine grace, whether that comes through a scalpel or not.  What we are seeing now is the spiritual element that's behind all healing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melanie was born in Zimbabwe and her interest in astrology began when, as a 10-year-old child, she broke an arm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took a long time to heal and she spent a lot of time out of school. Her refuge was the local library where she found one small book on astrology. &quot;I read it avidly. It was like a rediscovery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being a time of sanctions, there was nothing much available in Zimbabwe and her interest lay latent until, as a student, a friend gave her a book on astrology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a peak experience. I realised astrology was what I wanted to study.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After competing her degree, Melanie took the boat to England where she joined a Sufi community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life has a way of making you face what you most fear, and Melanie was no exception: she was scared of the dark and scared of cows and her first job was milking duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately fear turned to passion and she grew to love the cows. In the community she dug potatoes, ran the kitchens, catered for 20 to 50 people and did some gardening. She also learned about human nature. &quot;My learning took place watching what happened in a unique, pressured life-situation. I also learned about my rigidity in the face of change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Precious leisure time was taken up studying astrology, which she taught herself, only formalising her study years later. She now teaches at two centres in London, which she loves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been in astrology for almost 22 years, but I started in a different place from what students do today,&quot; she says. &quot;Entire ways of thinking have been edited out of the western cultural mainstream, not only astrology but whole ways of thinking and understanding the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People's relationship with the heavens is such a primordial experience, our connection with celestial origins is a natural experience. It's been there since there's been consciousness to register it. Fundamentally it gives us a religious view, which is an awareness of the divine at work in life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On to the millennium. The end of the century and of the millennium is not an astrological measurement, but a function of the calendar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there's something about the millennium that produces psychological turmoil and general skin-shedding. It's the recognition of something ending.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it so happens that there are astrological alignments which coincide with this millennium which occur every 12 000 years. This area of the zodiac is said to be the gateway, the cosmic crossroads. In Celtic mythology it is the beginning point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a place of darkness. But we must let go of the particular philosophical legacy that says dark is bad. Dark is the place of potential, transformation and fertility. The moon cycle starts in the dark, two days before it is visible to us. Life starts in the womb. Sleep is going into the dark, into rest and revitalisation. It's profoundly exciting. New forms are embryonic, still waiting for birth. It's the letting go of the old and the bringing in of the new.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Finance Minister Trevor Manuel delivered his first budget in parliament yesterday to a generally favourable response from business and political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doubts which may have existed about the government's commitment to its Growth, Employment and Redistribution strategy - a strategy which has won praise from investors and from business, but which faces continuing resistance from Cosatu and others in the ruling coalition - should have been dispelled yesterday by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel's first Budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only did he meet one of the fundamental requirements of the strategy - to reduce the deficit to four percent of gross domestic product in the 1997- 1998 financial year - but he produced an investor friendly Budget which has drawn praise from business and industry at home and abroad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the general approval of Mr Manuel's proposals from other parties and from groups which have shown some reserve about the government's social and ideological agenda was one of the most remarkable and encouraging features of the Budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Manuel's ability to balance the demands of the government's political constituency for greater expenditure in many areas, from social welfare and education to housing and health care, with the demands of the investor community for greater spending on crime prevention and a relaxation of exchange control, was no mean feat. To have done so while also reducing the deficit was an impressive accomplishment indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country has been presented with a disciplined and well-balanced Budget which provides some relief to the poor and to middle class taxpayers and which has concentrated on social expenditure to the conspicuous disadvantage of traditional apartheid-era budget beneficiaries like the the military. It provides a nurturing framework for investment and growth and a sound basis on which the government can build the &quot;better future for all&quot; which it undertook to do with much fanfare in the 1994 election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - If you have a heart attack, don't come to Tygerberg Hospital - it's infested with cockroaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the warning from Chief Medical Superintendent of Tygerberg Hospital Abul Rahman who says obsolete equipment in the cardiology catheter laboratory, which sometimes stops working during critical procedures, is putting people's lives at risk. Dr Rahman was briefing the province's standing committee on health on the hospital's dire financial situation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our budget has been cut by almost 30 percent. We've stopped certain services. There's a moratorium on joint replacement and we're not taking any more dialysis patients. So many facilities have been cut to the bone. Now they're taking away the marrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital has 271 fewer beds and has 1 033 vacant posts. The R5,1- million budget for equipment was laughable, said Dr Rahman. &quot;We can only replace small equipment, like stethoscopes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anton Doubell, Professor of Cardiology at Tygerberg Hospital, said he was becoming &quot;acutely nervous&quot; for the safety of patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province had a legal responsibility to patients and should look at the implications of faulty equipment, he added. The cardiology unit performs about 1 000 catheterisation procedures a year using the two angiogram machines, which are 23 and 13 years old - their lifespan is supposed to be 10 years, with regular maintenance. The machine shows the flow of blood through the heart's arteries, indicating blockages on a screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These machines are vital to the functioning of the unit, for diagnostic and therapy purposes in an emergency,&quot; says Professor Doubell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis at the cardiology unit highlights the effect of provincial health budget cuts carried mainly by the academic hospitals of Tygerberg, Red Cross and Groote Schuur. Further cuts are expected when the Western Cape provincial cabinet allocates money for health in its 1997/98 budget next week after the Government yesterday cut the provincial budget by R780-million. Dr Rahman said Tygerberg had kept within its R417-million budget for 1996/7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital has budgeted R379,1-million for the 1997/98 financial year. &quot; Indications are that we will only be given R277-million. I have two options: I can chop 500 more beds, or chop half my staff. That's not possible.&quot; Tygerberg Hospital serves 2,5-million people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Five of South Africa's leading universities, including the University of Cape Town, have taken the controversial step of recognising gay and lesbian unions by extending full marital benefits to gay and lesbian staff members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their decision means that gay and lesbian staff - said to number &quot;several hundred&quot; at the five institutions - will be allowed to register same-sex partners for pension and medical aid benefits and will be entitled to all other benefits granted to married staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other universities involved are the University of the Witwatersrand, Fort Hare, Zululand and Rhodes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision of the universities has implications for all employers, and for insurance companies, pension schemes and medical aid societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows extensive research and debate on the provision in the new constitution which prohibits discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also follows decisions at leading universities around the world to extend full marital benefits to gay and lesbian staff and to eliminate discrimination on the basis of gender and sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's new constitution is the first in the world to prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joy Fish, the deputy registrar at UCT's Human Resources Department, said the university had taken the decision last year after receiving a number of letters from staff involved in long-term same-sex relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We recognised that we had to find a way of recognising such people (gay partners) as legitimate partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It feels right, like the type of thing UCT would want to do, and is in line with UCT culture,&quot; said Ms Fish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UCT had a provident fund in which staff could name their beneficiaries, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the university's medical aid fund, trustees would look into cases in which beneficiaries were not named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We require that they sign an affidavit that they are in a marriage-like relationship that is intended to be permanent. Having signed the affidavit, the same benefits are available as if the partner is a common-law spouse,&quot; said Ms Fish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality said the coalition believed the Labour Relations Act and the constitution required that all employee benefits were extended to same-sex partners as they would be to heterosexual couples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the coalition was conducting a survey to find which employers were extending employee benefits to same-sex partners and which were not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An actuary for Old Mutual Actuaries and Consultants, Eric Potgieter, said extending employee benefits to same-sex partners was an issue many companies had not thought about before and had not been challenged on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the new constitution, this would now change, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of companies have extended benefits to same-sex partners - it is a further step on the road to diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me it is a question of acknowledging the realities of the society we are living in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He felt it would not have a marked effect on the insurance industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot see any significant financial implications. Companies concerned about the financial implications do not have a lot to worry about,&quot; Mr Potgieter said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A &quot;terrible storm&quot; hit the Ubundu area yesterday afternoon and the Federation estimates that large numbers of Rwandan refugees caught while crossing the river may have drowned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean Red Cross volunteers were unable to help the refugees as the &quot;waves were too big&quot;. Diplomatic sources in Kisangani confirmed that a makeshift raft carrying 76 people was washed away in the river yesterday. Atlas Logistiques, a French NGO, is attempting to repair a boat which is out of action in Ubundu to help refugees cross the river. At one point near Ubundu, humanitarian sources indicate that the river is shallow enough for refugees to attempt to wade across.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic sources told IRIN that Rwandan refugees are paying as much as $2 per person to cross the Zaire river at Ubundu. Local canoe owners are ferrying refugees to the western shore of the Zaire river. As of last night, the Federation reported that around 10 canoes were taking &quot;a few hundred an hour&quot; across and 7,000 had arrived as of Friday morning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typhoid, diarrhoea, skin diseases and malaria are reported to be the most prevalent health problems amongst refugees who have so far arrived. Weaker refugees may be lagging behind, humanitarian sources say. The new refugee site on the west of the river has now moved to &quot;Kilometre 82&quot;. Plastic sheeting, Rubb-Hall storage tents and kitchen sets are on the way, a Federation spokesman told IRIN today. Red Cross volunteers are repairing the airstrip near to the refugee site with the aim of making the strip accessible to Hercules C-130 cargo planes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The death toll from landmine explosions in Bujumbura on Wednesday night has risen to seven, according to Burundi state radio. The station also reported that a reward of two million Burundian francs is being offered by the gendarmerie for information on the &quot;terrorists&quot; who planted the mines.  AFP reports military spokesman Isaie Nibizi saying &quot;we have reason to believe that the mines were planted by PARENA&quot;, but ex-president and PARENA leader Jean Baptiste Bagaza is reported to have said &quot;Bagaza's people have neither the interest nor the means to plant anti-tank mines.&quot; Nibizi also alleged, according to AFP, that PARENA was helped by the National Council for the Defence of Democracy, the banned Hutu-dominated rebel movement. The Tutsi- dominated PARENA - Parti de la Reconciliation Nationale - was formed by Bagaza in August 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Laurent Desire Kabila, leader of the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire arrived back in Goma and announced to AFP he had met with Mohamed Sahnoun, Joint OAU/UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region in Uganda on Thursday. Reuters had earlier reported on the low-key meeting in Gulu. Sahnoun arrived in Kigali, Rwanda today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel official Gaetan Kakudji, returning to Goma from Europe spoke to AFP yesterday of his meetings with French and Belgian officials and said that he detected a difference between the older and younger generations - &quot;the old guard is always going on about the Anglophone world absorbing the Francophone world. It's not our problem. They are talking about culture and keeping control of their former territories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel administration in Goma is requisitioning houses from local residents in order to accomodate members of the ADFL. In a dispatch from Goma, AFP reports that letters have been sent to a number of homeowners asking them to vacate their houses. The letters say the houses will be returned at a later date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Armed forces from Angola are being accused of fighting on both sides in the Zairean conflict. The general staff of the Zairean army alleged today that a battalion of Angolan government troops were supporting ADFL rebels. In a statement reported by AFP the FAZ claimed to have killed two Angolan officers of the Luanda government's Popular Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola on the Bafwasende front line. The Christian Science Monitor today alleged that 1,600 troops from Angola's former rebel UNITA movement are deployed to support FAZ troops in Shaba and towards Kisangani. Zaire supported UNITA during the years of civil war in Angola, which is now in a shaky transition to a government of national unity to include UNITA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An AFP photographer close to the front line 60 km from Kisangani along the Bafwasende road reported heavy fighting yesterday. AFP quotes General Numbi Kalume, the Zairean commander, saying that the rebels had lost 50 men and that their field headquarters had been destroyed. Arms and material captured by government forces included weapons of North Korean and &quot;Arab&quot; origin, the report states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retuers reports clashes between rebel forces and Zairean government troops on lake Tanganyika, with the apparent target of the rebels being Moliro, the southernmost town on Zaire's lakeshore. The Zairean defence ministry claimed that on Wednesday its &quot;naval force intercepted the enemy boats. In the clashes that ensued, 11 rebels were killed and eight captured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A joint UN/NGO mission (WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR, MSF, OXFAM and OMNIS, a local NGO) went to Tingi-Tingi and Amisi from Goma on 12 March. They found a total of about 1,700 Rwandan refugees in poor condition. The mission estimated that there are some 500 to 600 refugees in Tingi-Tingi. The refugees, most of whom show signs of serious malnutrition, claimed to have been surviving on roots and leaves collected in the dense rainforest. Many were too weak to walk over to the food distribution sites. Water is collected from a nearby pond which is believed to be unsanitary. Some refugees claim they wandered in circles in the forest before finding their way out and back to the camps. They say there are many more refugees in the forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Amisi, about 1,200 refugees have emerged out of the forest. Food aid is being transported by foot and by bicycle to the refugee site which is located some 7 km from Amisi town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 33 unaccompanied children in Tingi-Tingi and another 47 in Amisi have already been identified and UNICEF has initiated a programme to locate their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The heads of state meeting in Nairobi next week will not be a full-blown summit, the Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka announced yesterday. He said it would be a preparatory meeting for a later Nairobi III meeting. The Nairobi series of meetings has been somewhat overshadowed by South African- hosted talks between the Zairean parties and the OAU's planned summit in Lome towards the end of the month.. Nonetheless, the heads of state of South Africa, Cameroon, Zimbabwe and Kenya will attend the mini-summit, and the presidents of Zaire, Congo and Tanzania have also been invited, KTN TV reported yesterday. Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, widely believed to have been involved in brokering contacts between the rebels and Zairean government in Cape Town earlier this month, has not been invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Zaire, Roberto Garreton, has requested approval from the Zairean government for a visit to eastern Zaire to investigate allegations of &quot;extremely grave human rights violations&quot; in the area. In a statement from Geneva, he also expressed the hope that ADFL rebels will permit him to visit areas under their control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In his presentation to the UN Commission on Human Rights on Thursday the Special Rapporteur on the use of mercenaries, Enrique Bernales Ballesteros, said new legislation should make the &quot;recruitment, use, financing and training of mercenaries&quot; illegal, as such activities violate human rights, sovereignty and self-determination of peoples. Referring specifically to mercenaries employed by FAZ forces in Zaire, he called for urgent steps to remove mercenaries from the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Dr Alex Boraine, vice-chairperson, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, March 13, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is concerned at the widespread confusion reflected in the media over the Commission's role in dealing with allegations about people alleged to have been informers for the government in the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe it is necessary to set the record straight by placing on record developments so far:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Monday the TRC's Amnesty Committee decided that it did not consider it appropriate for the Committee's present purposes that a former Security policeman applying for amnesty should be forced to name people whom he alleged had been police informers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday the Human Rights Violations Committee, at a regular meeting, discussed the matter thoroughly. It decided that while it may not be necessary for the work of the Amnesty Committee for the alleged informers to be named, in view of the Commission's commitment to openness an attempt should be made to ascertain their identities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Chairperson of the TRC, announced our intentions, noting the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I shall be discussing the matter fully with the Amnesty Committee. However, I do not understand that their decision necessarily precludes other sections of the Commission from conducting an investigation, at least for purposes other than those of the amnesty process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday the matter was raised by a delegation from the ANC at a meeting with the Commission in Cape Town. We informed the ANC that we had already set in motion procedures to obtain the identity of alleged informers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have written to the attorneys for the applicants whose case is before the Amnesty Committee, asking that their clients provide names or face subpoenas requiring them to do so. In terms of a recent Appeal Court decision those named would be given 21 days' notice before being asked to appear before the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is of critical importance that at every stage of this process it is kept in mind that we are dealing with allegations which will need to be corroborated before any public announcement is made. The fact that these are so far untested allegations is being largely ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also important to make it clear that the Commission does not intend to launch a large-scale sniffing out of alleged informers. We have neither the resources, the time nor the inclination to do this. Where we will have to take action is when specific evidence is placed before a hearing alleging that an informer was party to a gross violation of human rights, either before, during or after the fact. In these cases, we are bound to investigate the allegation, just as we would any other allegation of direct involvement in a gross violation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are determined not to allow this issue to become a political football.  Our handling of the matter will governed by the specific and carefully- defined objectives of the Commission laid down in an Act of Parliament.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Nigeria regained the international spotlight for its treason charge Wednesday, on 15 opponents of the military regime. Briefly, that pushed aside but did not submerge comments on the war in Zaire, and a diplomatic entente between Tripoli and the Vatican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the regime in Nigeria a Dakar newspaper, Sud Quotidien, said that once one became despotic it was impossible to shake off that behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does Sani Abacba not fit this profile?&quot; it said. &quot;We are increasingly inclined to think so, as a result of the treason charge against Wole Soyinka and 14 others.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added: &quot;By this act, it appears that the Nigerian government is paranoid, a condition that can lead to suicide.&quot; It asked whether the treason charge was not a way of using the country's judiciary &quot;to insult the international community,&quot; and all this at a time when a delegation the Human Rights Commission of the Organization of African Unity (O.A.U.) was visiting the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It concluded saying that the appearance that Nigeria was faltering was, in fact, &quot;a strategy to take advantage of the international community's failure in reaching a consensus on sanction against Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to the commission's tour, it said as those of other organizations, this occasion was being used by the regime to project a positive image of itself and prolong its rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nigerian government is talking about wanting to institute democracy yet it is doing the opposite on the ground,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, it said when the invited commission arrived in Nigeria, it had still not been authorized to meet political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this (invitation of international bodies) has been used as delaying tactics to tone down the criticism against the government following the execution of Ken Saro Wiwa, and the Abiola case,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it warned, although the government had been given room to breathe, &quot;it is obvious that such a manoeuvre cannot continue to succeed indefinitely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the westward rebel advance continues in Zaire, so do the comments of African newspapers become more intense and frequent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Addis Ababa English language daily, The Ethiopian Herald, said it was time the international community acted jointly to halt the civil war in eastern Zaire &quot;before it engulfs the rest of greater lakes region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that the war was &quot;so depressing&quot; that it appeared to be &quot;yet another vindication of the sordid assertion by the prophets of doom that Africans are inherently incapable of putting their houses in order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been other wars in Zaire, it noted but &quot;the present one may, however, top the list of human tragedies in its Bosnia/Somalia level of ferocity. Time, then, for the international community to join forces in stopping the craze.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cameroon Tribune called for immediate intervention in Zaire, for humanitarian reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporting what it said was a suggestion by United Nations Secretary- General Kofi Annan that an O.A.U peacekeeping force be sent to the country, the Tribune added: &quot;It is time the O.A.U. is provided the tools with which to make operational its Organ for Conflict Prevention and Management in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cameroonian weekly, Galaxie, said Zaire's uprising sprung from a ground swell of &quot;popular discontent, a crisis of confidence, political deadlock, economic failure and a blind dictatorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said: Laurent-Desire Kabila's alleged liberation struggle could be analyzed as part of a set of solutions to the crisis and to stop Zaire from falling apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partly in agreement with the Galaxie, the Times of Zambia said &quot;the deepening crisis&quot; had &quot;cast a dark pall&quot; over Zaire, which was already in ruin &quot;caused chiefly by gross mismanagement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the recent fighting erupted in eastern Zaire, it said, &quot;the Zairian economy was in shambles. There was virtually nothing to be salvaged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, it said, with or without war, Zairians &quot;would continue trekking across the frontiers&quot; in search of food and other basic essentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What President Mobutu Sese Seko has bequeathed to his country is a legacy which is now all too familiar in Africa: ruin and deprivation,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extrapolating from the Zaire situation to the larger African scene it said: &quot;Zaire is a symptom of a larger problem which Africa is still encumbered in, namely crass incompetence by despots reluctant to stand down, ethnic divisions and largely useless conflicts that have persisted in the post cold war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, it said: &quot;The process of democratization on the African continent will be derailed unless the remaining despots are shown the door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added: &quot;The crisis now facing Africa will never be overcome until its leaders learn to call a spade, a spade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For their part, Libyan newspapers welcomed ambassadorial level diplomatic ties Monday between Tripoli and the Vatican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Chams saw the move as another diplomatic success for Libya, coming on the heels of the Tripoli meeting of the O.A.U. Council of Ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Zahf al Akhdar, said Libya's ties with the Holy See were &quot;a clear and complete rejection of the view propagated by Washington that Libya is isolated&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE, Swaziland (PANA) - Unlike their western mates, homosexuals in Swaziland will be having it rough coming out of the closet, since government has said it will not tolerate this behavior in this traditional kingdom of some one million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Swazi Prime Minister Sibusiu Dlamini said government would not recognize the newly formed Homosexuals Association, the first of its kind in the kingdom where the King has -- wifes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Dlamini said at the news conference in Mbabane that the country lacked a law and government policy concerning homosexuals because the phenomenon was new to the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Swazi culture, he said, such sexual behavior was considered abnormal and unacceptable by the larger public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Swazis would have the opportunity, during the forthcoming constitutional review, to express their views on homosexuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until majority opinion on the issue was known, he said, Swaziland would continue to reject the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland's anti-gay stance came just days after President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said in Dublin, Ireland, that he had no apology for his persistent attacks on homosexuals in his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe's remark came on the heals of a court revelation late February that country's former non-executive president, the Reverend Canaan Banana, had committed homosexual rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existence of the new association in Mbabane, Gays and Lesbians Association of Swaziland or Galeswa, was announced in a recent statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association's president, Mangosuthu Dlamini, said its objective was to give homosexuals recognition as members of society, as Swaziland moves from a traditional to a modern democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dlamini said until now, homosexuals in the Kingdom had no voice to demand their right of choice of their sexual orientation &quot;and have been mentally and physically abused by people opposed to homosexuality.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, (PANA) - Air Zimbabwe pilots and flight engineers went on strike Friday demanding better salaries, causing flight delays, cancellations affecting hundreds of passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action, which took airline authorities by surprise, comes after months of negotiations between the pilots and management for more pay and better packages, in line with other airlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think it's total disregard of customers. I think we have inconvenienced passengers and over-stretched their patience,&quot; said acting managing director, Peter Chikumba.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Friday afternoon passengers were seen mingling in the foyer of Harare International Airport, the country's leading gateway, trying to get information about cancelled flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chikumba, while admitting the pilots and flight engineers had a genuine grievance, said their action was misjudged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told reporters he hoped that the pilots and engineers would &quot;see sense&quot; and go back to work while negotiations continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would not say how much the pilots and engineers were being paid and how much they were demanding, describing such information as a company secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flight deck crews, who were said to be &quot;resting&quot; in their crew rooms, could not be contacted for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the strike, Air Zimbabwe has had to lease aircraft from Nationwide of South Africa for its domestic and regional routes. Air Zimbabwe is hiring these aircraft for between 1,500 rand (340 U.S. dollars) and 3,000 rand (681 U.S. dollars), while passengers are being booked on Zimbabwe Express Airlines, a private carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leased aircraft are Boeing 727 with a capacity of 110 seats, two BAC- 111 with 90 seats and one HS.748 with a capacity of 30 passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the leased aircraft managed to clear passengers to Bulawayo, the country's second city, and Johannesburg in South Africa, some flights to Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls, Bulawayo and Windhoek, in Namibia, were cancelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers to the Kariba resort town were ferried by bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Friday afternoon, no alternative arrangements had been made for international flights to Frankfurt, Lanarka, in Cyprus, and London scheduled for later in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chikumba said it was too early to determine the cost of the strike to the airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on an article published Friday by the Zimbabwe Independent, that Air Zimbabwe had &quot;gone bust&quot; Chikumba, who denied ever talking to the paper, said he was worried about the newspaper's intentions. He added that the article had done a lot of damage as some concerned business partners were calling the airline to know its financial position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Air Zimbabwe is not broke, it's not bankrupt,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was aware the airline was operating in a competitive environment and there was need for it to tighten its belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe Independent, quoting Chikumba's report on the national carrier's financial situation, said the airline was bankrupt and could not meet all its obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also said the airline's poor performance meant it was unable to meet salary increments demanded by pilots, engineers and technicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Zimbabwe, with about 2,000 employees, has a fleet of nine aircraft: two Boeing 767, three Boeing 737, one Boeing 707, one BAE.146 and two Fokkers which are being phased out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The National Electoral Commission of Nigeria, or Necon, has said that 55.7 million people have registered for Saturday's local council election in Nigeria, in yet another step to returning the country to civil rule in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission Chairman Sumner Dagogo-Jack said Thursday, at a briefing in Lagos, that this figure was almost six million more than the commission had projected during the recent nationwide updating of the voters' register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dagogo-Jack said turnout for the March 10-19 voter-registration represented some 54.3 percent of the country's population, which he put at 102.5 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerians go to the polls Saturday to elect some 44,000 councilors and chairpersons from the 776 local councils in the federation of 36 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council polls are part of a series under transitional program to democracy, organized by the military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha. He has promised to hand power to an elected civilian government in October 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five parties are fielding candidates for the council polls, with balloting in the 104,000 registration/polling stations nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dagogo-Jack, whose commission is in charge of all the transition polls, said 58.8 million voter-registration cards were distributed to the 36 states and the federal capital territory, Abuja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About three million of the cards were unused, as well as at least five million copy cards intended for persons &quot;who might have lost their cards,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said all 36 states except Jigawa, Kano, and Sokoto -- all in the north, and Lagos -- registered up to 100 percent of their eligible voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributed the result in the four states to the &quot;poor turnout of women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to allegations that registration was marked by some irregularities, he said: &quot;Even these lapses do not seem to explain the fact that in almost all the states, the registered figures overshot the registerable figures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some states had complained of inadequate supply of electoral materials, but Dagogo-Jack said the result of the registration and the return of at least three million unused cards had confirmed the commission's argument that enough cards were produced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On security during Saturday's election, he said the commission had asked police and other security agencies for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as Necon is concerned, they would cover as many centers as possible, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's poll will be the first national election on a party basis since the controversial June 12, 1993 presidential elections. That election was cancelled by the military regime of the retired General, Ibrahim Babangida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annulment of that poll plunged Nigerian into a political crisis from which it is yet to recover.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerian authorities said Friday that no foreigners were being held hostage following a reported seizure of an oil barge off the coast of Warri, a town in the country's midwestern state of Delta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No oil rig or foreign nationals were involved in the incident,&quot; Chika Onwudiegwu, press secretary to Nigeria's chief of general staff, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was reacting to foreign broadcast media reports that some foreign nationals were being held hostage since Tuesday, when an oil rig was allegedly impounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A group of unemployed youths, who has been protesting marginalization by the oil industry service company, Globe Star, in its employment policy went on rampage and seized the company's barge,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the incident, he said, the barge had been released following the intervention of Nigerian security agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from Paris, France, Anith Lear, a spokesperson of the French owners of the barge, said the vessel was neither hijacked nor the workers on board held hostage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one was being kept on board against his own will,&quot; she said. &quot;No one is being kept hostage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occasional friction occurs between foreign oil companies and Nigerian communities, especially over environmental degradation or alleged development neglect of the oil-rich areas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - In what appears to be a retaliatory move, Canada has closed its High Commission in Lagos, signifying a deepening diplomatic rift between Ottawa and Abuja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high commission said Friday that while the mission &quot;is closed, Canadian consular affairs will be managed by the Embassy of the United States in Lagos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said visa services for people resident in Nigeria would now be available in Accra, Ghana. The measure came into effect Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the temporary closure, the chancery &quot;will remain open and locally- engaged consular staff will be available to provide scaled-down consular services under the supervision of the United States Embassy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A security guard was manning the entrance of the high commission's office Friday and diplomatic sources told PANA the mission's staff had all been recalled home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement did not give reason for the closure but another statement quoted the Canadian foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, as saying Wednesday the action was for fear of the safety of Canadian diplomats in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other diplomatic sources interpreted the action as a retaliation for Nigeria's decision to close its own diplomatic mission in Canada in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abuja cited economic reasons for that closure but informed sources said Ottawa's move might be a reflection of its hardened posture against Nigeria since the 1995 Commonwealth meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria was suspended from the British-led organisation following the November 1995 execution for murder of nine Nigerian minority leaders, including author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the suspension, Canada had been among the countries urging tougher actions against Abuja for alleged human rights violation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at their subsequent meetings, ministers of the Commonwealth Contact Group, would appear to have soft-pedalled, leaving Ottawa isolated on the issue of more sanctions on Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Independent Media Association (ZIMA/MISA-Zambia) reports Post newspaper editor Masautso Phiri was March 6 moved again to Lusaka Central Prison from Mwembeshi. He was moved to Mwembeshi prison March 3 to begin a three-month hard labour jail term.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phiri told ZIMA that prison authorities &quot;probably decided to keep him in Lusaka because it was easier to take him to court from Lusaka than from Mwembeshi.&quot; On March 6, Phiri, together with the paper's editor-in-chief, Fred M'membe, appeared before a Lusaka magistrate's court on defamation charges arising from a story alleging that President Frederick Chiluba had a child outside marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 17, the Supreme Court is to hear Phiri's application to review the decision jailing him for three months for contempt of court. Phiri has complained that he has not been officially notified in writing by the Supreme Court about the hearing, raising fears that prison authorities may not release him to appear in court. Phiri further complained to ZIMA that he was unable to prepare adequately for the case on March 17, in the absence of official notification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to comment, Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa told ZIMA he had nothing to do with the movement of prisoners between prisons. &quot;Once a prisoner has been jailed, he can be transferred anywhere in Zambia at the discretion of the Commissioner of Prisons, it is entirely up to the commissioner of prisons,&quot; he said. Sampa said he would &quot;investigate the matter and if he finds there was something abnormal about the transfers he would act&quot;.</SPAN></P>

The province encompasses three major tribes. People of one of the tribes, the Lubale, are now demanding that one of the towns in which they are dominant be renamed Luvaleland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the Central Province, another tribal conflict is brewing. There the Lenje people are demanding that their language be taught in schools in their area, rather than Tonga, which is the most widely spoken language in the province.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIV-Positive Zambian Doctor Stirs Local Concerns: The sacking of an HIV- positive Zambian junior doctor in England is stirring up concern among Zambians who now wonder if local medical staff treating them are subjected to an AIDS test before being allowed to handle patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern has been expressed in the press that the case of Dr Patrick Ngosa should hi-light how cautious Zambians must be when being treated by any medical worker, especially those who could accidentally contract the virus and pass it on to a patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another MP Dies As Political Parties Reconsider Boycotting By-Elections: A fourth member of parliament has died in as many months since the November 18 elections. Mwembeshi MP, Yonah Shimonde, who had been ill for some time, died in Lusaka. His death means a by-election has to be held within 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other parliamentary by-elections are yet to be held. They too follow the deaths of incumbent MPs. One by-election has already been held in which the ruling MMD retained the Itezhi Tezhi seat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the National Party says that it will be participating in by- elections because politics in Africa have proved that one does not win by boycotting elections. The Zambia Democratic Congress is also reconsidering its stance of boycotting by-elections, a position taken after being thoroughly beaten in the November 1996 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political Attention Shifts To Court: Zambia's political attention will, in the coming week, shift to the Supreme Court in Lusaka where the case of a petition against President Chiluba's legibility for presidency comes up in court. All the major political parties are among the petitioners who contend that President Chiluba might not be a born Zambian and therefore is disqualified from being a president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioners have lined up 53 witnesses, including Luka Kafupi Chabala, the man who claims to be the father of President Chiluba. Chabala has since left the public eye and is believed to be under the protection of the petitioners, because he is a key witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students Stranded After Closure Of University: Hundreds of University of Zambia (UNZA) students were left, stranded and angry, after the institution's administration decided to close it for fear of student unrest becoming more violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the approximately 4,000 students at the university in Lusaka had gone on a class boycott to demand for payment of their book allowances. The book allowances range between K150,000 and K280,000 (about US$170 and US$260).  The university then announced that the institution was closed and every student should leave the campus that same day. Medical students and post- graduates were exempted from the forced vacation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The university hired some buses to ferry the students to the inter-city bus station. However, the unexpected closure caught many students unawares, and many were forced, under police supervision, to immediately leave the campus whether or not they had sufficient funds for their transport fares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambians Now Press For Sacking Of Soccer Coach: Despite having a clean slate with no defeats since taking over the reigns of coaching the national soccer team, fans seem unimpressed by coach Fred Mwila and want him out. The fans are particularly angered that Zambia could not beat Mauritius in an African Cup qualifying match, only managing a draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure on Mwila is also said to be coming from some players who feel that his coaching techniques are out-dated and were doing more harm than good to the players and the team. He is also being accused of favouritism in selection of players.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The civil disorder that has broken out in Albania following a botched get-rich-quick scheme has compelled Zambian authorities to ban any such scheme in Zambia. It has been discovered, however, that the scheme, which promises handsome profits to those who participate in it, is still operating underground.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not many Zambians are aware of the direct cause of the conflict in Albania and regard that country as a distant problem, but the Central Bank of Zambia has taken note of the Albanian issue and has warned that it is illegal to run any such scheme in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. SHORTAGE OF LECTURERS WORSENS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quality of graduates coming out of Government-run trades training institutes in Zambia is predicted to fall because of an acute shortage of lecturers. The government needs almost 400 lecturers to fill vacancies and lift the standard of graduates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some institutes, students are unable to go through the set syllabus because of the shortage, and it is now feared that this will result in &quot;half- baked&quot; graduates. Chairman of the Teaching Service Commission, Shenge Kapini, hopes that more Zambians will take up the challenge of joining the teaching profession as college lecturers. Poor conditions of service, however, discourage potential lecturers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The privatisation giant mining conglomerate, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines(ZCCM), has begun causing shivers of concern among some Zambians who fear that disposing of the firm will amount to selling the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZCCM is Zambia's major foreign income earner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fear is that virtually all divisions of the conglomerate will be taken over by foreign companies who will be under no obligation to reinvest their profits in the mines or in any other part of Zambia. In Zambia, some potentially viable companies have collapsed since being privatised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Finance Minister Ronald Penza has said that the fears are unfounded and that in most of the divisions of the firm, the new owners would will need to inject a lot of investment to get or keep the mines running.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A couple of weeks before March 8, the international women's day, several women were angered by some letters published in local newspapers. The authors of the letters were men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They charged that women could, and would never, capably take supreme authority over men. The authors argued that women, especially those in Zambia, will always have to depend on men to succeed in whatever goals they hoped to achieve. The chain reaction that followed saw some men agreeing with the argument while many women regarded this as one of the major reasons why women were perpetually down-trodden. On March 8, the argument grew more intense as some women turned against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that day, thousands of women in various parts of the country organised marches to commemorate the day with general calls for equal opportunities.  Many of them cast aside their political differences and walked side-by-side in the quest to talk with one voice to prove that what women were demanding went beyond the artificial barriers of politics. In Lusaka, the march was crowned by a speech by Nakatindi Wina, the chairperson of the women's affairs committee in the ruling MMD party. She said the occasion was important to remind people of the continued fight by women for equal rights, international peace and social progress. Some women also called on government to declare the day an annual national holiday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, not all women saw the need to mark the occasion by marching on the streets or to be addressed by some dignitary or other. Thousands of other women were either ignorant of the occasion or chose to ignore it by going about their daily business. These included street venders, women who crush stones on road sides and women who do the cooking in makeshift restaurants.  So it could be said that the women taking part in the marches were the more enlightened ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, among the enlightened women who chose to keep away from the occasion was Zambia's only woman cabinet minister, Edith Nawakwi. She chose to spend the day working on a farm. Nawakwi, who is Agriculture, Food and Fisheries minister, condemned the tendency of women to mark women's day by marching on the streets rather than working. She contends that &quot;Zambia lags behind in development because of such attitudes, by not finding a positive manner in which to mark the day.&quot; Nawakwi was a guest at a Field Day organised by 65 women engaged in agriculture production who chose to celebrate the day by demonstrating what they were capable of achieving in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nawakwi's condemnation of the march drew a sharp reaction from Wina and other women. Wina referred to on Nawakwi's remarks as &quot;indiscipline&quot; and said she would table the issue before a national executive committee meeting of the MMD, to which both belong. But, Nawakwi's remarks also drew support from other women, who said that she was right in calling for a new perspective by women in commemorating their day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such bitter differences among Zambian women are not new. In 1995, Zambian women were split on similar lines when they differed over how to present their case and on who was to lead their delegation to the Beijing Women's Conference. Zambia ended up having two delegations, each travelling separately with its own agenda. Against this background, and two years on, the one point all women seem to agree on is that the status of women has not improved. As Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) committee secretary Judith Chomba said, poverty and unemployment have risen while economic and political power is still concentrated among men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 150-seat Zambian parliament has only 13 women, with Nawakwi the only minister. And, although virtually all political parties proclaim in their manifestos that they would strive to enhance the status of the woman, this is not reflected in practical terms. In last November's parliamentary elections, the MMD fielded no more than 20 female candidates. The highest figure was fielded by the Zambia Democratic Congress with 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many women, however, political positions are not the issue. All they care about is being able to raise enough money to buy food for their children and to send them to school. It is the inability of some of their husbands to support their respective families, that has forced many of them into such jobs as stone-crushing and the street vending of foods. And, despite AIDS and the renewed efforts of the police to curb prostitution, for some women, this has become the solution to their money needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Minister of Health, Professor Nkandu Luo, believes that despite the harsh economic climate, women could still find a &quot;decent&quot; way in which to earn a living, and that women should be seen to be helping their fellow women.  Professor Luo, Zambia's first female professor of medicine, is a founder of a prostitute's rehabilitation centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisations like the Women's Lobby Group, contend that one of the solutions for inequality is ensuring that girls are given the best of opportunities and incentives for being in school. Girls' pass marks in government schools are lower than those of boys, as a deliberate government policy to ensure that more girls advance in school and eventually get into college or university. Some principals of privately-owned schools, however, argue that setting lower pass marks for girls could eventually work against the same people in the future because they would be advancing through the stages without being fully prepared for an independent and competitive life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, however, argue that more should be done for the female pupil saying that government should also protect girls from early marriage. In rural areas, many girls are married before the age of 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For women like Cecilia Makota, however, the solution lies in farming. She notes that most women in the rural areas of Zambia are already engaged in farming and that this is what should be enhanced to improve their status. She contends that mere talk or &quot;walking the street in marches&quot; would not draw the support and sympathy of the government. Ms Makota, a successful farmer and business woman, says that if women are seen to be making personal efforts to succeed, government or foreign support would be easier to source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cultural barriers have also been identified as a major drawback in efforts to enhance the status of the Zambian women. In virtually all Zambian tribes, the woman must be submissive to the man. This often means that the woman does not have much, if any, say on issues like the number of children a couple is to have. Organisations like the Planned Parenthood Association of Zambia (PPAZ) has been lobbying government to pass a law that would limit a couple's number of children to four. The effort has so far drawn a minimal response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian women have evidently identified areas they would like to tackle in an effort to bridge the gap between themselves and the men. In some cases they have also offered steps that could be taken in getting solutions. In many cases, however, implementation of the proposals has been slow. And now, given what could be seen as this problem of differences amongst themselves, some men could just take advantage and reiterate that women will always need the guidance of men to achieve any goal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - A prosecution witness yesterday told the Federal High Court that he was an American diplomat suffering from an agonizing torture in Derg jail commonly known by the name &quot;Bermuda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness said Mr. Timothy Wilson was jailed for allegedly being a member of the Central Investigation Agency (CIA) and for supplying brochures to members of the &quot;Ethiopian People Democratic Unity&quot;, an opposition group fighting the junta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness said there was a communication break down between the diplomat and the young police investigators due to language barrier. The American was tied up and beaten turned up side down, the witness said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 164th prosecution witness said the prisoner was also investigated by foreigners whom he thought to be nationals of the then East Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ethiopia violates international laws&quot;, I heard him shouting said the witness. he showed the damage he sustained during tortures to the expatriate investigators, the witness added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four prosecution witnesses who gave evidence to the Federal High Court including the 164th, said they have suffered a great deal in 1984 in different jails but the misery they have passed through in the &quot;Bermuda&quot; was the worst of all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness said they were arrested and their houses searched without arrest or search warrant. No one of them appeared before the court of law, the witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The torture induced mental stress and pain in their hands and back are the living legacies of the Derg jails, the witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witnesses named eight inmates who they said have not returned to their cells after they were called out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also heard testimonies of three prosecution witnesses who said they have learnt the death of their husbands following the demise of the Derg without any hint about their whereabouts for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the women said after her husband was taken to Addis Ababa Prison from Gondar, Major Melaku told her &quot;not to bother about him as he was imprisoned for his misdeeds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that she was frequently taken to the office of Major Melaku where she was intimated by pistol and insulted. She said she was forced to move to some other place though it was not to her liking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - A management consultant noted here yesterday that the Region 14 Finance Bureau should take corrective measures to rectify some serious administrative bottle-nackes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking a day-long seminar aimed at improving the quality service rendered by the bureau to the tax paying public, Ato Ashebir Aberra, managing Director of Alpha-Omega Consults International, said that the finance bureau had to take a series of measures so as to put things in the right working order.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that the tax-payer should also be treated with due respect and quality service should be the motto of the bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Ashebir pointed out that the finance bureau has to maximize efficiency by improving performance, accepting new working techniques, ensuring greater motivation, increasing more internal cooperation and integration. &quot;Such and other measures can be put into effect by embracing positive thinking and open- minded approach,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consultant indicated that the finance bureau has a number of weaknesses including absolute rules and regulations, inefficient filing and documentation systems, lack of grievance reception, procrastination in decision making and absence of sufficient and up-to-date office equipment such as computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Ashebir suggested such corrective measures as implementing laws and regulations timely and judiciously, devising ways of up-grading human resource development, improving incentives, working out mechanism for curbing corruption and nepotism, and creating harmony with the tax-payer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another speaker Dr. Minas Hiruy dwelt at length on the significance of administrative ethics which he said was vital for organisational strength and efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the head of the Region 14 Finance Bureau, Woizero Genet Aberra, said earlier that the seminar would help identify problems of tax collection service and overcome them duly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 900 participants part in the seminar drawn from the regional, zonal and woreda finance bureaux.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) has appealed to donors for emergency food aid in bid to mitigate food and water scarcity that has surfaced in the Somali Regional State, in Bale and Borena zones of Oromia and south Omo Zone in southern Regional State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement it issued yesterday the public relations office said ambassadors and representatives of donor countries and welfare organizations were briefed on measures so far taken address the natural disaster in those area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call was made as the relief aid dispatched to the area was insufficient to address existing problems owing the to extent of the natural disaster in the drought affected areas, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission said so far it has dispatched relief food, water tanked trucks, tankers, twenty heavy duty trucks in addition to financial assistance in a move to alleviate the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A team had been deployed to the area to study the magnitude of the problem particularly shortage of water, it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Three countries (Togo, Ghana and Burkina Faso) have reached the epidemic threshold since the beginning of the 1997 meningitis season in early November 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togo was the first country to report an increased number of meningitis cases in the Savanes Region neighbouring Burkina Faso.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first cases were reported in late December 1996 and the epidemic threshold was reached on 5 January 1997 in Tone District. Mass immunization activities have covered 159 000 persons (100% of the population) in the Tandjouare and Oti areas neighbouring Tone District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other areas, efforts are being made to convince the population still reluctant towards vaccination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burkina Faso: The epidemic threshold has been reached in 5 districts since the second week of 1997. The weekly reported number of cases continued to increase; the epidemic has extended to more than 10 districts and continues to spread. Intensive vaccination campaigns are under way, as well as social mobilization to convince more people to be vaccinated in the affected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana: Cases have been reported from northern Ghana since the beginning of November 1996. The threshold was reached during the last week of January.  Since then, the epidemic has continued to spread. The weekly attack rates are over 15 per 100 000 population in 6 districts in the Upper East and Northern Regions. The population at greatest risk is estimated at more than 1.7 million. The national crisis committee monitors the epidemic situation and determines the needs. Intensive vaccination campaigns are in progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other countries (in the region) have reported sporadic cases. National health authorities have been re- quested to reinforce disease surveillance and initiate vaccination activities as soon as the epidemic threshold is reached.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report No. 26 Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, March 14, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South Kivu, Zaire, and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire, more than 200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995 as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe) targeted the Banyarwanda in an apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control. In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South Kivu began to resemble that of the Masisi region, as government-sanctioned harassment of Banyamulenge Tutsis intensified. On October 14, fighting broke out between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near Runingo refugee camp, in South Kivu, forcing the roughly 220,000 refugees to flee. The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance), led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from Uvira to Bukavu, and south from Rutshuru (North Kivu) to Goma. As a result of shelling October 26 and November 1, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kibumba, Katale, and Kahindo camps, near Goma, fled south to Mugunga camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Hutu attacks from Mugunga camp on Goma town, the Alliance counter-attacked from the east on November 14, forcing the ex-FAR and Interahamwe to retreat west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to return to Rwanda, while others fled north and west into Zaire. During the last four months, the Alliance has continued its advances in Eastern Zaire, most recently capturing the towns of Manono and Moba in the south, and Lubutu and Tingi-Tingi camp in the north. It controls an area about 1,280 km long, and has driven as deep as 400 km westward into Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Humanitarian Assistance for Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 (to date): $124,747, 922</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected Rwandan refugees: From November through December 1996, 1, 033,405 Rwandan refugees returned from Eastern Zaire and Tanzania to Rwanda, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  Another 232,000 Rwandans reportedly have returned from Eastern Zaire and Tanzania this year. The UNHCR claims there are up to 376,590 Rwandans stranded in Eastern Zaire, including at least 160,000 who fled on March 1 from Tingi-Tingi to Ubundu. About 75,000 are in Ubundu and others are believed to be hiding in the forests. Approximately 600 have reappeared in Tingi-Tingi, too weak to move onward. About 125,000 others dispersed in smaller groups in South Kivu and Maniema provinces, including 25,000 to 40, 000 refugees believed to be between Shabunda, Kalima, and Kindu. About 20,000 refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) have gathered in Punia, Maniema province, and more refugees are reportedly headed there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees: Of the 143,000 Burundian refugees originally in the Uvira area, some 64,000 refugees have returned to Burundi and about 13,500 have arrived in Tanzania. The UNHCR states that 39,675 refugees are missing, with many believed to be between Fizi and Kalemie, in Zaire. There are about 274,000 Burundian refugees in Tanzania, and 3,355 in Rwanda. A small number of Burundians are returning daily to Burundi from the Ngara camps in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairian refugees and internally displaced: At least 85,000 Zairians have fled to Tanzania, and in Rwanda there are 13,959 Zairians who fled the Masisi region last year. Only 4,820 Zairians remain in Uganda, down from 11,000, the UNHCR reported. Before Kindu fell to the Alliance, there were about 19,000 IDPs there. About 35,000 Zairian IDPs have gathered in Kisangani, the World Food Program (WFP) reports. To date, about 7,500 Zairian refugees have fled to Zambia, most of them arriving in Mpulungu. The Government of Sudan has appealed for UNHCR aid to assist the 10,000 Zairian refugees it reports are in the Bazi area of Western Equatoria. The number of displaced Zairians grows as the Alliance continues its advances and the FAZ retreats, looting everything in its path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alliance overran the Tingi-Tingi camps on March 1, causing the roughly 160,000 refugees to abandon the area before the rebels arrived. Alliance forces have proceeded northwest toward Kisangani, the third largest city in Zaire. Accounts of the Alliance's proximity to Kisangani vary from 10 km to 40 km. Alliance leader Laurent Kabila announced that his troops had met determined resistance outside the city on the road running northeast to Bafwasende, the first serious fighting of its kind between the FAZ and the Alliance since the war began. Land routes surrounding the city have been mined, resulting recently in two injuries, a U.N. official reported. News reports on March 6 told of hundreds of residents trying to flee Kisangani by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere in Zaire, the Government of Zaire (GOZ) on March 9 conceded the loss of Moba, the southernmost Zairian port on Lake Tanganyika. The GOZ no longer controls any ports on the lake. Reuters, quoting U.N. officials and diplomats, reports that in recent weeks Angolan troops have been involved in the fighting in Zaire, with Angolan government troops supporting the Alliance, and about 2,000 fighters from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) engaged with the FAZ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By March 13, about 75,000 refugees from Tingi- Tingi had reached Ubundu, in GOZ-held territory, about 150 km south of Kisangani. The WFP this week estimated that 35,000 IDPs were in Kisangani, with 3,000 to 4,000 arriving daily. On March 9, a U.N. interagency survey team, led by Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes, Martin Griffiths, went to Tingi- Tingi. They identified 600-1,000 vulnerable refugees who had recently emerged from the forests because they were too ill or weak to flee further. The team also visited GOZ-controlled Punia, where they saw about 200 refugees near the landing strip. The U.N. is planning to launch a renewed relief operation in Eastern Zaire, after Alliance leader Laurent Kabila appealed to the U.N. to help the Tingi-Tingi refugees. U.N. officials hope their presence at Tingi- Tingi will attract refugees from the forests nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 13 in Kisangani, a WFP-chartered Ilyushin-76 landed at the municipal airport with 30 MT of food. The food delivery was part of the U.N.  's effort to feed the IDPs in Kisangani, and the refugees in Ubundu, which Kabila has said he would not attack. Relief efforts in the area are stymied by heavy rainfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 8, Kabila declared his willingness to negotiate along the lines of a U.N. peace plan, but refused to suspend the Alliance's effort to seize Kisangani. The Government of Zaire (GOZ) called for the implementation of the U.N. plan on March 5, but has refused to agree to the establishment of humanitarian corridors in Eastern Zaire. The U.N. plan, endorsed by the Security Council on February 18, calls for an immediate end to hostilities; the withdrawal of all external forces, including mercenaries; the reaffirmation of respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and other states of the region; protection and security of all refugees and displaced persons, and the facilitation of access for humanitarian assistance; the rapid settlement of the crisis through dialogue and elections; and the convening of an international conference on peace, security, and development in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rwanda, ethnic violence continues. U.N. and local officials reported that 20 people died during the weekend of March 1-2. On February 22, unknown gunmen in Kibungo prefecture killed 21 Hutu, including 16 children. On February 9, eight Rwandan Tutsis were killed and three were wounded when gunmen attacked a convoy of minibuses about 20 km from Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of foreign humanitarian workers in Rwanda in January and February led to the curtailment of most relief activities and human rights monitoring. The victims included a Canadian priest, three Spaniards who worked for Medicos del Mundo (MDM), and two expatriate human rights monitors and three Rwandans working for the U.N. Human Rights Field Operations in Rwanda (HRFOR). Radio Rwanda on March 6 reported the surrender of 50 people who authorities claim are implicated in the murder of the HRFOR workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 13, a two-man BHR/OFDA Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) was dispatched to Nairobi. From there the team will travel to Kigali and Kampala. The DART will consult USG, UN, NGO, and local authorities to collect information, facilitate planning for humanitarian assistance for refugees and war-affected Zairians and IDPs, and send reports on the humanitarian situation to Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political/Military Situaltion In South Africa, indirect &quot;proximity&quot; talks are in recess, with representatives of the Alliance and the GOZ in consultation with their respective leaders in Zaire. The talks began on February 25, when Kabila met with President Nelson Mandela. There have been no reported meetings between Alliance and GOZ representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Kenya (GOK) will host a regional summit on the Zaire crisis on March 19, however, the GOK has not invited representatives of the Alliance, or the governments of Uganda and Rwanda. Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has not yet announced the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 7 at the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania, Theoneste Bagasora pleaded not guilty to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. According to the indictment, Bagasora, a colonel in the Rwandan defense ministry, assumed control of military and political affairs in Rwanda following President Habyarimana's death in April, 1994, after which the FAR and Interahamwe executed the genocide. To date, the ICTR has indicted 21 people, of whom 13 are in custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 26, the U.N. fired the chief administrator and deputy prosecutor of the ICTR, after the U.N. Inspector General reported waste and mismanagement. In the genocide trials in Kigali, Froduald Karamira was sentenced to death on February 14 for helping to plan and undertake the genocide in 1994. He appealed the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report released by HRFOR states that human rights has &quot;drastically deteriorated&quot; since the new year. In January, HRFOR received reports of at least 424 killings in 55 incidents, which was the highest number of killings since early 1996. of the 424 killings, 311 occurred in the four prefectures bordering Zaire; 228 were in Ruhengeri prefecture alone. HRFOR reports that insecurity has forced it drastically to curtail its monitoring work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burundi, government authorities reported on March 13 that a plot to kill the leader of the government, Major Pierre Buyoya, had been foiled. The authorities also reported that five people, including a Rwandan, had been arrested in connection with the alleged plot to kill Buyoya. The announcement came several hours after three land mines exploded in different parts of Bujumbura, killing seven people. For the next two days, the American Embassy has recommended that Americans in Bujumbura avoid travel between 7 p.m. and 5: 30 a.m., and that all vehicular travel be restricted if possible to heavily- travelled, paved roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. announced that its Consolidated Inter- Agency Appeal for the Great Lakes Emergency will be launched on March 19 in Geneva, for $326 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire: The 40,000 refugees who walked from Amisi to Tingi-Tingi on February 7 are among the 160,000 Rwandan refugees who are proceeding to Ubundu, which remains in GOZ-controlled territory, after Tingi-Tingi was abandoned on March 1. The WFP-chartered Ilyushin 76, which has begun flying food from Mwanza, Tanzania, arrived at the Kisangani municipal airport, which unlike the larger military airport 16 km outside the city is undefended by the FAZ. The WFP plans to fly up to 80 MT of food daily to Kisangani, where some of it will be distributed to the IDPs. The rest will be transshipped to Ubundu, 100 km south, and to Punia, 240 km southeast of Kisangani. Before the relief flights began, the WFP on March 8 organized a food shipment by rail to Ubundu from existing stocks in Kisangani. However, heavy rains impeded the delivery of 65 tons of food, which eventually arrived at Ubundu on March 11. Mud further delayed the distribution of food from the railhead to the refugees. Another rail shipment of 120 tons is planned this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The location of approximately 25,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees who were fleeing toward Kindu in late February remains unknown. Before Kindu fell on February 28, the refugees were known to be walking from Kalima southwest toward Kindu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Punia, the WFP flew in 12 MT of food for distribution by workers with the Catholic non- governmental organization (NGO), Caritas, during the first week of March. As of March 7 there were about 5,000 refugees there, and WFP earlier this week believed another 10,000 were on their way to the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kingulube, east of Shabunda, the UNHCR has set up a way station, manned by 10 relief workers, to provide high-protein biscuits and medicines to assist refugees and IDPs emerging from the jungle. A joint U.N.-NGO team that travelled there last month encountered great logistical difficulties while trying to find and help refugees in the area. Another UNHCR team has gone north of the town to investigate reports of refugees gathering in Nzofu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 10, the ICRC reopened its office in Uvira, and also operates in Goma and Bukavu. In Lubumbashi, the ICRC has a team that flies a DC-3 and a Beechcraft to identify victims of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kinshasa, the GOZ's relations with U.N. agencies is strained as a result of the government's expulsion from Zaire of nine permanent U.N. workers who had evacuated Kisangani on March 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda: The UNHCR reports that 1,300,582 refugees returned to Rwanda in 1996, and as of February this year about 232,000 refugees have returned from Zaire and Tanzania. Regular U.N. convoys transporting humanitarian assistance under military escort have begun between Kigali and Cyangugu, Kibuye, Gisenyi, and Ruhengeri. The WFP has also instituted regular flights to Gisenyi and Cyangugu. From February 24 to March 2, the WFP distributed 2,678 MT of food to 428,000 people, with 65% of the food going to returnees. During the same period, 1,329 returnees arrived via Cyangugu, and 446 came via Gisenyi. More returnees are expected as a result of the recent fighting in Eastern Zaire, the WFP claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi: The GRB recently announced the establishment of regroupment camps in Bujumbura Rurale and Bururi provinces. The practice of regroupment is already being enforced in the provinces of Karuzi, Kayanza, Cibitoke, Bubanza, and Muramvya. Local press reports state that, in practice, military authorities inform Burundians living in particular areas to move to the regroupment sites. If the peasants do not move to the camps, the military considers them rebels, and they could be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although conditions in the camps are satisfactory at the start, the health of the population slowly deteriorates from the increasing effects of crowding, inadequate potable water, sanitation, lack of medical care, and the inaccessibility to farm land. In recent weeks, the increased rate of forced displacement of the population has imposed a growing burden on the relief community, imperiling their neutrality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kayanza on February 12-13, the BHR/OFDA Emergency Disaster Response Coordinator (EDRC) visited three regroupment camps. Although the provincial governor told the EDRC that the camps were temporary, he did not say when the army would allow residents to move closer to their homes. At Buraniro camp, also the site of a military base, children appeared healthy and people were cultivating nearby fields. Water supplies were available. At Ninga, created in January, the camp lacked a health center. At Nyarurama, also created in January, food and water sources appeared available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typhus is reported to have spread throughout the Burundian provinces of Kayanza, Muramvya, and Karuzi. The World Health Organization (WHO) first reported the outbreak of typhus in Burundi in early February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first week of March, the WFP distributed food assistance to 115,480 beneficiaries in Burundi, including 43,755 displaced, most of whom live in regroupment camps, 43,637 people who were either returnees or internally displaced, 2,217 refugees or Burundians who received general distribution rations, 10,932 vulnerables, and 14,939 participants of WFP diversified programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Food and Agricultural Organization/WFP study found that food security in Burundi has deteriorated this year. Civil strife, population displacement, and the regional economic embargo have reduced food supplies, increased food prices, and made food less accessible. From February 24 to March 2, 1,745 Burundians repatriated from Kibangira camp in Cyangugu prefecture, Rwanda, the WFP reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania: As of March 13, there were about 359,000 refugees in Tanzania, the UNHCR reports. At least 274,000 are Burundian, and the remainder are Zairian. In the Ngara camps, there are 105,000 refugees; of the total, 59,000 are in Lukole camp, with the remainder in the former Lumasi camp, now called Lukole C. In the Kigoma region, there are about 254,000 refugees. As of February 28, there were 23,195 refugees in holding areas in Kigoma town.  Ninety percent of them are Zairian. Tanzania is receiving about 1,000 refugees daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 26, BHR/OFDA deployed a USAID/DART to Kigali, Rwanda, to conduct assessments, report on the situation, and provide funding to NGOs, U.N.  agencies, and international organizations for programs to assist in repatriation efforts. USAID/DART completed operations on February 25. On November 7, 1996, U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda Robert Gribbin declared a disaster, noting that the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire posed a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda. On November 12, U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson declared a disaster in Zaire as a result of the violent break-up of refugee camps in eastern Zaire. On November 18, the USG pledged $140 million in humanitarian and development assistance to address needs in the Great Lakes region. On November 25, Ambassador Morris Hughes declared a disaster in Burundi as a result of continuing civil strife. From February 12 to 26, BHR/OFDA deployed an assessment team to Zaire, to evaluate relief needs in the GOZ-controlled areas of Eastern Zaire. Prevented from travelling outside Kinshasa, the team met daily with NGOs and U.N. agencies in the capital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six security policemen have applied for amnesty and their applications contain details of the identities of people they allegedly murdered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRC investigators, working with a team of body exhumation specialists, pathologists and South African Police Services video unit have thus far uncovered two bodies on a farm previously occupied by members of the security branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team is currently involved in the exhumation of a further two bodies.  The amnesty applicants took TRC investigators to a site on the banks of the Tugela River and confirmed that two people were shot and their bodies were weighted down with rocks and thrown into the river. They then led the TRC investigators to other sites at Bulwer and at Phoenix near Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicants also confirmed that four more people were blown up in such a way that very little remained of their bodies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TRC is in a process of confirming the identities of the deceased and notifying the next of kin and a press conference would follow in due course once the information has been confirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The trade union movement is lagging far behind in tackling discrimination against women, Minister of Labour Tito Mboweni has charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech to the national bargaining conference of the Chemical Workers' Industrial Union in Johannesburg, Mr Mboweni said he had the impression that organised labour was committed to tackling race inequality but not gender inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The union movement is lagging far behind Parliament, Cabinet, Government and even business. It is now time for the union movement to address this in action without making excuses or simply passing resolutions,&quot; Mr Mboweni said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And have you really taken steps to address inequalities in the workplace?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How long is it going to continue that women are restricted to the low-wage jobs in the sector?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said the ball was &quot;primarily in management's court&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he asked the union: &quot;Are you explaining the need for change to your members or are you sitting back and blaming management?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the controversial issue of labour market flexibility, Mr Mboweni said &quot; much nonsense&quot; was spoken about this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Job creation had to be a priority, with unemployment estimated at up to 33 percent. And in some sectors, he said, wage levels and labour unrest did discourage job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no running away from this. Wage levels which are unrelated to productivity and the structure of that sector may lead to fewer jobs. And labour unrest may lead employers to favour machinery rather than people - which is one of the major reasons for improving our dispute resolution system.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mboweni said South Africa's labour market was not efficient enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our approach is that where there are unnecessary rigidities in our labour market and in our economy and they must be removed. But this should not be done in ways which undermine labour security and union rights in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not support the view which calls for deregulation,&quot; he said, noting that in some areas more regulation, not less, was needed. In other instances, the market was too inflexible,&quot; said Mr Mboweni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Examples cited by him included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to wage setting which in some cases did not take account of differences in regions, sectors and small or new businesses;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Restrictions on firms working on a continuous basis, reducing employment levels and productivity of investment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Excessive overtime, with social and health effects and a regulatory framework which should be changed so that more people worked rather than the same number of people working more; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Archaic and complex employment conditions set by some bargaining councils which protected labour security in &quot;a narrow and old-fashioned way&quot; and which could discourage small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His department's call for &quot;labour security with flexibility&quot; was not a &quot; compromise between the left and the right&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A cat sunny side up in the sitting room; just beyond its paw is Professor Chris Damerell, a physicist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxford, and visiting professor at Brunel University, London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's among more than 1 600 past pupils of Rondebosch Boys High in Cape Town for the school's centenary dinner tonight, at which the guest speaker will be former South African Chief Justice M M Corbett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Chris will talk to the Rondebosch Boys' High School science club and do a presentation at UCT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cat's tail frisks crisp scientific diagrams and papers. This is the world of atoms, empty spaces, colliding loops of electrons and positrons, whizzing quarks and quirky events15 billion years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris is as lean as a laser; his is one of those remarkable minds that is able to beam the complexities of his lifelong scientific passion with clarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My love of science was cultivated firstly in Mr Van Oort's biology lab, where I spent many happy hours after school using his microscope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was followed by the inspirational teaching of physics by Mr Jayes, and of mathematics by Mr De Jager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember an inspiring talk by Allan Cormack, who was later to win the Nobel Prize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris was awarded the Duddell Medal and Prize at a grand dinner at London's Savoy Hotel recently, a medal awarded annually to a person who has made outstanding contributions to the application of physics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife Joan puts her head around the sitting room door: &quot;Don't get too complicated explaining it all!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put simply, Chris developed the micro-chips of the type used in video cameras, as detectors of sub-atomic particles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When high energy particles pass through these chips they release a trail of electrical charges that can be used to measure their path with unprecedented accuracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This 'tracking microscope' opens the eyes of the scientists to the heavy quarks that comprise some of the building blocks of sub-atomic particles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris and his group recently assembled 480 of these micro-chips into a $4- million instrument at the heart of a 4 000-ton detector, which has been installed in a $60-million project at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre in Silicon Valley in California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you'd expected the absent-minded professor about Chris, well, you wouldn't get it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no hair standing on end, or dotty socks - all is fine tuned as a cat's whisker, and his ability to inspire bodes well for the budding scientists at his old school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joan and Chris's daughter, Silvana, is studying public relations in Leeds.  Their son, Richard, is studying Russian and at the moment spending a year in Voronezh in the former Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But let's go back 15 billion years when the universe was a gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People say, 'so what,' you found those quarks, they live for almost no time, what use are they? You can answer that on two levels, to one of which I made a small contribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Applying the laws of physics and calculating the extremely small universe 15 billion years ago with its tremendous concentration of matter and energy, you'd expect by now to have just cold diffuse gas spreading throughout the universe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead we have galaxies and stars and planets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where does our universe come from? Well, the law of physics that governs the very small scale is called the quantum theory, a theory that allows fluctuations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the super-hot quark soup of the early universe, fluctuations meant that some regions would be slightly more dense than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Worked on over billions of years by gravity, these would pull in matter from other areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When this matter reached a certain density it would ignite and form stars and galaxies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's scientifically why we're interested in this tie-up between the very biggest and the very smallest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other level is the practical one, as technical and medical benefits flow from the acclerators and detectors developed originally to study atoms and quarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are plans to build a detector 10 times larger than the one at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has to do with revolutionising the pulsed-power industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The next phase will be a couple of multi-billion dollar global laboratories, and new inventions are changing the way we will use them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, also a Duddell Medal and Prize winner, so that we scientists could communicate data, then it exploded from there!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're talking at a good time, Chris says. The electron was discovered in 1897, there are big centenary celebrations in the United Kingdom.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accelerators began to be developed in the 20s, became national facilites around the 60s, when he was a graduate student, and these days we have expanded to regional facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From under the cat's paw, he pulls a final sheet of paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's listed a remarkable number of people from Rondebosch Boys' High and UCT graduates who've excelled in this area of science - Godfrey Stafford (Director of the Rutherford Laboratory), Allan Cormack (Nobel prizewinner), John Thresher (director of a laborary in Geneva), George Ellis (applied maths professor at UCT and a great authority on cosmology), David Dorfan (Dean of Science at Santa Cruz) and his brother, Jonathon (Stanford Professor), David Ashman (UCT Professor of Physics) to name some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This globalisation means that hopefully from now on we South Africans don't have to emigrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It should be possible to get groups together at the unversities who will via the web participate in this stuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we're only going to have two accelerators in the world the hope is that we can make these things really accessible to scientists everywhere to genuinely participate completely in this research.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A major public workshop is to be held this weekend as the next step in the planning of an economic corridor which could generate thousands of jobs and improve the infrastructure in the poorer areas of the Cape Flats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planning phase of the Wetton-Lansdowne Corridor is expected to be complete by mid-year and, if it gets the go-ahead, could also result in a road linking the business district of Wynberg to Philippi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed corridor is part of the Metropolitan Spatial Development Framework (MSDF), a programme aimed at reversing the apartheid era's separation of disadvantaged communities from routes to the city's conventional business districts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, most of the people living along the proposed corridor have to travel to the city centre to their places of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is envisaged the economic corridor could create the conditions for attracting businesses to this route and create employment for thousands of Cape Flats residents on the Cape Flats itself. The planners of the Wetton- Lansdowne Corridor believe this link road would:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Improve access to facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Improve service delivery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Improve public transport efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Increase economic activity and opportunities for the affected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Integrate adjoining housing estates and provide opportunities for higher density housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project also aims to identify vacant land along the corridor and develop this for the benefit of the surrounding communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of the main features of the MSDF, Philippi East has been earmarked as an economic node. It is envisaged the new business district node will complement the well-developed central business districts of Cape Town, Bellville and Claremont/Wynberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town Planner Dave Gough, who is managing the project, said Philippi had an existing industrial area but that this centre was virtually starved of basic services which served as a deterrent to possible investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the corridor, when complete, would provide these services and hopefully attract investors leading to more jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Town City Council's project team has consulted various stakeholders in the areas affected by the proposed corridor to get as much input as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public workshop will be held at 9am tomorrow at the large exhibition hall at the Civic Centre to discuss the progress of the planning process for the corridor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Argus - Five of South Africa's leading universities have followed the international trend of recognising gay and lesbian unions by extending full marital benefits to gay and lesbian staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country where one in every three marriages ends in divorce and where a majority of households in many areas are headed by single women, the conventional role of marriage and the structure of the family unit undoubtedly are under challenge. Whether or not this is desirable from a religious or social point of view, the fact is that these trends are very real and reflect a fundamental and probably permanent change in South African society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise the indisputable existence of large numbers of gay and lesbian citizens who enter into longterm same-sex relationships, sometimes with one or both partners having custody of children, further challenges the conventional view of heterosexual marriage as the only recognisable form of union between indviduals and the only basis for family life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite aside from South Africa's new constitution - the first to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation - the profound changes in the conventional view of &quot;marriage&quot; and &quot;family&quot; have been a pervasive reality for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the five universities which have extended marital rights to gay and lesbian staff have done, first and foremost, is to respond to this reality in a rational, realistic and enlightened way. Gay and lesbian staff who are committed to longterm relationships, and the children who may be affected, are now entitled to the same pension and medical benefits, and the security which these bring, as heterosexual staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the new constitution has done is to provide an official and legal framework for the move by the universities. It should also encourage other universities - and society as a whole - to end the widespread discrimination which gay and lesbian citizens have endured for many generations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Three years after the country's peaceful transition from white- minority rule, the South African National Defence Force, that last battalion of footsoldiers of apartheid is finally marching into the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SANDF is even planning a gender conference this month to thrash out a new policy that would make the defence force more feminine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Defence Joe Modise spells out three targets the defence force wants to achieve: entrenching civil control, making the force more representative of the population, and making it accountable - and affordable - to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defence ministry is committed to accelerate its transformation programme to strengthen and modernise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have spent the last 2 and half years preparing the groundwork for our defence in the 21st century,&quot; said Mr Modise.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the first target - putting civilians in control of the defence force, had been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been achieved by the new constitution, the Defence White Paper, the role of Parliament, and the Joint Standing Committee on Defence had been particularly energetic as a watchdog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civilian National Conventional Arms Control Committee, chaired by Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal, was launched to police the arms industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apartheid conscription system had been abandoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formerly all-white, part-time forces - made up of the Citizen Force and commandos - had been downsized from more than 500 000 to about 20 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Modise said the upper echelons of the management of defence had been shaken-up radically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new integrated head office dubbed the &quot;Ministry of Defence&quot;, was created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This meant the previously separate commands of the army, air force, navy and the South African Medical Services, had been fused into one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defence secretariate to assist the defence ministry in policy formulation and implementation was invented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Modise says that in order to give the civilian Defence Secretary the necessary clout, the position will be both the head of the defence department and the accounting officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary for Defence and the chief of the SANDF now operate at the same hierarchical level under the minister, but with separate responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary for Defence serves as the minister's policy advisor and the Chief of the SANDF, the minister's military advisor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only last week, legislation to transfer the status of head of department and accounting officer from SANDF chief Georg Meiring to civilian Defence Secretary Pierre Steyn had been rushed through the National Assembly's defence committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Modise says this streamlining eliminates duplication of administrative functions, increases efficiency, and cuts costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will produce a saving of R300-million in the first year alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reorganisation will continue through to the provincial territorial commands and, below them, the group headquarters and to the part-time force system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Modise and the defence force gurus are working overtime to complete the force's policy blueprint, the Defence Review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The much talked about Review outlines the defence's vision on the three Ms: the money, machines and military personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Modise hopes it will be ready for presentation to Parliament in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Review will be the most logical guide for government, treasury and Parliament, to weigh up defence needs and to decide what is the most appropriate and affordable budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another key target is integration of the former liberation armies into the new SANDF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Modise admits there are certain &quot;tensions and perceptions of racism, problems with discipline&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are being tackled, and we will not tolerate any manifestation of racism in the SANDF,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 590 people discharged from the defence force for disciplinary reasons, 46 were former Apla, 152 former MK, and 112 former homeland troops, and 280 former SADF members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new SANDF is 63 percent black - African, coloured and Indian. There are 11 black generals, including the country's first woman general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a measure of progress, Mr Modise points out, four out of the nine provincial territorial commands in the country are run by black generals and four of the remaining five have black chiefs of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the SANDF will represent the population demography within the next 10 to 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regular SANDF numbers just over 98 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Modise says that with rationalisation and downsizing, there will be a reduction of about 20 percent of the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well over 4 000 members already have taken voluntary severance packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2 700 were from the former SADF and 1 300 from homeland forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The review will set the vision for affirmative action, equal opportunity and civic education to create a more representative military, with an ethos and culture in step with the our new democratic values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Modise says that, given budgetary cuts, the biggest problem for the defence force is that of obsolete equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall defence budget has been slashed 50 percent since 1989, with the government's spending on defence now below two percent of GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1997-1998 Budget announced by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel on Wednesday, the defence budget was cut 9,4 percent to R9 587,7-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Manuel, in his Budget speech, commended the defence force for the substantial restructuring it had undertaken and for the seriousness with which it had approached the government's efforts to reallocate spending away from defence towards social development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Manuel also lauded the role defence played in the National Crime Prevention Strategy, deploying about 50 companies of troops for border protection and maintaining law and order in co-operation with the police service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Modise argues that, as much as the defence force needs the right personnel, structures and values for the 21st century, so too it needs the right equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in danger of all our main equipment becoming obsolete by 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is why we have made ships for our navy and modern equipment for our army and air force a priority,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the SANDF has an important role to play in promoting peace and stability in the Southern African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Events are bearing out our view that we have an important role to play in the region, and we are gearing ourselves to assume these responsibilities,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cape Town property prices will soar if the city's bid to host the 2004 Olympics succeeds, with demand for land and accommodation mounting to match an unprecedented development bonanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demand is expected to grow for residential, commercial and industrial property throughout the city, and development hubs are likely to spring up as a direct result of Olympic projects in Wingfield, Culemborg on the Foreshore, Mew Way in Khayelitsha, Philippi East and Belhar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have already been indications that property prices in the city - already the fastest-growing property area in South Africa - are on the rise after Cape Town's shortlisting last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real spur to development, and rising property values, will be its selection as the host city for the 2004 event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estate agents canvassed in a survey commissioned by the Olympic Bid Company predict the Games will bring &quot;massive investment and development&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bottom line is that an estimated 8 750 residential housing units, providing accommodation for about 35 000 people, five hotels, 54 000 sq m of retail space and 73 000 sq m of commercial space will be developed as a direct result of Cape Town hosting the Games,&quot; said Peter Golding, managing director of Golding Commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey found that Olympic developments &quot;will uplift a number of key, previously under-developed areas in the Cape Peninsula, and this, with infrastructure upgrading, will create unprecedented urban growth and development in the Western Cape&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of these developments are being built as part of the bidding phase and will have a positive impact whether or not the city's bid wins. But winning would have far-reaching implications, with prices and rentals rising sharply as demand grows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey, done by Golding Commercial and the Bid Company, sought to assess the impact of the Olympic project on residential, commercial and retail property markets, to enhance the planning process, and identify potential pitfalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate statement this week, property company executive Samuel Seeff said that despite high interest rates, the already strong residential market &quot; can be expected to receive an added boost as a result of a victory&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The demand will be so widespread that you will find previously unpopular areas close to the inner city being developed for residential purposes. This has been the experience in Sydney so far, and we will hopefully see development happening in District Six, the Culemborg area, and parts of Salt River and Woodstock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Seeff also predicted that &quot;a lot&quot; of companies would move to Cape Town to take advantage of new business flowing from the Games project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A successful bid would mean a property boom for the city and region. This has been the experience in other host cities. In Sydney, host city of the 2000 Games, the property market has shown an increase of 15 to 20 percent over the past year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharp price increases are expected in the rental market, which is already experiencing acute shortages in some areas, as landlords anticipate higher demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report does not touch on the issue, but it is clear there will be mounting pressure on the authorities to introduce legislation to limit the impact on less well-off people living in rented accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Development Action Group has been at the forefront of this campaign, arguing the case for anti-eviction legislation and measures to cater for people who cannot afford soaring rentals and are unable to enter the formal market.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Both Netscape and Microsoft have unveiled the next versions of their browsers, Navigator 4.0 and Internet Explorer 4.0.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Navigator Pre-Release 2, released on February 24 for free download and evaluation, is actually a suite called Netscape Communicator, with Navigator 4.0 built in. Netscape promises to deliver the final commercial version of Communicator in April or May, while Microsoft is aiming Explorer 4.0 at a June or July final release.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Netscape's head start give it the competitive advantage? Read the Netscape Communicator home page http://www.netscape.com/comprod/products/co mmunicator/index.html, and download the 10MB file from there, or go to your nearest TUCOWS archive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Netscape Communicator is closer to Internet Explorer 3.0 than to a new paradigm of browsing, with 3D control buttons and a floating toolbar that gives you one-click access to new mail, chat and Web editing tools. It's when one considers what it could have been that you understand the extent to which Navigator has fallen behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could have been Internet Explorer 4.0. Visit http://www.microsoft.  com/ie/ie40/ to get an advance preview. By the time you read this, you may already be able to download the alpha version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Installing Explorer 4.0 upgrades Windows 95 to something close to Windows 97. When the new version of Windows arrives around August it will have Explorer 4.0 built in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most dazzling new feature of Explorer is something called Active Channels, under which information and entertainment Web- based &quot;channels&quot; are organised within a browser-type window, with a menu which lists available channels, under categories like Sport, Kids, News and Business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See an extended review version of this column at http://www.mg.co.  za/mg/pc/pcrevie1.htm to see why, by the end of this year, Netscape will be just another bit player on the browser stage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Another international women's magazine, Marie Claire, is launching a local issue, but the interests of most women in South Africa are still being neglected, say local black editors. Gillian Farquhar reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMPETITION is hotting up in the magazine market with internationally acclaimed French title Marie Claire poised to launch its local edition in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming close on the heels of the local launches of French-owned Elle and American- owned Ebony, the newest foreign kid on the block has a tough task ahead amid South Africa's shifting readership patterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many women's magazine editors say that while Marie Claire is a very competitive product globally, it is unlikely to find more than a very small niche position in the local market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black magazine editors argue that foreign titles launching here do not adequately attempt to tailor themselves towards expressing local culture and are simply extensions of their international siblings, with little else to offer South African readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also argue that while the market of the future lies in the growing black middle class, the predominantly white-owned local publishing houses largely continue to neglect the magazines already addressing this market, vying vigorously to acquire rights to prestigious foreign titles instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True Love editor Khanyi Dhlomo-Mkhize says the revamp among local black magazines has come too late, forcing more &quot;aspirational black people&quot; to read across the traditionally white magazine market. She agrees that publications like Femina, Fair Lady, Cosmopolitan and Elle focus largely on white readers, but it is not necessarily racist for a magazine to cater predominantly for the needs of one cultural group, she says, as reader identity is central and the &quot;key to a magazine's success&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while local white women's magazines have come a long way in multi- cultural coverage, there is still a tendency to cover only high-profile black people rather than the issues, and to do so from the perspective of the &quot; other&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dhlomo-Mkhize says True Love steers away from featuring local black models on covers because the status of the model in South Africa is nowhere near as high-profile as internationally. She agrees with Cosmopolitan editor Vanessa Raphaely that using a local black model on a title with a predominantly white readership affects sales negatively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bona editor Willie Bokalo questions whether it is feasible for magazines to successfully carry off the frequently espoused multi-cultural approach.  Magazines like Marie Claire and Elle might appeal to the broader market in 10 or 20 years time, but not now, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bokalo also argues that Ebony, although a magazine for black readers, is &quot; totally missing the mark by reporting on South African issues and affairs from a US perspective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dholomo-Mkhize agrees: &quot;There are still inspirational black US role models and issues that South African readers can benefit from, but the interest in foreign goods is on the wane as black South Africans no longer put US culture on a pedestal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Drum bureau chief Ramotena Mabote argues that the &quot;sophisticated upwardly mobile black woman&quot; will choose magazines that address her identity within her own culture and that this will always be more attractive than any foreign perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when the circulation of most women's magazines is down, the huge increase in True Love's readers since its revamp is evidence of this, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he criticises some of the local magazines, both black and white, for still not doing enough to reflect cultural diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marie Claire will be published locally by Republican Press under a franchise agreement with French publisher Marie Claire Album, and initial circulation figures are projected to be in the 50 000 region, according to local edition editor Pnina Fenster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Audit Bureau of Circulation figures showing overall magazine circulation figures plummeting to 251 000 last year, and almost all women's magazines reflecting the downward trend, Fenster admits that competition is tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's re-entry into the international arena is a fitting time for Marie Claire to launch here, as &quot;building the budding internationalism in South Africa's women was the magazine's mission statement&quot;, she says, adding that there will be an equal balance between local and international fashion and features.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also says Marie Claire will feature covers of local black models although this is rarely done in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But editors across the board agree that, for the moment at least, much greater reader interest lies in local issues, personalities and events, although foreign titles have a certain exotic appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Femina editor Jane Raphaely contends that while the local brands Femina and Fair Lady are successful brands in the older market, both of these and Cosmopolitan also now enjoy a growing black readership - and the three editors put the figure for their respective publications at between 30% and 40% black.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A milestone in educational programming on television and radio has been reached with the SABC's new Learn 'N Live initiative, giving independent producers an unprecendented opportunity to make their mark by replacing the SABC's traditionally stodgy fare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Learn 'N Live, a joint initiative between the SABC and the Department of Education, not only aims to &quot;forge a nation of critical thinkers, but also provide a forum for new talent, creativity and vision among independent producers&quot;, says Nicola Golombik, manager of SABC educational television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Golombik is spearheading the project with Dr Teboho Moja, general manager of educational television, and Fakir Hassan, manager of educational radio.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Learn 'N Live was initiated in November 1996, with about R22-million at its disposal, courtesy of the Department of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The process was transparent&quot;, says Golombik. &quot;More than 50% of available programme space was commissioned to independent producers and we've received more than 300 proposals from independent producers from around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More importantly, we are creating work opportunities at a time when jobs for independent producers are scarce, and providing a platform for new talent that can identify with our target audiences,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially launched on SABC2 on March 1, the education project's prime attractions will be youth programmes which explore issues ranging from rave and kwaito culture to health and the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, Take 5 - a daily magazine programme targeting audiences aged five to 20 - includes in its lineup Spider's Place, a pioneering production by the Handspring Trust for Puppetry in Education, which teaches science through the adventures of Spider the street child and her equally street- smart mates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another first for South Africa in the Take 5 lineup is Rena Thina which explores socio-cultural and lifestyle issues using a mix of drama and documentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And lest you believe that education means exploring only the mind, in Private and Confidential former Miss South Africa Jacqui Mofokeng goes (wo) manual in a programme dealing with issues ranging from make-up to masturbation. And while women take time off to get in touch with their sexual selves, the international versions of Sesame Street and Channel 4's Fourways Farm will be screened for toddlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to be outdone, radio will provide programmes in all 11 official languages, focusing particularly on lively educational chat shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been charged with the task not only of using our public broadcaster to support the development of a culture of learning&quot;, says Moja, but &quot;we will begin to create a nation of people who are able to think critically. This is a necessity if South Africa is to flourish into the next century.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The launch of new magazine Men's Health into a market traditionally dominated by finance, sport or &quot;titillating&quot; editorial will be an interesting one to watch. The editorial will comprise health and fitness issues, but essentially it will be a lifestyle magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain there are a number of lifestyle publications aimed at men, but the two with the highest circulations are both based on a formula of beer, sex and soccer. For example, the circulation firgures for July to December 1996 are GQ 148 574, Esquire 111 007, Loaded 323 115, FHM 365 341, Stuff 60 592, Maxim 150 261, Men's Health 158 945.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the local market, only the business sector showed growth - F&amp;T Weekly's was phenomenal - and some of the sports magazines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be interesting to see if Men's Health will change the typecast that local men, like their British counterparts, want sport, sex and beer. Men's Health will be the acid test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May Marie Claire is launching into the highly competitive female interest category. Perhaps it will force the existing titles to breathe new life into themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the AMPS 1996 survey, 1,1- million women don't read any magazines at all, 516 000 of them are aged between 25 and 49 years, and 660 000 are Afrikaans speaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the reasons cited for the massive decline in woman's interest magazines is lack of money; however, 187 000 women live in households which earn more than R6 000 per month and 139 000 have a personal income of more than R2 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality, many women do not read magazines because there are no magazines that cater for their interests, they are &quot;homeless&quot; magazine readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's magazines need to re-invent themselves or look at what international publishers are doing to maintain interest. Internationally, magazine publishers have moved into multi-disciplinary publishing, for example, exhibitions, conferences, database marketing and award ceremonies.  These activities are used to build relationships between magazines and their readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internationally, Cosmopolitan has moved from being the publisher of a title, to a magazine that represents a lifestyle and a set of values. It has achieved this through developments in eyewear, music compilation tapes, keep fit videos, a board game, career titles in association with Penguin - The Cosmopolitan Guide to Getting Ahead - stationery, and an exhibition at Earls Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locally, Cosmopolitan recently organised a &quot;designer&quot; clothing sale for their Cape Town readers. These activities serve to forge links with readers making Cosmopolitan a way of life. Local magazines should take a &quot;leaf out their magazine&quot; and start doing something to stem the decline!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The financial magazine has threatened to sue Business Day and M&amp;G for publishing allegations of unethical behaviour about its owner, reports Mungo Soggot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE battle of the media industry's financial gurus intensified this week as Finance Week threatened legal action against its rival Business Day and vowed to publish a personal attack on its editor Jim Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Week's broadside follows Business Day's publication last week of allegations of unethical behaviour by David Gleason, Finance Week's new owner and star columnist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Day published excerpts of statements signed by top executives from Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) in which they suggested Gleason had tried to extort the bank two years ago when he was writing for the Financial Mail. Both Business Day and the Financial Mail are part of the Times Media Limited (TML) group.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason, who bought Finance Week last year, allegedly offered to stop writing a string of critical articles about RMB if the bank favoured mining house Randgold in a particular mining deal. Gleason has denied the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statements were published last week in the Mail &amp; Guardian, which is also being sued for defamation. Finance Week is being advised by media law expert advocate Gilbert Marcus, SC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Week said it would resurrect the tale that Jim Jones was once supplied with illegally taped telephone conversations of former Sage chief Louis Shill, who later became a National Party housing minister. It also alleges that Jones once looked through confidential documents belonging to former Financial Mail editor Stephen Mulholland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Week editor Nigel Bruce, who resigned as editor of the Financial Mail at the end of last year and followed Gleason, accuses Business Day of having &quot;no scruples&quot; for publishing the confidential documents two years later. The documents were found in Bruce's former office at TML's Rosebank headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce told the M&amp;G this week that the dispute boiled down to RMB's word against Gleason's. &quot;He (Gleason) has conistently denied it, and it is really his word against theirs. I have never had any reason to doubt his (Gleason's) integrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He surmises that both RMB senior executives who accused Gleason - managing director Paul Harris and Wendy Lucas-Bull, who also heads Business Against Crime - &quot;misinterpreted&quot; Gleason on two separate occasions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce says: &quot;I do not wish to call their integrity into doubt, but they were calling the integrity of one of my colleagues into doubt. They (the bank) would not concede any possibility of misinterpretation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce said the bank had a motive to make the allegation as Gleason had written the critical articles about it. Gleason, however, had no motive to ask the bank to favour Randgold. Gleason's articles described RMB's role in the R162-million financing loss of the Umgeni Water Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce says that when RMB managing director Paul Harris originally demanded that he sack Gleason, he said he would do no such thing until &quot;...you can explain why he (Gleason) has done this...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce says: &quot;I took the allegations very seriously, but nothing could ever be tied down ... It was not my place to investigate a possible motive when the accusers could not even suggest one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time RMB declined his invitation to sue the Financial Mail for defamation or charge Gleason with extortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce and Gleason have refused to confirm or deny rumours that certain Randgold directors helped fund Gleason's take over of Finance Week last year from Lynne Hill, wife of Oliver Hill, the alleged fraudster facing extradition from Britain. But he says there was &quot;no question&quot; Gleason had business dealings prior to joining the Financial Mail with certain Randgold board members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce concedes that Gleason has written some favourable articles on Randgold but says: &quot;All his arguments have been structured arguments and logical arguments. Where there is illogicality we will be discredited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce says he was particularly upset by the M&amp;G's publication of a photograph portraying Gleason in a BMW with the caption: &quot;Gleason in his BMW 850i that was previously owned by Randgold boss Brett Kebble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce stresses that the BMW was bought through a dealer for &quot;fair value&quot;, adding that Gleason has decided to sell the car because it is &quot;clearly bad luck&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce says his co-operation with the M&amp;Gthis week does not rule out legal action, as last week's defamatory allegations have been repeated. He insists the Gleason affair is not a matter of public interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - the Daily Dispatch's circulation has grown in leaps and bounds, thrusting this small East London-based player into the ring with some of the big boys of print media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gavin Stewart (54), who took over the newspaper's helm three years ago, has stealthily changed its format and content into an explosive formula which has put the newspaper's circulation in the same league as financial daily Business Day and mainstream broadsheet the Sunday Independent. In three years it has boosted its sales by 4 000 copies a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the overnight change which took place at the Cape Argus, the Daily Dispatch's revamp was a gradual process resulting in record sales for every month of 1996 and new records for January and February this year, when it reached an average of 40 200 sales a day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past year alone, the Daily Dispatch had a circulation increase of 7, 3%: from 37 458 between July and December 1995 to 38 546 in the same period of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Argus, however, has lost more than a quarter of its readers since June 1993 - its daily circulation dropped from a 110 777 in 1993 to 82 142 in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was mixed reaction to the new-look Cape Argus with some critics arguing that the changes were superficial, while others welcomed the look as a breath of fresh air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart argues that change in a newspaper's format is telling &quot;intelligent readers that they have been reading rubbish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important not to shock the reader.Your first duty is to do no harm; you have to make sure you do not lose any of your loyal readers,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formerly an independent publication owned by Dispatch Media, the Daily Dispatch - which will celebrate its 125th anniversary this year - was bought by Times Media Limited (TML) in December 1995 and has proved to be a profitable asset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its burgeoning sales, the Daily Dispatch has made the unusual choice not to sell copies in the Port Elizabeth region, the domain of its rival, the Eastern Province Herald, also part of the TML stable. It is &quot;not cost effective&quot;, says Stewart. &quot;We do not cater for the locals and we could never beat them on retail and employment advertising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half of the Dispatch's sales are in areas outside its urban centre, East London, such as Grahamstown, Kokstad, Umzimkulu and inland to Aliwal North and the Lesotho border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formerly the head of Rhodes University's journalism department, Stewart says news has become more provincial. &quot;Provincial and local government are the pipelines of delivery and people want to know what they are doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concentrating on provincial news has paid off for the Daily Dispatch, but some other provincial publications such as the Natal Mercury (-32,6%) and Natal Witness (-31,7%) have suffered heavy losses over the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daily Dispatch news editor Lew Elias is more critical of the print media.  He challenges the apathy of national mainstream newspapers who fail to pick up on important provincial stories because &quot;they are too absorbed in national stories, failing to realise the impact that regional stories can have on readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Radio and the wire services regularly run our local news but somehow the print media do not see it as hard enough news,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a readership of 60% black (mostly Xhosa-speakers) and 40% white, the Daily Dispatch has done remarkably well in capturing the imagination of its readership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also has a newsroom which is predominantly black: &quot;These reporters are not affirmative action recruits but are the right people to get the job done,&quot; says Elias, adding that the improved circulation is &quot;either due to us doing something right in the newsroom or the Education Department making huge strides in its adult literacy programmes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - IT could take 10 to 15 years for the government's strategy to promote small and medium-sized enterprises to start paying off in tangible terms, Trade and Industry Deputy Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Replying to the debate on the parliamentary trade and industry committee's special report on small business finance, Mlambo- Ngcuka said it would take that long to erase the baggage of apartheid and create a level playing field for small business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report had been critical of some aspects of the government's plans to promote small and medium-sized enterprises (SMMEs) and many MPs complained during the debate that not enough was being done quickly enough to help SMMEs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said experience in Europe and Asia had shown that developing SMMEs was no quick or easy task and the fact that South Africa had to overcome numerous structural problems had not made the task easier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are happy that in one year (since the launch of the national small business strategy) we have been able to successfully establish four institutions to address all the issues identified,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were the Centre for Small Business Promotion, Khula Enterprise Finance Limited, Ntsika Enterprise Promotion Agency and the National Small Business Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She agreed that these alone would not do the trick and that the provinces would have to provide additional support in the form of capacity building for support services. For its part, the government would, within the limits of the fiscus, do what it could to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report had taken issue with the fact that it had taken so long for Khula to come on stream. Mlambo-Ngcuka said it was true that it had only been capitalised in September 1996, but that this had been due to protracted negotiations with the Small Business Development Corporation to withdraw part of government's share capital. It also took time to appoint the board and senior staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it had been able to grant loan finance, operating funds and capacity- building funds to seven institutions worth R34-million. In all, 18 institutions have been evaluated for support and guarantees had been extended to 117 loans made by banks valued at R29-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks had also not responded fully to the credit guarantee scheme offered by Khula, which was only being 45% used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, it was not appreciated that Khula had been established as a wholesale agency. This meant that it could not lend directly to small businesses but would find partners who could act as intermediaries to lend money directly to small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khula had started trying to make banks aware of the scheme but Mlambo- Ngcuka admitted that much more needed to be done to create a banking sector that was more responsive to the needs of SMMEs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntsika was now ready with a funding model for local business service centres and would provide a capacity-building programme this year. But this was an entirely new concept and there were no role models with which to match the way forward and &quot;we had to undergo a considerable amount of growing pains which will be corrected under the new priorities,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main focus would be decentralisation to provide a better provincial focus, better monitoring of SMME needs and more direct face-to-face consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new branch network of central business service centres would be launched from July this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She supported the committee's recommendation that the small business budget should be re-examined but said that other sources of financing were also being identified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The tobacco industry has been unanimous in its condemnation of the 52% increase in excise duty on cigarettes, saying it &quot;is yet another punitive increase which discriminates against a third of the country's adults&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his address to Parliament on Wednesday, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said &quot;substantial increases in the excise duties on tobacco are again proposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rate of duty on tobacco will increase by 52%, bringing the tax, including VAT, to 50% of the average retail price. Smokers will have to pay an extra 27 cents per 10 cigarettes. Pipe tobacco will cost an extra R2,49 per kilogram,&quot; Manuel announced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry watchdog, the Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa has labelled the increase as &quot;unfair and incredible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the fourth year running the tax increase on smokers is outrageous. In 1994 the increase was 25%, again 25% in 1995, and 18% in 1996, every time double or three times the inflation rate. Now, it is an incredible five times inflation,&quot; said the institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry insiders have been warning since 1994 that the annual tax hikes could lead to a marked increase in smuggling and related crime. &quot;Smuggling of illegal cigarettes, which was triggered by the 1994 and subsequent tax hikes, is now widespread, with contraband cigarettes available in all parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The effects of yet another tax increase on tobacco farming, on employment on farms and on employment of workers in the processing industry have been pointed out to the government. Perhaps the government should come and face the workers, who know that such excessive taxes will deprive them of their livelihood in favour of tax-free smuggled cigarettes from elsewhere,&quot; the institute said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A researcher at the institute, Joh Groenewald, told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the government had the &quot;clear example of Canada where it was realised in 1994 that unrealistic increases in cigarette taxes had more negative than positive effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the Canadian government slashed their taxes, people reverted to smoking legal cigarettes, which put a stop to large-scale smuggling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that it was important to bear in mind that smokers will not be convinced to relinquish their habit when cigarette prices increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our research shows that the amount of smokers and cigarettes smoked stayed constant in spite of the increased taxes ... In Mpumalanga cigarettes are going for 99 cents per packet which people will buy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this trend is sustained, it could spell disaster for the industry,&quot; said Groenewald.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Manuel has tinkered with income tax, but we'll have to wait for the Katz Commission report for a more holistic approach, reports Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE of these days, South Africans may enjoy a more equitable income tax system - but not yet. In its pre-Budget presentation, the South African Chamber of Business estimated that effective elimination of bracket creep would cost the exchequer R6,5-billion. In reality, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has set aside R2,8-billion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While relief at the lower end of the tax scale is to be welcomed, Manuel has provided little leeway for the middle- income earner - even the old British Labour Party would baulk at a 45% marginal tax rate for earnings over a mere R100 000. But then again, this was never flagged as an income-tax adjusting Budget - the money has to come from somewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dramatic changes to the whole tax structure will take longer to put into effect, depending on when the Katz Commission submits its final recommendations. Gill Marcus, the deputy minister of finance, pointed out on Wednesday that some reports had already been filed, including one on capital transfer tax, which will now be put to public debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Katz Commission is also looking at land tax, benefit funds and the tax treatment of medical aid schemes, as well as the issue of source versus residence, which takes on added importance in light of the new exchange control regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other changes announced on Wednesday include the equal tax treatment of public and private sector funds, which raised a few eyebrows among the unions, with the Federation of South African Labour Unions claiming it &quot;should not be done without considering the overall remuneration packages of public servants ... Insult will be added to injury by also taxing retirement benefits which were previously tax-free for public employees&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Anne Pappenheim, tax partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche, believed the adjustment was fair and in line with recommendations of the Katz Commission, as well as the National Retirement Consultative Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17% tax on retirement funds was left unchanged, but investments by funds in unit trust schemes with property shares will now be taxed at the same rate, thereby closing an obvious loophole, says Pappenheim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party was quick to react to the scrapping of the diesel refund system, saying it was &quot;shocked&quot;. However, according to the Budget Review, the system &quot;has been open to abuse&quot;, hence the move away from direct rebates.  Derek Hannekom, the Minister of Agriculture and Land Affairs, is in talks with the unions to seek other means to assist farmers, the principal benefactors of the old system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were few surprises on fringe benefits taxation, which, as Manuel quipped, affected him too. Private use of company cars is currently taxed at 1,2% a month of the cost of the vehicle; this will rise to 1,8% netting R150- million. Travel allowances are also hit, with the limit of 12 000kms raised to 14 000kms, where accurate records of private use are not kept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the main, then, the emphasis was on more efficient collection. With the South African Revenue Service set to gain administrative autonomy any day now, it will hold final responsibility for ensuring the finance minister's revenue targets are met - along with the tax-paying public, naturally.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Trevor Manuel's finest hour: a selection of gut responses on the first Budget devised by an ANC minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATIONAL PARTY: &quot;The budget demonstrates shocking insensitivity towards the agricultural and forestry sectors of the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The budget demonstrates a shocking insensitivity towards individuals in the middle and higher-income groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP said it was shocked by the &quot;unacceptably sharp&quot; 52% increase in the excise duty on cigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also &quot;shocked that the Budget speech presented to the portfolio committee on finance was available in English only&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Freedom Front: &quot;The huge increases in excise duty on cigarettes and liquor were unacceptable and shocking,&quot; the party said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At last the government has committed itself to stick to its economic plan.  In the past, too many plans have come and gone without being carried out,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mangosuthu Buthelezi: the 1997/8 Budget was the first to take into account all of society. &quot;We have entered into the real democratic South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The South Africa Communist Party: &quot;generally&quot; welcomes the Budget, specifically the targeted tax relief for lower-income groups and the significant increase in the housing budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SACP welcomed the fact that the Budget made no provision for privatisation &quot;windfalls&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Democratic Party's finance spokesman Ken Andrew: &quot;All in all this is a Budget with a sting in the tail for ordinary taxpayers. Beneath its benign facade lie increased individual taxation, increased excise duties on a range of consumer products and no relief for people wanting to save.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DP warned of cuts in capital expenditure at a time when the country needed new roads. There was a danger that roads that were already deteriorating would collapse, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal: &quot;This money will go a long way to address the problems of internal refugees, orphans of political violence, traumatised communities, the building of houses that were destroyed during political violence etc,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Trevor Manuel's Budget speech it said: &quot;This is in stark contrast to former apartheid regimes that budgeted for the death and destruction of innocent South Africans and the peoples of Southern Africa.&quot; The ANC said it would remain the eyes and ears of the people and ensure that every cent of this money would be used for peace in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale: said Manuel's offering was &quot;prudent&quot;. The Budget showed that profound thinking had gone into its compilation and it would go a long way in increasing the confidence many people had in Manuel.  He accepted the Budget with enthusiasm for its balanced nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The South Africa Foundation: &quot;While it is unfortunate that the tax burden remains high, it was more important to meet the deficit reduction targets at this stage. But achieving higher growth targets will require further movement in tax reduction in succeeding Budgets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The South African National Civic Organisation: It accuses Manuel of bowing to pressure from big business by relaxing exchange controls, which was going to negatively affect the government's revenue. &quot;Even developed countries have exchange controls to ensure that income generated in domestically does not leave ... in huge amounts,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want to trumpet the same old song, but we must ask if it is enough to ensure that every South African is in a position to get a house which is electrified and has access to clean water in a clean, stable, healthy and peaceful environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - HOW to keep spending under control without dramatically raising taxes? Trevor Manuel seems to have managed to walk the Budget tightrope with relative ease, although next year's revisions may tell a different story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expenditure in the 1997/98 Budget increases by 6,1% over last year's revised spending total to R186 747-billion, while revenue is tipped to rise 11,1% over the revised figure for 1996/97 to R161 976-billion, leaving a Budget deficit, as stipulated in the growth, employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy, of 4,1%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important than the numbers, however, is the allocation, and true to his Gear principles, Manuel seeks to ensure redistribution is put into effect.  Thus, 55% of non-interest spending goes to the social services: R40-billion for education; R20-billion for health; R18-billion for social security and welfare; and R4-billion for housing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, R300-million is set aside for community-based poverty relief programmes, with emphasis on rural areas and helping women; social security provision is increased by R1-billion; and R75-million goes towards a flat- rate child support benefit, to replace the existing maintenance grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest beneficiary is education, winning 21,3% of total government expenditure (6,5% of gross domestic product), which is way over the international norm for developing countries but testimony to the ground that has to be made up in the wake of apartheid era inequities. Tertiary education will also gain, with R5,4-billion of the national vote of R5,5-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A big loser in this year's Budget - again - is the South African National Defence Force. Its apportionment is down 6,5%, to R9,579-billion. In the reprioritisation away from defence, however, crime prevention is high on the agenda. The South African Police Service gets 20,6% more, or R11,919-billion, while Correctional Services gets 28,1% more, R3,32-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Othe big beneficiaries are Home Affairs, with R520,4-million, which includes R93,3- million for a new identification card system; Housing, which receives R4,038- billion; and Justice, with R1,812-billion. Direct comparisons with last year's Budget allocations are misleading, however, because in the case of health, for example, expenditure programmes have been devolved to the provinces, resulting in reductions in the national Budget measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Reconstruction and Development Programme spending is provided for through the normal budgetary process, with R4,378- billion set aside this year. These projects include the primary school nutrition programme, clinic building, school building, urban renewal, and support for improving the policing and criminal justice system, including the establishment of the first victim-support centre in Port Elizabeth and community safety centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market reaction to the spending plans was favourable. Said one analyst: &quot; Without unlimited funds at his disposal, Manuel did some dextrous juggling, cutting the normal things, like defence, while still keeping within the framework of Gear. But what we'll be watching for now is that the money is effectively spent on delivery.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As expected, the Budget held few surprises. But one thing is sure, this has to be the year of delivery, writes Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TREVOR MANUEL is not the only optimist on the state of South Africa's economy: the latest edition of The Economist magazine states: &quot;A real turnaround seems to be under way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Manuel's &quot;no smoke, no mirrors&quot; Budget is designed to underpin the economy's renaissance and with it, the government's commitment to the Gear (growth, employment and redistribution) strategy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Budget Review states: &quot;Real incomes have begun to increase and a new vigour is apparent in South African industry and trade. Investments are being made with growing confidence and international opportunities are widening.  The 1997-98 Budget seeks to reinforce these trends, while continuing the expenditure reprioritisation ... initiated by the Reconstruction and Development Programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Budget deficit target of 4%, says Manuel, should not mean the end of social transformation. Expenditure will be kept down through better management controls - and &quot;a firmer hand on wish lists&quot;. The time has come for the government to demonstrate that life can be different, he said on Wednesday. &quot;It is imperative in the context of Gear to demonstrate that we are not just taking but also giving. In this context, direct transfers and social grants are very important. So the pressure will be on the South African Revenue Service to render unto Caesar what is due to Caesar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In line with Gear, Manuel is taking a medium-term approach; miracles are not on the cards. Although his growth forecast - of 2,5% - is not quite as optimistic as the Reserve Bank governor's, who considers 3% more feasible, the medium-term prospects are &quot;positive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manufacturing should benefit from supply- side measures, ensuring rapid expansion this year, while strong export growth will narrow the current account gap and greater inflows of capital will help shore up the foreign reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inflation, while higher than last year, should still come in below double- digits, but some easing is likely as domestic expenditure slows and the public sector borrowing requirement falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, so positive. There are plenty of negatives, in particular, the unemployment rate of 29% - or 4,7-million economically active people - according to the October 1995 Household Survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Manuel believes the combination of industrial, labour market and infrastructural development strategies, within a sound fiscal and financial environment, will ensure good progress on this front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, greater emphasis is placed on tax incentives for manufacturing industries and export promotion, superseding the general export incentive scheme, which will be phased out by the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small business is also targeted, with the Khula Enterprise Finance company up and running and a loans programme due to get under way this year.  Infrastructure spending is another potential job creator, with increasing use of small and medium- sized contractors and more labour-intensive construction methods. To this end, a total of R19-billion has been earmarked for the principal projects - road construction, water provision, support for agriculture and industrial promotion programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With these programmes, Manuel has managed to satisfy two different constituents, business and labour, while keeping the promises made in Gear and still following the aims of the Reconstruction and Development Programme.  While it held few surprises - in terms of the parameters set out in Gear, the minister had little room to manoeuvre - it nonetheless marks a turning point: this, finally, has to be the year of delivery.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Finance minister Trevor Manuel this week took the bit between his teeth and announced a sweeping relaxation of exchange controls, much to the delight of the markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The changes in the exchange control regime ... are profound,&quot; Manuel said in his Budget address on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a joint statement with Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals, Manuel said that the country's balance of payments situation and its involvement in the forward market &quot;make it impractical to permit unlimited transfers of capital at this stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give the economy time to adjust and avoid unnecessary volatility, certain limits will remain but the emphasis will increasingly be on the positive aspects of prudential financial supervision.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he did not fear a rush of money out of the country because of the changes, Manuel admitted there was a risk, &quot;but the reality is that there is a heck of a lot of money out there that left when it wanted to&quot;. He did not seem to believe it would all vanish abroad overnight. The concessions made on exchange controls since 1994 had resulted in R18-billion being invested abroad, while asset swap transactions worth R30-billion have been approved, of which about R17-billion have taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lifting of exchange controls began in 1994, when a final debt rescheduling agreement was reached with foreign creditors, bringing to an end the debt standstill arrangements in place under apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1995, the financial rand was abolished and the restrictions on the repatriation of non-resident funds were removed. In 1996, some institutional investors were allowed to invest up to 3% of their net inflow of funds abroad as long as these were limited to 10% of their total assets. At the same time, companies were allowed to invest abroad according to certain limits and the regulations covering exchange control generally were eased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Manuel and Stals indicated that a further relaxation would take place with, for the first time, significant concessions for residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main features of the changes are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* virtually all remaining limits on current account transactions will be maximum of R80 000 per person (against R6 000 now) of 12 years and older and R25 000 per child under 12 years each year with no daily limit;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* exchange control approval will no longer be needed to buy computer packages on a commercial basis or import newspapers, books, magazines, medicines, stamps and correspondence course material;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the threshold on foreign shareholdings in companies that face no limits on local borrowing will be increased to 50% from 25%;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* South African companies will be allowed to retain foreign currency earnings for up to 30 days, rather than seven days;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the amount that South African companies can transfer abroad for approved investments will be increased from R20- million to R30-million, and up to R50- million for approved projects in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) - excluding Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, which are part of the South African Customs Union within which money flows freely;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* companies with approved projects abroad will be able to raise offshore loans based on their local balance sheets, which implies recourse to South Africa in the event of a default. They will also be able to invest some of their assets abroad, based on audited balance sheets, for portfolio investments;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* institutions will be able to invest a further 3% of their net inflow of funds abroad this year and an extra 2% of funds may be invested in stock exchanges in SADC countries;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* South African residents &quot;in good standing&quot; older than 18 years will be allowed to invest a limited amount of capital abroad and invest in property in SADC states. Details will be announced before July. They could alternatively hold foreign currency deposits with authorised exchange dealers if they did not want to invest abroad. There will be no controls over how income earned from foreign sources is used, but this did not apply to earnings from exports which had to be returned to the country in 30 days.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Trevor Manuel's first Budget confounded his critics and pleased the markets, reports Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) has long called for a champion to lead the government's growth, employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy. On Wednesday, it looked like one had been found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Finance, Trevor Manuel dubbed his first Budget the &quot; transformation&quot; Budget, which sets out to deliver a &quot;better life for all&quot;. A tall order, but judging by the market reaction, not unattainable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manuel has managed to walk the fiscal tightrope and not lose his balance,&quot; said one economist. &quot;He's done a pretty good job considering the constraints he faces,&quot; said another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were complaints, of course. Sacob was keen on some measures to boost savings and to correct the imbalance between direct and indirect taxation.  Instead, we got some adjustment for bracket creep in the lower income groups but value-added tax (VAT) remains unchanged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, some economists raised the point that now would have been the best time to lift the VAT rate: &quot;The political acceptability of a VAT hike lessens the closer we get to 1999,&quot; said Abri Meiring of Old Mutual. &quot;It makes more sense to help the poor through expenditure than through income tax measures.  As long as some compensation is introduced, in the form of food stamps, for example, VAT is the most productive form of tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another bugbear was privatisation. Says Sacob: &quot;Business ... would argue that in addition to the state-owned enterprises themselves, numerous activities of the public sector can be examined in order to determine whether they can be more effectively undertaken by the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Manuel went a long way in silencing most of his potential critics with the &quot;philosophical shift&quot;, as he called it, on exchange controls.  Essentially what we have now is a free exchange control regime with a few exceptions, against a regulated system with no exceptions, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, depending on how this move goes, it won't be long before total freedom reigns. &quot;We're in the second half of the race now,&quot; said Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank. &quot;When we get to the last lap we can run much faster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while welcomed in principle, the lack of detail raised concerns. Dennis Dykes, chief economist of Nedcor, said uncertainty about what the limits would be when finally decided on in June could lead to unnecessary volatility in the currency markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations will be subject to prudential requirements, in line with practice overseas. In Britain, for example, pension funds are only allowed to invest 10% of their assets outside the country. But only individual taxpayers of &quot;good standing&quot; will be allowed to take advantage of the new measures - another sideswipe at the non-payers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody expects a massive capital flight to ensue after July 1, however. The limit for individual foreign currency transactions is likely to be in line with the new R80 000 travel allowance. And the limits will be re-evaluated as circumstances demand and reserves permit, said Manuel. First off, the administrative issues have to be dealt with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was what the market wanted - a clear signal that South Africa is well on its way to becoming a fully-fledged member of the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this Budget was not just about lifting exchange controls. Manuel pounded home his message of stopping the &quot;non-payment rot&quot; time and again. &quot; Our ability to (ensure equity and fairness in the tax system) is severely hampered by the culture of non- payment and evasion that has come to characterise our tax system. Non-payers and tax-evaders ... stand in the way of significant tax reform and relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government will more vigorously enforce the tax legislation,&quot; he said.  &quot;We will actively pursue anyone who breaks the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with the latest figures from the tax amnesty showing a disappointing R900- million received, albeit with VAT figures yet to come, Manuel will have to do all in his power to make sure his Budget balances.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Enriched uranium once intended for South Africa's nuclear weapons is now helping medical science, writes Lesley Cowling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC) is using enriched uranium to fuel a research reactor that now produces medical isotopes for international export and local use. But the uranium was enriched in a process designed by AEC scientists in the Seventies for a very different purpose - as the fuel for South Africa's nuclear bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like converting swords into ploughshares,&quot; says AEC's chief Dr Waldo Stumpf. But critics say the new process may be costing South Africa more money than it is worth and that AEC is motivated by an instinct for survival rather than a desire for peace and harmony.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumpf was appointed head of AEC in 1989 by FW de Klerk's government and given the responsibility of dismantling the nuclear weapons programme so that South Africa could become a signatory to the Non-Nuclear Proliferation Treaty.  For at least two decades before that, AEC scientists had been enriching uranium for use in nuclear devices being created by Armscor in the top secret programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AEC nuclear scientists of the time claimed to have invented the enrichment process, but scientific critics said that, in fact, they used a German designed process and simply adapted it. The process was developed for political and strategic reasons, and money was not the issue. It was therefore not at all cost effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumpf says it took about two years to dismantle the programme and transfer the enriched uranium from Armscor back to AEC, where it was stored in a special vault. South Africa signed the treaty in July 1991, but then the issue of the enriched uranium arose: what to do with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story goes that the Americans offered to take it off our hands and were none too pleased when South Africa decided to keep it. Stumpf does not confirm this anecdote, which is floating about in scientific circles. He would only say the Americans &quot;put out feelers&quot;, but there was no legal obligation for South Africa to hand over the uranium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Americans wanted the enriched uranium because of a concern for proliferation, not because they wanted to use it - as one person described it: &quot;They want to sit on the world's nuclear weapons and they don't want anyone else to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumpf says that the South African government of the time felt it was responsible enough to take care of the uranium, a position the present dispensation has also taken. The AEC now stores it according to International Atomic Energy Agency guidelines. The agency inspects the premises frequently and has installed cameras to monitor any movement of the uranium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Thomas Auf der Heyde, director of the University of Cape Town's Science Advice Unit, says AEC needed to hold onto the uranium to secure its position in the new South Africa. &quot;Everybody can see that it's in AEC's interests to hold onto the uranium - it raises its political stake considerably. It is also a partial justification of its existence, at least as the managers of the uranium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AEC began using the stockpiled uranium in the Nineties as fuel for its research reactor - known as Safari - at a time when the corporation was trying to diversify its activities and to become more commercially viable. At this stage, AEC began producing medical isotopes and created a company to market them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical isotopes are used as diagnostic and therapeutic tools - in simple terms, they are substances, usually liquid, that give off a low level of radiation. When swallowed by patients or inserted into the body, they can be seen by doctors using special scanning equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They can also be used to treat cancer, as they can be made to attack tumours from inside the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new exploitation of enriched uranium is one of the projects AEC uses to justify its existence in economic terms. But some take issue with this. Auf der Heyde says that it is possible that AEC's isotopes are generating significant income for the corporation. But it is also possible that the running costs of the reactor are so high that the process is uneconomic and that AEC is using its government funding to subsidise the reactor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There may be other reasons for running the reactor, research and capacity building, for example, but the figures are not available,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But AEC representative Mojalefa Murphy says that producing medical isotopes is a by- product of running the reactor and its main function is actually to release neutrons for research and not to produce the isotopes. &quot;Medical isotopes are not a profit-making activity anywhere in the world, but they can defray a reactor's operating costs,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murphy argues strongly that there is a need for South Africa to remain involved in the hi-tech world of nuclear research, and not to leave that to the more developed countries. &quot;There's a need to supply energy for South Africa in the future and that requires research.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AEC faces tough competition in the medical isotopes market from the states of the former Soviet Union, which are producing very cheap nuclear products.  Russian medical isotopes could also become available locally, but AEC's privileged position in South Africa would make it very difficult for any new competitor to enter the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of profitability is likely to be resolved later this year, when a fundamental review of South Africa's science and technology system, mandated by the recent White Paper, takes place. AEC will be one of the insititutions assessed. According to Rob Adam, deputy director- general of the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, the terms of reference of the review would definitely include the profitability of such institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murphy says the AEC has diversified into a number of areas in the last five years, developing a whole range of new products, but that there is a need for the corporation to work with government to develop a focus. &quot;We're in the process of clarifying the mandate of the AEC,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process is hampered by a lack of trust, commentators say - government mistrust of AEC's past and the corporation's fears about its future. &quot;Once we can be accepted as legitimate role-players in building the new South Africa, we can become more effective,&quot; says Murphy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African artists continue to exist in a cultural vacuum that gives too little recognition too late, writes Hazel Friedman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE is an ancient Greek proverb that says the soul of a nation will be judged by the way it treats its artists. If this is so, then South Africa has much to answer for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blame it on apartheid which decreed that the fruits of black South African labour would be cheap and expendable. Blame it on economic deprivation that forced struggling artists into other activities and eroded their spirit.  Blame it on the smug complacency of a gallery system that favoured the tried, the tame and the tested. And the museums whose paltry budgets were matched by impaired vision. Blame it also on the dearth of a culture of art criticism and the also-ran status conferred on South African art by an ill- informed public who still believes that art comes from an exotic place called overseas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The litany of accusations is endless. And justified. The inescapable fact is that when one examines the flimsily woven fabric of South African art history, the seams unravel, revealing a history of neglect, exploitation and - in certain cases - irretrievable loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now art dealer Warren Siebrits has curated an exhibition which helps to fill some of the gaping crevices in South African art history over the past few decades. He has achieved this on a smaller (but no less laudable) scale to the seminal The Neglected Tradition exhibition curated at the Johannesburg Art Gallery by Steven Sack in 1988. And he has succeeded in putting an heroic human face onto South African art history by acknowledging the undimmed creative spirit that survives, even in the face of adversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the title of the exhibition suggests, Confluence brings together different streams of art making over the last 40 or so years by artists who, for one reason or another, have been marginalised by the mainstream. There is no attempt to bracket the artists in neat defining categories, nor to clump them into a single &quot;struggle&quot; camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the majority of artists represented on the exhibition are black and self-taught, Siebrits has included white academically trained artists - many of whom, such as Jane Alexander, Willem Boshoff and Kendell Geers, are achieving acclaim initially denied them by an inherently conservative art network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are among the more fortunate. The overwhelming majority of names on show belong to that pantheon of artists who have received too little too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerard Sekoto, who died in 1993, is now regarded - whether accurately or not -- as the father of South African painting. Yet his life epitomised the contradictory standards applied to black and white artists during apartheid.  Although the source of his artmaking was derived from childhood activities, like many of his peers, he received some formal art education, and as an urban artist gained access to current methods and languages of artmaking. Yet he remained caught in the racial vice that demanded demanded a racial stereotype, that black artists be kept &quot;unspoilt&quot; and separated from their white counterparts, even in exhibition catalogues. In 1947, he paid his own way to Paris, where - shortly after a major retrospective of his work was held in South Africa - he died alone, impoverished and in exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dumile Feni also suffered from the twin blades of oppression: neglect and exploitation. And of course, posthumous acclaim. Widely regarded as the Goya of the townships and the master of violent turbulent imagery, he was working during the1960s and 1970s when the apartheid grip had tightened to a stranglehold. Constantly harassed by the authorities for refusing to conform to South Africa's whitewashed ideology, he left the country in the 1970s along with fellow artists Gavin Jantes and Louis Maqhubela. He died in exile in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of his departure, many artist- activists - among them Winston Saoli, Lionel Davis and Fikile (Magadledla)- were detained. And a number of extraordinarily promising artists died young and tragically, among them Cyprian Shilakoe and Julian Motau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, early examples of works by Dumile Feni, Cyprian Shilakoe and Fikile were unearthed by Siebrits. In the case of Saoli, who recently died a penniless alcoholic, there appears to be no trace of his earlier output. The only place he has been assigned is to the growing ranks of the lost generation of unsung cultural heroes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Pemba travelled a less lonely path than some of his counterparts.  Today he is alive and living in the Eastern Cape. At the age of 85 - although crippled - he continues to paint. And at last he is receiving accolades, in the form of national retrospectives and a book, by journalist Sarah Huddleston, which chronicles his struggle for recognition. Yet the principal benefactors of his labours remain - not Pemba himself - but his dealers, the Everard Read Gallery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Gladys Mgudlandlu, she painted her expressionistic landscapes at a time when black women's work was strictly &quot;maid in South Africa&quot;. Today, 17 years after her death, she is regarded as something of a pioneer, among the few who remember her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the history of neglect in South Africa has not been colour-specific, nor has it been solely politically inspired. Charles Argent - also known as the &quot;bus ticket&quot; artist - was using conceptualism as a strategy as far back as the mid-Fifties. He was inevitably alienated by the conservative art establishment because of his unorthodox ways, and an exhibition of his works held at the Edenvale Public Library was closed down by the police. Argent left South Africa in the 1960s and died in 1982. Today, even though he was in many ways the progenitor of conceptualism in this country, in the official art history bibles his name is mentioned almost as an afterthought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were few who encapsulated the country's madness more poignantly than artist and poet, Wopko Jensma. Although he too exerted a powerful influence on his artistic peers and progeny alike, by 1988 he was living in the Salvation Army Hostel in downtown Johannesburg. The hostel burned down in 1994. To this day no-one knows whether or not Jensma survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to whom does one turn to secure the survival of SouthAfrica's eroded?  The forces of government? &quot;History has the ability to talk to us,&quot; said Lionel Mtshali, Minister of Arts Culture, Science and Technology during a recent interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our duty to listen and learn from its lessons. But the local art world might be hard of hearing. Admittedly, the new political dispensation has promised to yield the fruits of change in all spheres of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the arts are no exception. Hoisting the flags of cultural transformation are the White Paper on Arts and Culture, released in June 1996, and the formation of the National Arts Council to oversee the funding of deserving cultural projects. It goes without saying that speedy funding will lead to the growth of cultural centres. With facilities come workshops teaching practical skills, and with teaching comes the prospect of generating a society that does not relegate art and artists to the lowest rung on the national priority ladder - as has sadly always been the case. And government fumbling has hampered the process of transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the signature of the new South Africa might have changed, it still bears the stains of old ink. The art world remains governed by a clique of curators, critics and galleries determining access to and ownership of art.  And in many respects the galleries and official art institutions have spawned a selfish culture of &quot;startists&quot; intent on maintaining a foothold in the here and now of SouthAfrica's flavour of the month status. And in the process, many of the less visible, vocal artists remain sidelined or simply ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another country, artists of the ilk mentioned above would be f ted and toasted. In South Africa they have to become household names on someone else's turf before being accorded a similar respect on their own. Or they live fast, die young and leave a good-looking myth behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why it is so essential for South African art to nurture a culture of criticism and research. One day we will be forced to ask a similar question to the one posed by playwright Athol Fugard: Who are we? Where do we come from? What time is it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By then the answer to all of the above might be: who knows?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Dear Walter,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE of the advantages of travel is that it gives one a fresh perspective on life. Or so I thought as we winged our way back from South East Asia at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do we complicate our lives, I demanded of Parks as we eagerly broke open the picnic hampers donated to us for the flight by the Malaysians? Why can't we run our affairs like the Sultan of Brunei? An average national income of $15000 a head and none of them has ever done a day's work. No tax returns to labour over. And his 1788-room palace!! With quarters like that I could have kept Evelyn, Winnie and Gra a on the payroll. I could rustle up so much space for Jacob that our health minister would never need know that she was part of a harem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alas the dreams of an easier way of life were quickly dispelled as we disembarked at Waterkloof and I was bowled over by a scrum of cabinet ministers all shouting for my attention. Our prisons minister, demanding the presidential imprimatur for his proposal to stuff traffic offenders down mineshafts. Our justice minister, demanding my signature to a government statement declaring Alan Boesak innocent of all charges in case the trial judge gets it wrong. Our defence minister, demanding pay increases for all poisoners on the state payroll before they take industrial action and poison the lot of us .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I switched off my hearing aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, the joys of modern technology! A flick of the switch and it is as if one has been transported to an aquarium, watching curiously shaped fish blowing bubbles from behind the plate glass window. And people wonder why I so often have a beatific grin on my face!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alack, it is no protection against Joe Nhlanlha. And sure enough our spy minister - who has sworn such a terrible oath of silence for fear of letting secrets drop in a garrulous moment - hove in sight wringing his hands in a gesture which, as any student of braille well knows, means &quot;head for the life- boats&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five minutes later we were in the nuclear bunker under Ammunition Hill where I traditionally retire in times of national crisis. En route, in the back of the presidential limousine, Joe had managed by a hurried game of charades to convey the nature of the emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It transpired that his top agent, code- named Ms Swart Gevaar, had given her life to deliver the names of five spies for the apartheid government who were now members of the South African cabinet. Impaled on the aerial of an Aston Martin at the culmination of an obligatory car chase she had, in her dying moments, managed to scrawl the names using invisible ink brewed to a formula Joe had found in an old Beano comic and distributed to his most valued agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the nuclear bunker Joe produced a grimy piece of paper. A technician rushed in with a candle. With due solemnity Joe lit it and began waving the paper over the flame. We were straining forward to see the names appear when Joe sneezed, the paper caught fire and burned to a crisp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aghast we gazed each other. We had lost the Last Great Secret of the Apartheid Era!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A danger exsists that the 'national interest' will be used as an excuse to silence the new government's critics, argues Peter Vale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHOW me the national interest and I'll show you a politician's trick. When Ronnie Kasrils evoked the national interest to defend the sheltered employment of Wouter Basson, I had a flashback to the 1980s when - with regular monotony -the use of the national interest aimed to silence all the government's critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As used by Kasrils, the message was as clear as it might have been a decade ago - because Basson once protected the national interest, it was the duty of the national interest to protect the information he held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This unhappy episode suggests how quickly those who serve in the Mandela government have turned to the clich'd explanations of national security which have served executive power in South Africa so effectively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, the mindless rantings against the communists are long gone and, mercifully, the endless perforation of the country's borders - to destabilise innocent people in the name of Western civilisation - has ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But carefully listen to security-speak, and you'll hear more continuities than change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is this so? Why is it that the ideas which make for the national interest have survived border wars, township violence, negotiation and transition better than most others in the country's political lexicon?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing South Africa's &quot;miracle&quot; masked innumerable continuities in public policy: while everything seemed up for grabs, many core areas of national life - especially in a delicate but deadly field like national security - were immutable. Dislodging this has proved devilishly difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the transition, for instance, the space to contest understandings around the old and the new was crowded out by the trade-off between white fears and black demands. Then as the country drew together in celebration, not too many dissenting voices were to be heard amongst the cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a deeper level, the discourse around national interest has been carried into the new South Africa by continuities within the policy community. With too few exceptions, those who are shaping the debate on national security issues are working from the same script which - a short decade ago - determined that South Africa's national interest was best served by mounting a total war against the Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To write this is neither ungracious nor unkind; it is, rather, a warning against the numbing power of security pundits. Each time an &quot;expert&quot; speaks, we need to recall that their most feverish warnings against Soviet power occurred at the very moment when that system was tottering towards total collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While changes on the ground have shifted the interest of this community towards new security issues - drugs, small arms, international crime and regional migration - the logic which determines their opinions has not changed; neither has their language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listen to the most &quot;informed&quot; opinions on Mozambican migrants, and you'll hear the very clauses which were once reserved for the Marxists in Maputo. Or deconstruct the public discourse on international drugs, and you will find all the linkages which sustained the infamous total onslaught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given this, is it any wonder that Hannah Arendt wryly said of security experts: &quot;The trouble is not that they are paid to think the 'unthinkable', the trouble is that they don't think!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how are we to think about the national interest? Or, put in another sense: what is the national interest? Can the public be freed from its blinding tyranny?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overriding rule is this - where we sit on the idea of national interest depends not only on where we stand but who we are. This is because the idea of the national interest is not fixed in stone. There are no lasting ideas which might be shared by all South Africans until the end of time; no enduring concerns which might run deep into the next millennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interests - including national ones - depend both on needs and wants; not surprisingly, calculating these depend on understandings about how the world works. And these understandings are unpinned by different sets of values so, if truth be told, there is probably a separate interest for each South African national!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national interest is contingent on a myriad of factors, only one of which is identity - that thorny issue that few South Africans really want to think about wrapped, as they now are, in the comforting folds of the new flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without locating these critical perspectives at its base, the term national interest has no analytical value at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To their great shame, South Africa's security community, blinded now by the lights of international acceptance, have refused to see this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the hand of politicians, however, the national interest is a powerful tool which is why governments - and South Africa is no exception - evoke the idea to draw citizens to a central position. By minimising differences between antagonistic positions; by setting high-sounding goals which lie beyond the immediate political horizon, criticism can be silenced. Its purpose, as the Wouter Basson case suggests, is invariably to serve incumbent power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubting its efficacy, which is what Kasrils calculated. After all, what full-blooded supporter of Bafana-Bafana would want to oppose - or even raise questions about -- the national interest of the rainbow nation?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* OOM KRISJAN'S juices no longer flow like the mighty Limpopo, but in my day I gave the noois a good run for their money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why I can't understand what's up with the ou toppies at Stellenbosch University. Its director of student affairs, Piet du Plessis, has asked all the student councils and the SRC to give him their opinions on five burning issues. They are: student misuse of alcohol on campus; student misuse of alcohol off campus; the use of coarse language by students; immoral dress of a sexual nature; and blatant vandalism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ag come on ou man, what's the average age of the students and how many of them are away from their parents for the first time? Forgotten what it was like when you were young?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where's the beef?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* NONE of the manne in the Dorsbult Bar are frequent flyers, unless of course we've had too much mampoer. But judging from the stories we heard from a weary traveller this week, South African Airways has taken all the fun out of flying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our traveller flew from Cape Town to Jo'burg on Sunday and arrived two hours late. The flight back to Cape Town on Tuesday morning was also delayed for two hours because SAA's computers were down and everything had to be done manually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the flight was delayed because they had to count the passengers.  Then they had to check that all the passengers on the plane really wanted to go to Cape Town. But the final straw for our gatvol passenger was when they delayed the plane even longer when they realised there wasn't enough food on board for everybody. Only after the passengers voted loudly to share their breakfast sausages with each other did the flight crew finally give the green light for take-off. These people take their wors seriously jong!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* TREVOR MANUEL didn't come into the Dorsbult Bar this week for advice, that's for sure. We don't understand finance, and we're finding it even harder to understand South African business. Listen to Sasol, the company the old government gave billions of rands in subsidies so we could say wela to the oil embargo. Explaining their new black empowerment policy, they say &quot;we realise the necessity to establish an independent, economically viable oil company with fully empowered black businessmen to serve the needs of the greater South African community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't understand what empowered businessmen are. We also don't understand who Sasol was serving in the past with our tax money. Can you explain it, Trevor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's in a name?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* THERE'S one politician this week, though, who explains things in a way even professional beer drinkers can understand. Helen Suzman was on Max du Preez's show Q&amp;A this week, explaining what liberals were. A member of the audience said liberals were &quot;people who love black people better than black people love themselves&quot;. &quot;Rubbish,&quot; said Helen. &quot;I can be just as nasty to black people as white people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Headlines in some South African newspapers this week - &quot; Madiba back from Asia with billions&quot; - reflect the obsession South Africa has with the quick fix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with massive social problems the country longs for a magic formula, or simply a magician, to conjure up instant solutions. The Sultan of Brunei is the richest man in the world ... maybe Mandela can persuade him to give us some. Let's get rid of crime - we'll throw the perpetrators down mineshafts.  There is something almost adolescent about such fantasies; a failure to understand the lesson of maturity, that slow and steady wins the race.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a principle which is being demonstrated at the moment, although perhaps not appreciated, in the field of broadcasting. The acceptance of the McKinsey recommendations, to slash some 1 400 jobs at the SABC, points to the depths of the crisis in the public broadcasting service. But while the SABC has reduced itself to a state of near collapse - with a succession of naively ambitious policy decisions, such as the refocusing of SAFM - the Independent Broadcasting Authority has been slowly and steadily reshaping the face of South African broadcasting with what promises to be impressive results</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The achievements of the authority in its three years of existence have been considerable. Creating more than 100 community radio stations, selling off six SABC stations and licensing seven new commercial stations, they have literally opened the airwaves to the people. The diversity of interests for which they promise to cater is staggering: classical music, jazz, youth, Muslims, Christians, conservationists (a dedicated station in the Kruger Park) , Chinese, Greek, Portuguese, Arabic (not to mention the 11 national languages), right-wingers, left- wingers, the residents of Botshabello, Winterveld ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - So, the first black finance minister presented his first Budget and the sky did not fall in. After a year of faux pas and financial market fiascos, Trevor Manuel did the impossible: he nigh on pleased all of the people, at least for a few hours. Parliament applauded, and the markets rewarded him with a firmer rand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expectations were plentiful, surprises not. He tinkered here, tweaked there, but within the confines of the government's macro- economic strategy, there was very little room for fiscal latitude. But still he managed to shift the emphasis from taking to giving and kick-start the growth, employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that, in essence, clinched Manuel's successful debut. The spending numbers and tax changes pale into insignificance beside the all-important confidence-booster provided by his - and the government's - commitment to implementation and delivery, while keeping a tight rein on spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel has the economy and investors' goodwill on his side. The macro- economic scenario is favourable; growth, while not breathtaking, is adequate to provide a solid base on which to build in the next decade. Inflation is at its lowest in more than 20 years, the rand has stabilised and foreign reserves are looking healthier. All factors that enabled Manuel to present a bolder Budget than his predecessors, particularly with respect to easing exchange control regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Manuel's Budget wasn't just about making the headlines; there are measures to support small business, public works programmes, poverty relief, and to encourage investment and tax efficiency. And all the time the message of reprioritisation was hammered home - a &quot;better life for all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all the doom and gloom of 1996 it would seem churlish to cast doubts on such a positive Budget. But joblessness remains South Africa's biggest problem; while some public works programmes were announced, they are insufficient to make a serious dent in the current rate of unemployment.  Relying on investment incentives alone to boost private-sector job creation will not do the trick. And then there's the problem of leaving implementation up to the provinces, which could lead to capacity problems and growing inequities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, the African National Congress had a lot riding on this Budget, the first for which it was solely responsible. They are deserving of our congratulations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Rebels are advancing on Zaire's third- largest city but sceptics in the West are resisting France's calls for an intervention force, writes Chris McGreal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRANCE is pursuing a lonely campaign to revive plans for an international force in Zaire to halt the rebel advance and prevent what it says is a genocide in the making. But sceptics in Washington and Europe doubt the accusations of widespread massacres of refugees, and question French motives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With rebels rapidly advancing on Kisangani, Zaire's third-largest city, Paris is stepping up its efforts to win United Nations backing for a foreign force to halt the fighting. It says it is concerned for hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees who it claims are being systematically murdered by the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France's humanitarian aid minister, Xavier Emmanuelli, renewed the accusation on Monday after a visit to refugees fleeing eastern Zaire. &quot; Without organised and secure aid, men, women and children are condemned to die of hunger, exhaustion, illness or to be killed by those who have been chasing them for more than three months,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But UN and other foreign officials say that no massacre sites have been uncovered, nor have witnesses or survivors come forward with convincing accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris argues that Rwanda's Tutsi army invaded Zaire in an attempt to exterminate Hutu refugees before Rwanda resettles Tutsis in a divided Zaire.  France accuses Uganda of joining the invasion, and other countries in the region of supporting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there is little doubt that Rwanda invaded Zaire last October, France's critics say the war is now a civil conflict because the rebels are mainly Zaireans and have won support among their compatriots in their war against President Mobutu Sese Seko's 31-year dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a visit to Zaire last week by the Dutch co-operation minister, Jan Pronk, a Dutch official accused Paris of denying reality. &quot;The French refuse to allow any talk of the Zairean conflict as internal,&quot; he said. &quot;Paris only wants it discussed in terms of a foreign invasion. That way it can justify foreign intervention to prop up what it sees as a pro-French government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Kisangani seemed poised to fall this week. Even the Zairean army barely bothers to hide its resignation to defeat. The airport is awash with the wives and children of soldiers trying to scramble on to the last flights before the rebels arrive. The poor clutter the pounding Congo river in hundreds of dug-out canoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The region's governor, Lombeya Bosongo, would like to join the exodus. But the army has twice prevented him from leaving Kisangani, fearing it would signal the final abandonment by central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Lombeya puts on a brave face and claims that despite the rebels sweeping successes over the past five months they will meet their match in his dilapidated city. &quot;They wanted to take Kisangani for a long time. They've claimed several times to have taken it. But we are still here and we will defend the city,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels claim to have surrounded the capital of northern Zaire. The army says the insurgents are still 50km away. Either way, the government's desperation is showing. Last week, it reversed itself and agreed to a UN peace plan in the hope of winning an immediate ceasefire. At the weekend, rebel leader Laurent Kabila also agreed in principal to the UN proposals for negotiations and elections. But he again ruled out a ceasefire until Mobutu and the government agree to quit. In the meantime, Kabila's forces press on toward the once grand city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire might face resistance as it moves on its biggest prize yet, there are few in Kisangani who think the army will fight for long. The army operations commander in the city, General Kalume Numbi, appears to be putting his faith more in luck than reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Something could change, just like that, and the Zairean army will be victorious,&quot; he said. But all the signs are that he is preparing for defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, military equipment crowded into the airport and city ahead of an army counteroffensive the government promised would be devastating and final. Within days the rebels had subdued the attack as they continued their inexorable advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighter bombers, flown by Ukranian pilots, have been moved to other airfields. Only three Russian combat helicopters remain. Many of the vaunted mercenaries - mostly Serbs in whom the government put such hope of reversing the rebels fortunes - have slunk away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often the greatest resistance to the rebels has been put up by soldiers of Rwanda's defeated Hutu army, which retreated into Zaire three years ago after committing genocide against Tutsis. But while the Hutus have most to fight for - because further defeat might mean extermination or return to imprisonment in Rwanda - even they appear to be losing heart after their top two commanders fled Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those Serb mercenaries who have not left help keep order, sometimes brutally, among Zairean soldiers who pillaged and raped as they retreated into Kisangani. Only determined resistance by some residents, and the despatch of disciplined troops from Kinshasa, halted a similar rampage through the city. Hundreds of soldiers deserted..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Kisangani residents such as Lili, a woman trader who won a precious seat on a flight at the weekend, fear the army will embark on a final bout of mayhem before it pulls out. &quot;There is an air of panic. Everybody with the means is trying to get out. People are not scared of Kabila. They are scared of the trouble which war brings,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its desperate bid to win international support, the Zairean government is making a bizarre attempt to portray its struggle as a noble cause. Tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees are scattering ahead of the Alliance advance. Lombeya accuses the outside world of standing by while the rebels, who include a significant number of Tutsis, slaughter Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must defend Kisangani not only to defend the town but to protect these refugees who the world has watched being massacred in silence,&quot; Lombeya said.  &quot;The rebels have come to kill the refugees systematically. When they kill, they hide the corpses. That's why we're now discovering the mass graves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalume claims as many as 50 000 refugees have been killed by the insurgents, although he offers no evidence. Even if mass graves exist, it is unlikely the army discovered them as it only ever surrenders territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisangani's residents marvel at Lombeya's newfound concern for human welfare. Mobutu's cronies have rarely shown such interest in the wellbeing of Zaire's citizens as they filled their pockets while the country sank deeper into misery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zaire's elite grew wealthier, Kisangani declined even more than most of the country. As Zaire's third largest city, it once prospered as a major port trading in coffee and other crops. But long before the civil war, cars gave way to bicycles. The river barges carrying fuel came less and less frequently. There are so few vehicles that plants flourish in the giant potholes littered along Kisangani's streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two bouts of military-led looting earlier this decade compounded Kisangani's despair. Half its population left. The rich and educated mostly went to Kinshasa. The poor headed for the forest in the hopes of at least carving out a plot and a living, or getting a lucky break and finding diamonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unable to provide even the most basic services, the old authorities largely fell into irrelevance. Communities within the city took charge of their own lives, running courts on traditional lines and schools by paying teachers with food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a brief moment the war breathed new life into the bedraggled city. The arrival of Zaire's creaking war machine restored the old authority in Kisangani. But it was fleeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diamond business has finally dried up. The river barges no longer come.  The army ensures that the cellular phone network still functions so the high command can stay in touch. But the brewery has closed and food stocks are running low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Kalume's side, one of his officers offers an opinion. &quot;All we are asking for is to be left in peace,&quot; he said. It is a desire which echoes with Kisangani's residents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Botswana government has dismissed as &quot;lies&quot; reports from Bushmen in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve that they are being pressured to leave their ancestral lands with verbal promises of hard cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The permanent secretary in the Ministry of Lands, Elridge Mhlauli, said this week that he was still in the process of answering written questions on the allegations. In the meantime he would only say: &quot;These people, what they are saying deep down they know it is not the truth. It's a similar thing to when they went all over America and Europe.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But villagers insist that government officers are playing one settlement in the reserve off against another in an effort to get people to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I finally signed for removal against my will. I was told I was the only one who hadn't signed,&quot; said one villager at a workshop held in Xade in December. &quot;According to our culture, when you move someone you are moving for your funeral ... it is as if you are being moved to your graveyard,&quot; said another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other speakers said they had been made to move from Ghanzi to West Hanahai in the late 1970s with promises of a better life that, instead, turned into poverty, alcoholism and hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am living proof of what happens when you move,&quot; said one man who pleaded with villagers to stay inside the reserve which was set up in 1961 for &quot;wild Bushmen&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Xade, the largest village, only seven people have agreed to move out and they are reportedly now being used to convince the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Kgeikani Kweni, The First People of the Kalahari, at the December workshop, 90% of the villagers said they didn't want to move and five Xade families, who had earlier signed up to relocate, then changed their minds. They say even a recent government report agrees that 68% of the people don't want to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Through the grapevine we hear that people are being promised enough money to buy two cars and still be able to build a house with the rest,&quot; says Roy Sesana who last year attended the United Nations High Commission on Racism, where the late John Hardbattle announced that people were to be forcibly removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the removal didn't take place, members of the First People say the situation is tearing people apart psychologically and that the cash offers are not being made through the proper channels, for example through the Chief or village development committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, people are being offered different amounts, some saying they have been promised houses, others several thousand pula in cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this, the overwhelming majority say they have no intention of going.  While 13 people have left Mothomelo and one family has moved out of Kikau, The First People say no one has signed up in Metsiamanong, Gope or Gugama. - Okavango Observer</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the capital of Madagascar, Antananarivo, thousands of children live on the streets. Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world and the capital sees the extremes of its poverty. The children, some as young as six months old, survive in gangs of 30 or so. Some sleep in skips or in road tunnels; most scavenge for food among the city's rubbish.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children in a particular gang look out for each other and subsist by doing small, menial jobs in the marketplace, by begging, stealing or by prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Madagascan government, keen to encourage tourism to the island, has recently come up with a solution to the ever-growing mass of children on its capital's streets. It has set up a special police department. The department organises nightly raids known as rafles during which children sleeping rough are collected in wagons. Some of the children are then sent to private detention centres. The rest - those suspected of criminal activity, of &quot; delinquency&quot; or &quot;theft&quot; - are committed to prison. There is no trial; their sentences commonly last for three or four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madagascan prisons which officially take children only over the age of 13 are brutal establishments. Financed by the state, they tend to be run by ex- prisoners who, having finished their sentences, are encouraged to become wardens. The wardens operate a reign of terror. They take the majority of the food destined for the prisoners and maintain &quot;law and order&quot; with clubs, knives and sticks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one prison we visited, Prison d'Antanimora, the children were required to give their guardians weekly cadeaux of 100 Madagascan francs; failure to do so resulted in them having to stand for days on end within the confines of a circle chalked on the prison floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no minimum age for children who are held in private detention centres in Antananarivo; as a consequence, many of the inmates are as young as five or six. These places tend to be run by local families, who force the children to work - in glass factories or in chicken farms or in some cases as prostitutes, selling themselves by night and returning to their &quot;home&quot; by day - and then collect money for them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Frederick Chiluba and Kenneth Kaunda are allegedly involved in a deal to quash court cases involving their nationality. Anthony Kunda reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZAMBIAN President Frederick Chiluba and former president Kenneth Kaunda are allegedly involved in secret negotiations which could result in the petition against Chiluba's nationality and re-election being withdrawn from the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition was brought shortly after Zambia's elections last November by a coalition of opposition parties, including Kaunda's United National Independence Party (Unip).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda, who also has a petition coming up against him in the court in a few weeks, could have the case withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remmy Mushota, former legal minister in Chiluba's government, and Patrick Katyoka, a prominent member of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), have petitioned the supreme court contending that Kaunda is a Malawian citizen because his parents originally came from Malawi, and that he has never renounced his Malawian citizenship properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a constitutional amendment instituted by Chiluba, no one with parents who are not Zambian is allowed to become president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revelations of the clandestine political- cum-legal trade-off first came to light this week in the government-owned Sunday Mail newspaper.  Representatives of Chiluba and Kaunda have reportedly been meeting in secret locations to hammer out the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when confronted with the revelations, both camps denied such talks taking place. Kaunda's press secretary Muhabi Lungu said he was not aware of such talks. Lungu said Kaunda would not agree to such a trade-off because, in his view, the two cases would have different outcomes. He said Kaunda is not afraid of the petition against him because he is &quot;a Zambian through and through&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, Lungu pointed out that the trade- off would be untenable because the petition against Chiluba involves other parties apart from Unip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba's press relations assistant, Richard Sakala, said: &quot;State House has never made any manoeuvres to try to have a settlement with anybody on the matter. This matter is in court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakala said the petition against Kaunda was instituted by private individuals, and Chiluba's government had nothing to do with it. But some political analysts have said it is noteworthy that both Mushota and Katyoka, until late last year, were among Chiluba's close lieutenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days before the revelations of the trade-off came to light, close aides of Chiluba's reportedly visited Kaunda's house on an undisclosed mission. When one of them was asked, he said: &quot;Ask the people who were visited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l Jailed special projects editor of The Post newspaper, Masautso Phiri, has appealed to the Zambian Supreme Court to have his three months' imprisonment reviewed, arguing, among other things, that his incarceration is unlawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phiri, who has chosen to represent himself rather than hire a professional lawyer, has filed a 27-point affidavit in the supreme court. He contends that his case merits review because the criminal procedure code was not followed in sentencing him to prison, and that he has differences with three of the seven supreme court judges who sat in judgment over his case two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - She sits across the table, carving enthusiastically into a large steak. &quot;Garlic, love it, but it's bad for business.'' Tonight Sandy van der Toorn is off duty. There will be no fondling in the jacuzzi, no whipping clients hanging like carcasses from pulleys in the ceiling, no naked massages and definitely no sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eager customers who dial her cellphone in desperate need of such services are told to call back tomorrow, or are referred to another member of her East London escort business. Tonight this vivacious redhead is eating garlic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listening to her talk about her work, I decide that here is a supreme vindication of Oscar Wilde's epigram: &quot;Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it, and the bloom is gone.&quot; The bloom has not gone from this mother of three, who faces criminal charges for breaching the Immorality Act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her job as an &quot;escort&quot; and masseuse may include sex and sadomasochism role- playing, but Van der Toorn vehemently denies being a prostitute. Rather, she has cast herself in the role of a modern-day courtesan, entertaining the lonely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is therefore suing Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi for R30 000, claiming police breach-ed her civil rights when they invaded her private property without a search warrant and caught her in flagrante delicto with an undercover officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a successful trap. A new client responding to a local newspaper advertisement called on her cellphone and arrang-ed an afternoon session. She picked him up, drove to the escort agency premises (a neat three-bedroomed house near the beachfront), where he was offered booze and a baby powder massage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her shy client was a policeman, and he was wired for sound; their every word was recorded as evidence for a magistrate to sit in judgment over.  Perhaps she should have been suspicious when he &quot;could not get it up'' and went into the living room to retrieve a special &quot;Indian ointment&quot; from his jacket, which he claimed would aid his problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As she followed him buck naked to help in the search, South African Narcotics and Alcohol Bureau (Sanab) officers burst into the house. &quot;They were in the living room, and I just turned tail and ran back into the bedroom, with my fat bottom jiggling in full view. I was so embarrassed.'' One might have thought a seasoned pro would be unfazed by such occupational hazards, but no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most humiliating part was that they kept me standing in the bedroom clutching a shirt in front of me, which covered very little, while they searched the room, laughing at the sex toys and stuff they found.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She may have been in the world's oldest profession for nearly three years - and by all accounts she is so proficient at her job that clients will fly her all over the country - but Van der Toorn oozes a certain childish charm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least coming to me these men won't go and have an affair which could break up their marriage,'' she argues, adding without a hint of humour: &quot;In any case, there is nothing for businessmen to do in this town when they visit.  &quot; If local councillors are not careful, she will be sending them a bill for providing an essential community service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A prostitute is someone who takes your money and does the job, but I sometimes only give my company. It's up to the client if things go further. I provide a service and people pay for my time, like they would for a psychiatrist. In any case, how two consenting adults enjoy themselves should be no one else's business.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her vitality is deafening, as she recounts some of the dramas in her life since divorcing her policeman husband and moving from Cape Town with her three young children. Bright, barefaced, scandalously bold, yet with a hint of naivety and vulnerability, she reminds me of a childhood friend in England who would allow spotty 12-year-old boys to &quot;feel her up&quot; at school discos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it is, Van der Toorn's fleshy face is caked in make-up, like a child playing with her mother's cosmetics - adding unfalteringly to her 26 years.  But there is a playfulness about her which is incongruous with the image I had of this dominant S&amp;M mistress flaying men while their head and wrists are locked into a stockade I spotted in her working bedroom (a moody cavernous space, all black sheets and black curtains).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are many faces to this feisty flame-haired &quot;courtesan&quot;: when not escorting or massaging, she is mothering her children. She is also a business woman, making good money the only way she knows how, in order to keep her family in a comfortable lifestyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an honest living. There is no pimp, no drugs, no exploitation - just women trying to survive, using God-given tools. Would it be better if she were on the street?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Toorn has already been there, and her answer is a definitive no.  Harsh life experiences have put her on the road she now travels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her parents divorced when she was three and the Holmes (as she was then) grew up modestly in the Tableview area of Cape Town with her mother, sister and brother, who is a policeman. She says her father is the wealthy owner of a fleet of fishing boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musically, rather than academically inclined, she dropped out of secretarial college to marry her policeman boyfriend after falling pregnant at the age of 17. He was a deacon in the Dutch Reformed Church. Van der Toorn describes him as manipulative and abusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He used to lose his temper and knock me around. I left him about five times but always went back, thinking he would change. But when I caught him shaking my baby violently one day, it was the end.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the divorce, she spent time with her sister, mother and the children selling apples from a bakkie, but they had a series of misfortunes (their first vehicle was burnt out when they gave a lift to a couple who made a braai in the back, and the second ended in a river). She also tried her hand at waitressing, but found age was against her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were desperate. I'm doing this because there was no other way to earn enough money to feed my family. I did not mind hard physical work, but there was none available for a white woman down on her luck. I think we were the only white hawkers in Grahamstown between 1992 and 1993. We thought that by working hard and following the rules, things would come up right. But we had to grow up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So she went to work for an escort agency in Cape Town, eventually moving to an agency in East London, where she soon married a 52-year-old local farmer who was a client, only to find out later that he already had a wife. &quot;I thought he was a meal ticket and he spoilt me rotten, but I have principles and morals. I won't stay with someone who's already married.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only after her sister pointed out that the local escort agencies were ripping off their employees with fines, alcohol tabs and low pay that Van der Toorn decided to set herself up as an independent in 1995. &quot;Within a week I was able to buy a car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her current problems stemmed from her attempt to set up a rival business with her sister, Linda. At one stage in 1995 they had about 10 employees - now they have seven. Some of the other escort agencies (there are five in this tiny town) complained to their police contacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Toorn describes many police as &quot;booker-outers who don't pay for a good time at the other agencies. But I say business is business.'' Though some police clients are prepared to fork out money, others see it as a perk of the job. Her no- free-sex policy has not gone down well: &quot;That's the main reason why I'm the only agency being targeted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say they were only reacting to her bold newspaper advert: &quot;Red-hot red-head. Not for the faint-hearted. Call Sandy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A podgy woman, with slightly bucked teeth and dripping with gold chains, a diamond bracelet and several rings on her large fingers, Van der Toorn charges about R300 an hour or R1 500 for an &quot;all-nighter&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My clients are mostly regulars. They are very needy people who want a secret friend with whom to share special moments.&quot; They call about promotions, babies being born - even when they have a problem. She's so successful it was a long time before she was able to find a local doctor or attorney who was not a client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most are aged between 25 and 60, though she did once have a 70-year-old. &quot; He obviously wanted to try it before he died, and I was surprised he was able to get it up,'' she giggles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her face is animated with satisfaction as she talks about her current lack of financial worries - she owns two premises and is saving for her children's education. &quot;My private house is in a nice suburb with five bedrooms, a big garden for the kids and a pool. I'm not proud of what I do, but of my achievements. But it's difficult to see a way out now I'm used to the money.  How can I now go and earn less?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Presidential Review Commission, created a year ago to help in the reform of the public service, was set up for failure and should be abolished, one of its own members says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Fanie Cloete, of the School of Public Management at the University of Stellenbosch, has accused the government of manipulating the commission, which is supposed to be independent. The commission was created to recommend ways to shake up the country's public service, long regarded as bloated and inefficient. It was to present its report in August, but has been derailed by internal problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a hard-hitting letter to the Mail &amp; Guardian, Cloete writes that &quot;the only way in which the commisssion could succeed with its important mandate to advise the government about the medium-term to long- term strategic direction of the public service is if it gets full and public political and administrative support from the government without attempts to manipulate its activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;International experience has proved that real public-service reform can only happen if it is driven independently from outside but with input from within the bureaucracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloete also accuses Dr Paseko Ncholo, Director-General of Public Works and Administration, of trying to redirect a portion of the R14,5-million committed to the commission by the British, Canadian and Swedish governments to his department to pursue his own reform initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloete says he will resign from the commission if steps are not taken to secure its financial and administrative independence. His threat comes in the wake of the resignation of the commission chair, Professor Bax Nomvete, although the departure of Nomvete has not yet been officially acknowledged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloete suggests the job of reforming the public service be taken over by the newly created Public Service Commission, which is to be set up before the middle of the year in accordance with the new Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also confirms there was an attempt by the government late last year to close the commission, which was reported by the M&amp;G last year but was recently dismissed as unfounded rumour by the Minister of Public Works and Administration, Zola Skweyiya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncholo declined to comment on Cloete's accusations and reconfirmed the government's support for the commission this week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Bushmen of 31 Battalion fought on the losing side and now they are paying the ultimate price, writes Adam Alexander</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN the Karoo desert, the sun is setting over an army camp unlike any other in the world. This is the time when the sea of mudbrown tents called Schmidtsdrif springs to life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The encampment has been home to a desperately damaged community for seven years. Here, under the auspices of the army, 4 000 people live and die on the banks of the Vaal river, 72km from Kimberley.  Neglected, in some cases to the point of starvation, they are the remnants of South Africa's 31 Battalion --- the force of fighting Bushmen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many have died of hunger here,&quot; said Riano Nduve, a 23-year-old Bushman who teaches Afrikaans at the camp. &quot;Sometimes the doctors at the sick bay tell them they have something else and that it is not hunger. But it's not the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nduve, who works as part of a new government education programme to aid the Bushmen, claims that as many as 100 people have died of starvation since the camp was formed and that many are now afraid to visit the sick bay at the camp in case they, too, &quot;disappear&quot;. &quot;My mother went with only a headache. I never saw her alive again,&quot; said one Bushman. Most of the Bushmen here do not trust the army anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a wonder they trust anyone. Yet few communities need a sick bay as much as this one. Twenty-five years of almost continuous war have shattered these naturally non- aggressive people, used as frontline troops first by the Portuguese colonists in Angola, then by the South African defence forces against Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are the most traumatised community in the world,&quot; said human-rights lawyer Roger Chennels, a member of a trust board set up to help the Bushmen. &quot; They are the only group of Bushmen in Africa who will kill each other with a bow and arrow over an argument.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were brought to this corner of the military training ground of Schmidtsdrif in 1990 after Namibia's independence and they have been in limbo ever since, living on the meagre salaries of the few soldiers still employed by the army and on endless broken promises. &quot;Nothing could be worse for Bushmen than to put them in straight lines and tell them to live in one place.  They're used to roaming southern Africa and being free,&quot; said Chennels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army is now busy integrating more than seven armies into one new force and has more to think about than the Bushmen who served the country so loyally and bravely. Fewer than 100 have been integrated into the 3 Infantry Battalion based at Kimberley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former infantryman Smit Tjiohimba (34) looks much older than his years. He has been trying for three years, since his demobilisation, to get an army pension to support his wife and two children. His letters to military headquarters in Pretoria have met with no reply. &quot;They promised us we would get pensions but we never got them,&quot; said Tjiohimba, who keeps his family alive by fishing in the Vaal and selling his catch in the nearest town 40km away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His eyes are bloodshot from cheap wine as he watches a traditional dance next to his tent, and his face betrays the profound disappointment that pervades the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet he is one of the lucky ones. Walk into the sick bay and you pass uniformed Bushmen who lost limbs as frontline trackers for the army. There are 50 amputees at the camp. They will tell you about the mine or grenade that maimed them but they will not talk about the war or how they feel now. &quot; They are very secretive,&quot; said Captain Steve Moyo, a nurse at the sick bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moyo believes the Bushmen are deteriorating rapidly --- mentally and physically. &quot;They have no income and they don't know where they stand. They live for today. Tomorrow they don't know where they will be. They got a lot of promises that they would be resettled in a month or two --- and this is now their sixth year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest promise is of a farm outside Kimberley, bought for them by the government two months ago. They are forbidden to grow food on any reasonable scale at Schmidtsdrif, so this would at last give them an area where they could feed themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Bushmen are wary of promises. Sergeant Major Engelbrecht, second-in- command at Schmidtsdrif, said: &quot;The whites migrated up from the south and the black tribes from central Africa migrated down - -- and the Bushmen were caught in the middle. They fought on the Portuguese side in the Angolan civil war and they fought on our side in the Namibian civil war --- and they've been fighting on the wrong side ever since.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swapo's victory in what is now Namibia threatened the Bushmen with possible retribution. Engelbrecht explained: &quot;They were given a choice --- to stay or to come back with us --- and 500 of them, with their families, decided to come with us. The idea was to spend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R52,5-million building a town for them here at Schmidtsdrif, and that 31 Battalion would carry on as an ethnic type of battalion like the British Gurkhas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's government had other ideas. It disbanded the battalion in 1994.  Having taken up South African citizenship, none of its members could return to their homes in Namibia or Angola. Yet the army claims to have only a &quot; municipal&quot; responsibility to them now --- providing water, sanitation, refuse collection and the sick bay, but not food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers who led them in the war against Swapo praised them at the time as skilled trackers and brave soldiers. They certainly needed to be brave: the 500 now at Schmidtsdrif left another 500 dead in battle. &quot;They took very heavy casualties,&quot; said Engelbrecht. &quot;But they are people who can easily adapt. Nowadays we use the Bushmen in 3 Battalion with the same success in the townships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those left at Schmidtsdrif, hopes of a return to the old way of life lie with the children. Their faces do not bear the scars of war. They burst with happiness. The smallest ones carry bows and arrows fashioned from twigs and nylon cord, and deftly search for what little bush fauna exists here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the sun has set on Schmidtsdrif, the elders tell stories of how they lived before the world found them and carved up the land they roamed freely.  Many have turned to Christianity for support. A bizarre double dose of Western culture is provided in the shape of a church that doubles every Friday night as a cinema. Sermons are currently vying with the Mutant Ninja Turtles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a government education programme involving 26 teachers, priming the Bushmen with new skills in preparation for the long-awaited move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When that move comes, Schmidtsdrif will eventually be handed over to a group of Tswana people who won it in a recent land claim. The Bushmen will be glad to see the back of it but they won't believe it until it happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wisely, it seems. &quot;We cannot say that 1998 is written in gold as the year they will be resettled. If we can manage it by the year 2000 then it's thumbs up,&quot; said Engelbrecht.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Department of Home Affairs is swamped with so many applicants for political asylum it is contemplating setting up reception centres around the country to accommodate them while they wait for their cases to be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 800 people apply for political asylum in South Africa every month - a number that has been increasing exponentially since South Africa started accepting refugees under United Nations guidelines in 1993. In a good month, the Department of Home Affairs processes only 20 to 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers reflect primarily an increase in asylum seekers from elsewhere in Africa - Nigerians fleeing the repression in their country, and Somalians escaping the chaos of theirs. There are growing numbers from the conflict- ridden Great Lakes region. But large numbers also have come here from India - second only to Nigeria in the number of applications pending; from Pakistan, Senegal and Bulgaria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of more than 23000 applications in the department files on January 31, nearly half had not yet been processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department acknowledged its problems in coping with the influx of refugees at a conference in Mpumalanga with members of the Green Paper Task Group on Migration and Immigration, and specialists in the field of refugee work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task group has spent this week working on a rough draft of a new refugee policy, with the goal of clarifying who should and who should not be granted asylum, and of redesigning the system to accommodate them. It will replace a Bill the department drafted and then put on hold to allow the task group to start from scratch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Home Affairs has done as well as can be expected with its limited resources to set up a progressive system that complies with international refugee law, refugee specialists say, its programme is not working. Relief workers are concerned about further strain on the system with refugees expected from the Great Lakes conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every relief worker has a horror story. A tireless worker with refugees, Sister Joan Pearson of the Sisters of Mercy, told how the Catholic church had taken on a group of some 130 refugees from all over Africa who, after four years of waiting for Home Affairs to process their applications, became angry.  They staged a protest last July outside the Union Buildings and were forced to retreat to the Catholic church, which set them up in a camp in Garankuwa where they still live - the majority in tents - waiting for their applications to be processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are all professionals - engineers, administrators, teachers. And they are particularly worried about their children who, until they are formally granted refugee status, do not have access to schools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to provide them with everything because they are not allowed to work, and they feel very unwanted. People have dropped pamphlets off at their homes telling them to go away because they are foreigners,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pearson and task group members such as Zanele Mbeki argue that the government, in conjunction with non-governmental organisations, should set up resettlement centres to provide newcomers - such as the 130 who fled from African states -with a base from which to work out their next steps.  Currently refugees have to find their own accommodation, usually in the slums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic church is already negotiating with the Gauteng provincial government to use the old Johannesburg Hospital as a reception centre where refugees can seek sanctuary in their first few days in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But setting up separate refugee settlements could create more problems than it solves - particularly given that the government is unable to provide food, shelter and education for its poorest citizens. Refugee specialists are also concerned that it could inflame the xenophobia already felt by many South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International refugee expert professor James Hathaway, from the Osgoode Hall Law School of York University, urged the task group to balance human rights principles against the practical realities of South Africa in the formulation of laws and policy. He said South Africa ought to promote burden- sharing - where states in a region share the responsibility of accommodating refugees, and this would mean extensive negotiations with Southern African Development Community countries to work out a common approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also warned the task group that it would be drawing up policy at a time when many countries were sealing their borders and hardening their hearts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's reputation as &quot;a paradise in Africa&quot; means it is a favoured destination for Africa's more than seven million refugees - about one-third of the total world refugee population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, Bruno Geddo, described the average refugee in South Africa as a young man, between 20 and 30 years of age with between seven and 12 years of schooling and an urban background. Only 5,4% of recognised refugees are female and 5,6% children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geddo said refugees in South Africa survived by hawking, piece work and hand- outs from relief organisations. Most, he said, were interested in setting up their own businesses, and younger people were wanting education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, refugees have freedom to move where they want within the country, a privilege not usually extended to refugees elsewhere, making South Africa an even more attractive destination. Many, once they arrive in South Africa, travel further south, to lodge their applications in Cape Town, saying that the queues are shorter, the people friendlier and the officials less corrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, all speakers identified as a major problem the xenophobia of South Africans who feel that outsiders - whether refugees or illegal immigrants - are threatening their livelihood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the task group, Idasa's executive director Wilmot James, told the conference that legislation governing refugees would probably be tabled in Parliament early in 1988, a year before the elections. It is feared that South Africans' antagonism towards immigrants and refugees will be exploited to get votes. &quot;It's quite important for this issue of refugees to be depoliticised and this will require political leadership and a great deal of public education,&quot; said James this week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A wedge has been driven through Western Cape cricket over the decision to drop an investigation into Western Province Cricket Association vice-president Percy Sonn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonn, who is also Western Cape deputy attorney general, told the Mail &amp; Guardian last month that he often drank heavily, had told SABC commentator Martin Locke to &quot;fuck off back to Rhodesia&quot; and that &quot;the white English people on the Western Province Cricket Association executive live in England and should return there because they can't handle a coloured person as president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonn apologised to Locke and denied the other comments attributed to him, and United Cricket Board managing director Ali Bacher this week dismissed the allegations as &quot;a storm in a tea cup&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Western Province Cricket Club - the province's biggest cricket club, and owner of the Newlands cricket ground - wants the issue pursued, claiming the cricket board's stance is unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our only interest is cricket and I believe Sonn's statements indicate that he can't act in its best interest,&quot; club chairman Brian Biebuyck says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The issue has nothing to do with prejudice on our part. In fact, it is Sonn's alleged statements that contain racist remarks. We believe that the cricket board did not deal with the incident at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonn - who is angling to be next president of the cricket association - declined to comment this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he previously told the M&amp;G he enjoyed a drink &quot;since drinking is so much part of the culture of my people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biebuyck said written complaints had been handed to the cricket association about Sonn's behaviour at a post-match function following the third day of a recent match between South Africa and India. But these had disappeared prior to the executive discussing the issue with Sonn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bacher declined to comment on Sonn's behaviour at post-match functions, but said he was a valued board member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that Biebuyck &quot;is not the right person to initiate an investigation into Sonn. The Western Province Cricket Club is a club with many sport codes and as such cannot act in the interests of cricket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cricket association insiders told the M&amp;G this week that the row could scupper Sonn's chances of securing the association's presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seemed a certainty prior to the media coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive member Norman Arendse is now being touted as a potential challenger. He also refused to comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The paper trail stemming from secret six- figure payouts to senior staff at Stellenbosch University led to the rector's office this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Andreas van Wyk, who until now has kept silent on the payouts, is being challenged on his campus to confirm or deny whether he handed himself a windfall of R160000. To date, he has declined to take up the offer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Academics and staff claim Van Wyk received the payment last June, the same month he bought a R400 000 holiday home in Hermanus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Wyk's failure to respond to the charge has done little to assuage anger on the campus, particularly as the administration has warned that lower subsidies will force a 10% cut in the university's staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian revealed in December that five senior administrative staff members, including the two vice-rectors Professors Christo Viljoen and Walter Claassen, received secret payouts of between R127 000 and R200000 last year. Van Wyk personally authorised the cheques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The university's council has defended the payouts on the grounds that they were paid to administrative staff in lieu of sabbatical leave that they were unable to take, such were their duties at the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council also said the payments had been endorsed by its remuneration committee and declared them legitimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the payouts saddled Stellenbosch with the prospect of a hefty fine from the Receiver of Revenue, after the administration allegedly failed to deduct tax, and enraged students and academics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Wyk failed to contain staff dissatisfaction over the payments last month at an emergency meeting. The council has been forced to place the matter on its agenda for a second time for discussion this Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lobbying ahead of the meeting has already started, with one faction pressing for an independent inquiry into the payments and the other arguing that sinister forces on the campus are attempting to frame Van Wyk in a bid to destroy the institution. Academics have been giving the M&amp;G quotes and then withdrawing them, while savaging each other's reputations in personal correspondence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stellenbosch had still to respond to queries from the M&amp;G at the time of going to press. The questions were put to the university last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Academics and students also feel that the secrecy of the university's executive is blocking the much-needed transformation process on the campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G understands that a new report to be handed to Van Wyk on its transformation will paint a disturbing picture of where the university has gone wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, by John Swanepoel who took over the university's academic development programme earlier this year, is expected to argue that Stellenbosch has succeeded only in maintaining the separation of former disadvantaged communities from the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme was instituted to provide bridging education for students who could not make initial entrance qualifications at the university, mainly black students who were not proficient in Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, little more than 1% of the 15 000- strong Stellenbosch student body is black. Many black students told the M&amp;G this week that they felt they were being deliberately marginalised, particularly by the university's policy of mainly teaching in Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Education gets more money but too late to prevent stringent cost-cutting and student unrest, report Tangeni Amupadhi and Carien du Plessis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Ministry of Education may have succeeded in securing more money for tertiary education, but it has come too late to prevent stringent cost- cutting on campuses across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several universities and technikons contacted by the Mail &amp; Guardian this week said that even with the additional government funding, they received far less this year than they had received last year. For many institutions, the new allocation will go straight into operating expenses - paying for staff salaries and building operations. Others said they would use the money to reduce deficits.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu's announcement of the increase also failed to quell campus unrest, which has disrupted most of South Africa's so- called black tertiary institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been estimated that one student in six has been affected by campus turmoil. Among the hardest hit has been the University of Transkei. The universities of the North, Fort Hare and North West, and the Eastern Cape Technikon, have been closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fort Hare is the latest university to close, due to students protesting against the exclusion of those who fail to pay fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, in his Budget address on Wednesday, confirmed that tertiary institutions would receive an allocation of R5,4- billion for the 1997/98 fiscal year, representing an average funding level of 65,6% (a percentage of the total subsidy due under a funding formula dating back years).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure was 68% last year, but Bengu had warned in December that the initial funding level for 1997/98 was likely to be just 60%, prompting institutions to start planning drastic budget cuts, and students and academics to start planning campus protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with the increase, most of the budget cuts remain in place - the University of the Witwatersrand, Cape Town, Rhodes, Stellenbosch, Natal and Peninsula Technikon said their subsidy levels would still only be 63%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wits said even with the new allocation, it faced a shortfall of R17-million.  There is no reason &quot;to think that further cuts will not be imposed in future national budgets,&quot; said Wits representative Peggy Jennings. &quot;We must assume that the latest partial reprieve is likely to be temporary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Cape Town representative Helen Zille said the new subsidy levels were &quot;our worst-case scenario and will impose a very stringent financial regime on the university&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University of the Western Cape is to receive R9-million more than expected (it had been braced for a R27-million cut), while Stellenbosch is getting R2-million more (after expecting a R24,8-million cut). The extra funds for the University of the Western Cape still amount to a shortfall of R14-million, which will mean that salary increases will be below the level of inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pentech said that any subsidy level of less than 68% would still hurt, while the University of Pretoria warned that its capacity for a larger intake of students has been limited. The University of Durban- Westville said it was now searching for a longer-term solution to continued funding difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bengu attempted to direct much of the increased allocation toward the so- called black institutions. But South African Students' Congress Organisation (Sasco) national president Andile Sihlahla said the money still fell short of the funds necessary to benefit the formerly disadvantaged communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons for campus unrest at the moment range from rows about fees - involving Sasco, the Pan African Students' Organisation and various worker organisations - to straightforward attempted management coups, launched by disaffected academics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University of the North, which called in the police two weeks ago when student demonstrations turned violent, said this week the campus would reopen on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the university, owed R54-million by its students, set preconditions for the reopening, including that there be &quot;no taking of hostages during demonstrations&quot; and &quot;no barricading of exits and entrances to and from campuses&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Gauteng health department could save R1-billion if it accepts cost-cutting proposals made by health workers' unions, including centralising services, eliminating private nursing in public hospitals, and scrapping private security, the unions said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure is almost double the R550- million the Gauteng health department said it could save when it presented its hospital transformation plan to the provincial cabinet last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that if we scrap private services then this cost-saving figure is not impossible,&quot; said Edward Khanyile, chairman of the Johannesburg branch of the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu), a member of the union research team that examined the department's proposal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union counter-proposal on hospital transformation was due to be presented to the health department on Friday. Department spokesman Popo Maja said it was too early to say whether the union's proposed cost savings are realistic. &quot;We haven't finalised the plan and we don't know when it will be implemented,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khanyile said the department had overlooked a number of cost-saving measures, such as the centralisation of hospital casualty departments. The union says that instead of being spread out among several hospitals, casualty services could be relocated to one central hospital, &quot;creating a central pool of casualty officers,&quot; and alleviating confusion about where people needing emergency services should go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khanyile also believed retrenchments could be avoided if the department stopped its practice of contracting private nurses to work in its hospitals.  The Health Department's deputy director general Eric Buch said the department was doing its utmost to avoid retrenchment: &quot;We hope that by offering severance packages we could alleviate the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buch said more than 3000 severance packages have been already approved and nearly 500 applications are under consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khanyile said the union hoped that transformation could begin by June. The health department initially said it would begin closing hospitals by the end of March - the three hospitals to be closed are Andrew McColm, Kempton Park and the Westfort psychiatric hospital. Seven hospitals are to be converted to primary health care centres starting July 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are now looking toward the third quarter of the year for implementation, &quot; said Buch. He added that they were looking at the possibility of a more phased approach but would need to maintain contact with the unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buch was concerned about the effect on morale of further delaying change. &quot; People are worried because they're unsure of what will happen in the future,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unions and the department agree that Hillbrow Hospital should be downgraded to a district hospital with a community health centre and a maternity unit. But plans to transform Hillbrow Hospital are being put on hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that could be delayed as the department considers the findings of a Wits task team headed by Max Price, dean of the faculty of health sciences at the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price's team has recommended that Hillbrow's capacity be reduced from its present size of 700 beds to 400 beds, 100 of which would be used for patients with chronic illnesses such as Aids or tuberculosis. &quot;Our proposal reduces the need for retrenchment and redeployment and keeps specialists in the public sector,&quot; said Price.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'Peace' initiators are said to be holding peace to ransom, reports Ann Eveleth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE decision by the KwaZulu-Natal government to sit on a damning report linking key politicians in the province to hit-squad activity has raised fresh concerns about the region's embryonic peace drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A South African National Defence Force (SANDF) report leaked last week on hit- squad allegations named African National Congress MP Sifiso Nkabinde and his KwaZulu-Natal Midlands Inkatha Freedom Party counterpart David Ntombela - both warlords and self-proclaimed exponents of the peace initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the delay in releasing the report - the province's parliamentary sub- committee hashad a copy since November - suggest the warlords may be holding the peace process to ransom, violence monitors and some African National Congress members claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The report has been around for four months and similar allegations have been around for years,&quot; said one ANC MP from the province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But political leaders are being held to ransom by the prospect that these warlords who have ingratiated themselves into the peace process could renew their paramilitary activity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkabinde and Ntombela declared themselves &quot;peacelords&quot; last year after peace talks, led by ANC chairman Jacob Zuma and IFP public works MEC Celani Mtetwa, got under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two warlords have addressed joint rallies in disputed strongholds and have become central in efforts to win the support of their constituencies for the peace effort. The peace talks include a &quot;special amnesty&quot; provision which may allow for secret disclosures of crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC MPP Dumisane Makhaye this week slammed IFP MPP Arthur Konigkramer's &quot; selective&quot; leak of the report last week, saying the disclosure had &quot;destroyed&quot; the prospects for legal action against those implicated by the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But observers suggest there may be more to the growing culture of secrecy in the province. Network of Independent Monitors director Jenni Irish said related investigations had been under way for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the SANDF should have been handed its report directly to the National Investigation Task Unit responsible for the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands probes, rather than handing it to politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the concern is for the safety of the investigation, it should not have been given to political parties, but if the purpose of the report was to deal with the problem of 'no-go' areas, then that should be a transparent process,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provincial parliamentary sub-committee given the report was appointed last year to investigate claims that Nkabinde and his supporters had turned his Richmond stronghold into a &quot;no-go&quot; area for the security forces and political opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report - compiled by the army's controversial Group Nine and signed by its equally controversial then leader Colonel Jan Hougaard - said Richmond was not a &quot;no- go&quot; area but an &quot;activated&quot; area which could become a potential flashpoint or high-risk area &quot;in a matter of seconds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report did, however, link Nkabinde and his supporters to plans to murder IFP leaders, gun-running from the former Transkei homeland and the formation of a &quot;private army&quot; in the Midlands. The report also levelled allegations against IFP MPP Phillip Powell and Traditional Affairs MEC Chief Nyanga Ngubane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkabinde has denied the allegations and challenged the officials behind them to lay charges against him. Fellow ANC MPP John Jeffreys echoed this concern at Wednesday's parliamentary safety and security portfolio committee where he described the allegations as &quot;hearsay&quot; and Natal Violence monitor Mary de Haas said probes by the now-disbanded Investigation Task Unit and its successor, the National Investigation Task Unit, had run into trouble after the death of witnesses. &quot;It's one thing to have allegations, but another to prove them, especially when key witnesses are dying,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian understands that there are &quot;huge&quot; concerns within the ANC about Nkabinde and the damage the allegations could cause to the peace talks. But the party has still to determine how to rein him in. Efforts by the ANC's national leadership to bar Nkabinde from election to the party's provincial executive committee last November failed when he defied the order and rallied his supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nkabinde controls a large support base in the Midlands, and this could be dangerous if he is outside the party, and without him we would face a leadership vacuum in the area which could lead to greater conflict with the IFP,&quot; said one senior party member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the party believed the problem could be dealt with more effectively by the national leadership, but this had been complicated by the IFP's call for a provincial commission to probe the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irish said the question was further complicated by intertwined interests of warlords on both sides: &quot;You can't look at one warlord, without looking at the others, so a probe into Nkabinde will open up questions about Ntombela, Powell and others named in the report,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is understandable that certain aspects of negotiations will be held in secret, but the danger of the entire peace process happening in private is warlords can then exploit the process to entrench their division of the province into respective strongholds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parliamentary portfolio committee postponed its decision on the matter to allow its members to study the report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Ali Phosa is being investigated in connection with the disappearance of about R500 000 of RDP funds. Ann Eveleth reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STATE-OWNED port operator Portnet is investigating alleged mismanagement of Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) funds by the brother of Mpumalanga Premier Matthew Phosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parastatal said this week it wanted Ali Phosa to provide receipts for his expenditure during his two-year stint as co-ordinator of RDP projects at Durban Port, the busiest in Africa. Around R500 000 is under investigation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phosa denied the allegations on Wed-nesday, telling the Mail &amp; Guardian it had &quot;no business&quot; inquiring into Portnet affairs. Port manager Bax Nomvete, who called an emergency meeting on Wednesday to ensure all queries were channelled to him, was unavailable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Portnet human resources executive Patrick Dada confirmed that the investigation was under way, following allegations by port union representatives in a recent joint forum with managers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation is understood to centre on claims that Phosa paid cash to RDP projects that could not be traced, to individuals in contravention of Portnet regulations and for items which did not qualify as RDP items. These allegedly included a video camera, a marquee, tents and consulting fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dada would not comment on the veracity of the allegations until the investigation is complete: &quot;I cannot say whether they are true or false. They are being investigated. If there is any substance to the allegations, they will be exposed internally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trade unions have a right to know that our RDP projects are benefiting their communities and are not just a corporate public relations exercise. In this context, we have said the books must be opened, Phosa must explain how he has spent the money and show receipts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dada said the parastatal spent between R7- million and R10-million a year on RDP projects nationally. He referred further questions to Durban port human resources manager Arthur Mzimela, who referred the matter to Nomvete.  Mzimela said Phosa would have reported directly to Nomvete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phosa told the M&amp;G he had never heard of the organisation to which he is alleged to have paid consulting fees, and that the camera in question was in his office. He said he would be handing his response to Nomvete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dada said Phosa's RDP post - as well as all other RDP posts within the parastatal - had been dissolved in a process aimed at integrating the RDP into existing departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear what post Phosa currently holds as he refused further comment. But several employees said he had been promoted to the post of port security manager.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The foreign merchant banks handed the contract to help sell a R6-billion chunk of Telkom have secured government agreement that their fees, to be paid by the taxpayer, remain under wraps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Ministry this week refused to disclose how much money was paid to SBC Warburg, which was employed by the ministry, or Goldman Sachs, recruited by Telkom for the sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian understands that such banks usually command at least 1% of the value of the deal as their cut - meaning the two could have bagged R60- million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30% stake in Telkom is to be sold to a consortium of Malaysia Telekom and United States group SBC Communications. The deal, unveiled last week, essentially went through by default after leading European bidders France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom decided not to bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connie Molusi, spokesman for Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Jay Naidoo, said the banks had insisted on confidentiality clauses in their contracts. The tab, however, will be picked up by the taxpayer, through the ministry's budget, and indirectly through Telkom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Party finance representative Ken Andrew said there was no reason to keep the fees secret: &quot;It is astonishing that a government committed to transparency under a Constitution such as ours thinks every second matter is an exception to the rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the DP was frequently met with &quot;confidentiality clauses&quot; when asking for information such as the salaries of parastatal employees. &quot;Why did they (Telkom and the government) sign the confidentiality clauses in the first place?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final Constitution says: &quot;Everyone has the right of access to any information held by the state, and any information held by another person and that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights ... national legislation must be enacted to give effect to this right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warburg, which is also advising South African Airways, is top of the international equity privatisation league tables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank raised $6,8-billion for its client in privatisation-related deals between the beginning of 1995 and last September.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Critics of Cape Town's 2004 Olympic bid who say housing should come before sports would find fuel for their argument in the sports hall in nearby Paarl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past three months, the tiny hall has served as a temporary shelter for more than 400 homeless people, over half of them children. They live without running water or toilets. Disease is rife, particularly influenza and gastrointestinal illnesses. Children run around naked, while adults spend much of the day mopping up waste.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is without irony that the sports hall squatters explain how they got into this situation. Until late last year, they had lived in a squatter camp in Mbekweni, outside Paarl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The municipality of Paarl, located in the heart of the Cape's wine region, evicted them from the camp because it wanted the land. The reason it wanted the land was to build low-cost housing for homeless people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The squatters are facing eviction a second time, because the municipality wants the hall to be returned to its intended use, for indoor sports such as netball. The municipality is adamant it wants them off the premises by this Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The squatters have obtained legal help. With every resident chipping in R50, they hired lawyer Keith Sheldon. He has approached the national housing ministry, the provincial housing ministry and the municipal housing authorities, each time without result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national ministry said it did not know about the squatters; the provincial ministry said the case was not within its jurisdiction; the municipal authority said it did not care what happened to the squatters, as long as they were out by Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't vote for Nelson Mandela to find ourselves homeless,&quot; a representative of the squatters, Miseka Sifumba, told the Mail &amp; Guardian. &quot; Nobody cares about us, and I plead with Mandela to come and see for himself what our situation is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last year, the municipality couldn't get involved fast enough. It sent 500 police into the squatter camp, with predictably violent results: the shacks were burnt down, some by the police, some by the squatters themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The settlement had existed for three years, its residents were mostly local, but the municipality wanted the site for a new low- cost housing development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eviction order, municipal housing department head Ronald Brand said, specified that the authorities &quot;had no obligation to provide alternative housing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The municipality did allow them to use the sports hall, only about 200m down the road, and they crammed in to wait for &quot;some people in power&quot; to find them permanent shelter. When it became clear that the wait was going to be a long one, the sports hall squatters hired Sheldon to represent them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is certain is that the people cannot carry on living in these appalling conditions,&quot; Sheldon said. &quot;Something must be done to prevent serious illness.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - At least two of the investigators working on Sports Minister Steve Tshwete's probe into South African rugby can draw on extensive inside knowledge of the sport's administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation into the South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) faltered last week when it emerged that the 500-page dossier containing the central allegations against Sarfu mainly contained press clippings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Michael Katz, appointed to the investigating team to look into Sarfu's tax records, should bring some insight from his time as a director of Ellis Park Stadium - the company which controls the Transvaal Rugby Football Union's financial affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katz this week confirmed he was a director when the company was listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, but had resigned &quot;years ago&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports Department Director General Mthobi Tyamzashe, who is leading the task team, is a long-time friend of Mluleki George, Sarfu's senior vice- president. Tyamzashe called the Mail &amp; Guardian this week to determine whether allegations against George were being checked; George was sitting in the director general's office at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even corporate governance guru Mervyn King, another task team member, may have more than a passing interest in the sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listed media group Primedia, where the former judge was a non-executive director until six weeks ago, recently bought 50% of Megapro Marketing, the marketing firm which has enjoyed lucrative commission payments for sponsorships it arranged for Sarfu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task team, which also includes senior advocate Gilbert Marcus and ANC member Malindi Gcina, was expecting to hear this week whether Sarfu would co- operate with its efforts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Transkei Attorney General Christo Nel will prosecute casino magnate Sol Kerzner - provided Kerzner's pre-emptive attempt to stop him fails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nel, who has waged an often single-handed campaign to have the R2-million bribery and corruption charges against Kerzner tested in court, was restrained in an 11th-hour interim interdict this week from arresting Kerzner or applying for his extradition. Kerzner lives in London.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerzner's attorney, Sid Spilken, reportedly said Kerzner had sought the Umtata High Court interdict when he discovered that Nel was about to announce a decision about whether to charge Kerzner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerzner argued in the application that his constitutional right to a speedy hearing would be violated. The alleged crime - a R2-million payment to George Matanzima, then prime minister of the Transkei, for exclusive gambling rights - happened more than 10 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Selwyn Miller granted the interdict against Nel and his co- respondents - Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi and Justice Minister Dullah Omar - pending a hearing on Kerzner's application no later than May 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nel hit back immediately: a day later, he issued a warrant for the arrest of former Cape Town mayor and attorney David Bloomberg, Kerzner's alleged accomplice. Bloomberg, who was not party to Kerzner's application, is also resident in the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nel told the Mail &amp; Guardian: &quot;I want to proceed with (Kerzner's prosecution), provided it is constitutional.&quot; He said the interdict did not stop him from making some preparations for the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerzner's interdict is the latest in a long chain of events frustrating Nel's attempts to bring the Sun International founder to trial - and is an indication that Kerzner will not give up without a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerzner admitted to the Harms Commission of Inquiry in 1989 that he had been party to the payment to Matanzima, but claimed he had done it merely to secure gambling rights which already belonged to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nel tried to have Kerzner extradited from South Africa to the then &quot; independent&quot; Transkei, but was overruled in 1993 by the National Party government. Nel reopened the investigation in early 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year Kerzner was the subject of accusations over funding of political parties. After initial denials by the African National Congress, President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Kerzner had participated in a R2-million election donation to his party. The NP allegedly also received a sizeable donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nel said at the time that he would decide whether to prosecute as soon as his workload allowed. Clearly, Kerzner sensed that moment had arrived.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Tangeni Amupadhi reports on an inquiry into Northern Province property deals that have earned a fortune for an amiable Greek millionaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO the politicians and community leaders of the Northern Province he is a fatherly figure, a kind of patron saint of Phalaborwa. Dimitri Kourtoumbellides, known to his friends as Jimmy, has on various occasions settled feuds within the African National Congress, helped taxi operators get on their feet and built houses for his domestic workers. He has helped the poor pay for funerals, and sponsored bursaries for needy students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to evidence presented to the Semenya Commission of Inquiry last week, however, Kourtoumbellides has sold a building valued at R8-million to the provincial government for more than R18- million. Quantity surveyor Michael South testified that the government paid more for the building than it would for office space in Sandton.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kourtoumbellides and his partners have also received R40-million for the construction of a government complex, in which tender procedures were apparently flouted. Two cheques for R20-million each were paid out in October and November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission of inquiry was set up by Northern Province Premier Ngoako Ramathlodi to look into financial irregularities in acquisition of property.  So far the amiable Greek millionaire has occupied centre stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kourtoumbellides refused to speak to the Mail &amp; Guardian, and he allegedly told the local newspaper in Pietersburg, The Northern Review, that he would sue if it published his photograph. A spokesman for Kourtoumbellides, who would identify himself only as Rebo, said any article about him would be referred to his lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jo Mathebula, the mayor of Phalaborwa, Kourtoumbellides's home town, said the evidence presented to the commission has created the wrong impression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kourtoumbellides reportedly owns at least 50% of the buildings in Phalaborwa. He also owns property in Pietersburg and runs a service station and garage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people have benefited from Jimmy's kindness,&quot; said Mathebula. &quot;He is a really nice man. There could have been administrative problems (in the sale), but he is a clean man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathebula said he has known Kourtoumbellides for 20 years and described him as his &quot;best buddy&quot; . He called him a conciliator and a messiah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early 1990s, Kourtoumbellides reportedly posted bail for 20 ANC members arrested for political activities, said a local ANCleader. Before local government elections in 1995, Mathebula added, he was &quot;instrumental&quot; in uniting Phalaborwa with neighbouring communities in the former homelands of Gazankulu and Lebowa after they had refused to form one town council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, &quot;serious disputes&quot; over who should represent the ANC and its allies in the local election were only solved after Kourtoumbellides's intervention, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his prominent position in the community, Kourtoumbellides has refused any formal leadership positions, and he turned down an invitation to join the local council as an ANC representative. He is, Mathebula said, content to be a businessman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official in the provincial Department of Public Works said Kourtoumbellides is well liked by provincial leaders, but he declined to give names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He plays a facilitating role in various matters in the province, and he has been instrumental in bringing about change and tolerance among people in the movement ... I regard him as a comrade,&quot; Mathebula said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are those in the community who say the only people who do not like him are whites who disapproved of his links with blacks during the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the building disclosures are likely to cause some discomfort among his allies. They are also likely to add to the ANC's discontent with Ramathlodi.  The premier was recently defeated as the ANC's provincial chairman, by Senator George Mashamba, who ignored the instructions of the ANC's national executive committee not to contest the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramathlodi is viewed as a man who has run a clean administration. It is his government that is investigating the building of the government complex. Yet Ramathlodi appointed the Cabinet committee on accommodation that allegedly diverted R97- million from the salaries of provincial employees to pay for the first phase of the complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total cost of the complex has been estimated at more than R300-million, a sum that has yet to be included in the provincial budget. Construction by Kourtoumbellides and associates has been halted and tenders have been invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Malatji, director general of the province, addressed the local media this week about the building Kourtoumbellides sold to the province for more than twice its value. &quot;Public works made a naive assumption that it could go ahead and buy the building. Technically speaking, they should have gone back to the tender board. But I have to state that this was a mistake, and not a malicious action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Works finance director Maleho Nkomo said one reason why the province has been unable to keep track of its finances is that the finance department is &quot;unable to do basic arithmetic&quot;, and the computer system cannot track expenditure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The creation this week of black-owned Khulani Springbok Patrols consummates a long-standing relationship between the Inkatha Freedom Party and a 35-year-old family security business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security industry sources said this week the sale by the Bartmann family of a R50- million interest in Springbok Patrols to IFP-aligned Khulani Holdings - and the appointment of former IFP KwaZulu-Natal finance MEC Johnny Mhlungu as executive charman of the joint venture - was an effort by the company to retain its dominant position in the security industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources say Springbok was the target of a number of pointed remarks at a meeting this week between security companies and members of the KwaZulu- Natal Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial education minister Prince Vincent Zulu was also questioned about allegations that his wife worked for the new company. The sources say Zulu replied that &quot;people who are not employed by the government can work wherever they like&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Springbok founding owner Mick Bartmann said last week the purpose of the sale was to support &quot;the upliftment of the disenfranchised&quot;. But security sources say Springbok acted after losing a number of contacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zulu royal family sources said the company was also trying to get the family to endorse Khulani Springbok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Springbok has been dogged by controversy in recent years, stemming from submissions to the Goldstone commission and National Intelligence Agency (NIA) reports saying that the company was linked to train violence, that it trained Inkatha youth and that it employed members of IFP self- protection units (SPUs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report on security companies released by the Network of Independent Monitors (NIM) in 1996, said that Springbok's then KwaZulu-Natal general manager Gavin Ainsworth was an IFP leader who would &quot;employ only IFP members&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said IFP Youth Brigade leader Mbongeni Khumalo told the Goldstone commission in 1992 that he was hired by Ainsworth to establish a training base at Mandini, but the base never materialised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Springbok guard Zola Mathike subsequently told an inquest into train violence at Mlamankunzi Station on the Reef that he shot and killed two people during a November 1992 incident. Springbok later issued a report that Mathike had killed one person and injured another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And according to a 1993 City Press report, former Springbok shooting instructor Johannes Smit said in an affidavit that he trained IFP members in the use of lethal weapons at the company's training centre in Vereeniging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartmann, who is to remain as deputy chairman of Khulani Springbok, denied the allegation at the time, saying Smit invented the story after being fired.  Bartmann also told the press last week that Goldstone had cleared the company of the other charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1991, Bartmann and Springbok patrols were convicted in the Johannesburg regional court of unlawful possession of 707 firearms in the period 1986 to 1989, but in a 1995 appeal the charges were reduced to failure to report the loss of firearms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, according to a 1995 NIA report on violence in Durban and Johannesburg, cited in the NIM report, Springbok hired unemployed Inkatha SPU members. Inkatha trained at least 8 000 SPU members before the 1994 elections.  The NIA report also alleged that Springbok provided military training to disaffected SPU, IFP and Umkhonto weSizwe soldiers in Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Springbok has several lucrative contracts with South African parastatals, including Spoornet. Independent auditors looking into security contracts allege that Springbok has a practice called short-posting, in which the company is paid for workers who do not turn up for shifts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has had numerous contracts with the provincial government of IFP-ruled KwaZulu-Natal. The provincial finance department could not provide a list of contracts this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the contracts was a three-month non- tendered contract in mid-1996 to provide armed guards to 87 schools in KwaMashu and Umlazi after attacks on teachers and students. Springbok lost the lucrative contract - it had an estimated monthly value of R500 000 - when formal tenders were taken, but then got a smaller piece of the action when the provincial education ministry divided the contract between several firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has learned that Springbok lost its portion of the contract after local communities complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mhlungu resigned from the provincial government in 1996 to pursue &quot;business interests&quot; after it was revealed that he and several family members held shares in Khulani, which had an interest in gambling consortium African Sun International. Mhlungu's department controlled the province's gambling portfolio at the time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC dissident has invited two disaffected politicians to join him in discussions about a new political party, reports Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFRICAN National Congress dissident Bantu Holomisa is inviting both Rockey Malabane- Metsing and former Bophuthatswana president Lucas Mangope, to his consultative conference in June in anticipation of setting up a new political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa told the Mail &amp; Guardian that Malabane-Metsing sent a three-person delegation to his office in the centre of Johannesburg last week to discuss the new party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told them that at this moment we are unable to talk about alliances. The issue of whether alliances are an advantage or a disadvantage will be debated at the June conference. I invited them to come on board,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa said he knew Malabane-Metsing from his days at Shell House, and that he had asked the delegation to set up a face-to- face meeting with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malabane-Metsing is a man with an axe to grind. After leading the ANC in the North- West before the elections, he was defeated by Popo Molefe in the race for provincial premier, and subsequently dismissed from government in November 994 for allegedly not adhering to a policy of reconciliation. He performed poorly in the 1995 local government elections. Recently he has claimed, in an affidavit, that he may be the target of an assassination plot by unidentified ANC members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mangope, once Malabane-Metsing's arch enemy, kept a low profile after he was ousted as president of Bophuthatswana, but recently has returned to the public eye - largely because he is facing 208 charges of fraud for misappropriating millions of rands while he was in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is also to give evidence next week before the Tebbutt commission into the 1994 Bophuthatswana uprising. He is also suing Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal for calling him a baboon. Sources in the North- West say that his followers lately have been encouraging the singing of the old Bophuthatswana national anthem, a song regarded as unpatriotic by Molefe's administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Malabane-Metsing and Mangope have a small following among disgruntled public servants - a number of whom are increasingly disillusioned by the ANC government. Holomisa knows this constituency well, and speaks directly to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he said this week: &quot; The problem is a lack of governance in all provinces run by the ANC. It's a problem they have at a national level and it is expressed in their difficulty to implement policy. What is also coming up is that political nepotism is affecting productivity in the civil service, especially the appointment of unqualified people which is shaking the entire civil service to its fibre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Mmbatho so many civil servants who are trained, experienced and not corrupt are facing retrenchment, while ANC cadres get the jobs. People are complaining.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Holomisa is campaigning around the country, in advance of his June consultative conference. He is to address rallies at the University of the Western Cape this weekend, the Eastern Cape next weekend, and KwaZulu- Natal the week after that. In fact, he will be addressing rallies every Sunday until June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also started to speak the language of opposition parties -rhetoric usually heard from the National Party and the Democratic Party. In a briefing note for funders, Holomisa says: &quot;It is expected that South Africa should not repeat the same mistakes of African countries after they received independence ... Most of these governments were democratically elected, however, they hid under the cloak of democracy, yet practising dictatorship.  One of their tendencies has been to crush the opposition and the media thus leading to a one-party state.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The knife in his hand was a good 15cm long. But he was pleasant when he said, &quot;I don't want to hurt you. Just give me your money.&quot; His buddies surrounded me, four or five of them, pulled me back and to the ground and started grabbing at my pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They didn't beat me, so I found myself trying to brush their hands off, as if I were covered with spiders. Lots of people were milling around, so after a few seconds they stopped, and I was able to get up and run.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd seen the one with the knife just a few minutes before in Jeppe Street.  He and his friends tried to mug me there, too, hauling me to the ground and going for my pockets. I got away, but I made a mistake. I patted my breast pocket to see if my wallet was still there, which it was. And one of them saw me do that. &quot;Shit,&quot; I thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I jogged across Jeppe, made for Commissioner Street, where I'd seen dozens of cops in riot gear loafing around earlier that morning. But before I could get there the guy with the knife crossed the street in front of me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the second unsuccessful shakedown, I made it to Commissioner Street at a fast walk and headed for a bright-yellow armoured vehicle where cops were cradling their shotguns. There I took a moment for quiet reflection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I flew into Johannesburg six weeks ago from my home on the open plains of the American West. I moved into a heavily fortified commune in leafy Parkhurst with a couple of white guys who told me within an hour of my arrival not to go to the city centre unless I wanted the very South African experience of getting shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd smelled a whiff of paranoia in their advice, but on Wednesday morning, as I smoked a cigarette alongside the police, I was thinking South Africa may actually be a somewhat violent country. That's when I heard the chanting of 15 000 Zulus marching up the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was what I had been sent out to cover: Zulus marching to demand that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission find out the facts behind the 1994 &quot; Shell House Massacre&quot; in which 11 Zulu marchers were killed, most of them in a bloody battle said by the ANC to be an attempt to storm the ANC's headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That sounds fun,&quot; I thought. I put my tiny tourist camera in my pocket, grabbed a notebook and went looking for some action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marchers hadn't arrived at Library Gardens yet, so I went looking for them. That's when I got mugged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now the Zulus were coming. They came in waves, led by men in fur loincloths, dancing and hooting and chanting, painted shields at their sides, and thrusting their knobkerries and assegais into the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While choppers circled overhead, the marchers passed razor wire1,5 m high around City Hall. Library Gardens was filled; people perched in trees and on top of buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I stood near the library steps. Some of the men around me had thoughtfully sheathed the tips of their assegais with corn cobs. Self-styled &quot;soldiers&quot; in T-shirts that said &quot;Self-Protection Unit of KwaZulu&quot; separated the speakers from the crowd. Then came the long speeches from Zulu royalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is with a deep sense of sorrow and sadness ... that we remember those who were mercilessly mowed down with heavy weapons of war,&quot; said Prince Vanana Zulu of Kwaminya in KwaZulu-Natal. &quot;No amount of cover-up will blot out from our minds the sad memory of the Shell House Massacre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Inkatha Freedom Party has called for March 28 to be made a national holiday and for the truth commission to find out the facts of the &quot;massacre&quot;.  They want President Nelson Mandela to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was all fairly routine and could have been dispensed with in a press release. They gave a closing prayer and people started dancing again. Then someone got a little trigger-happy. Immediately hundreds of shots popped from all over the square, like packs of firecrackers. I saw several people shooting semi-automatic handguns into the air. One of the gunmen was a couple of metres to my right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people ducked for cover and others fled. But many kept dancing, as the shooting continued. I finally straightened up and ran from the library steps toward Market Street, where police squatted among their Casspirs, aiming into the crowd as Zulus dove for cover. But the police held their fire, most of the shooting stopped, the crowd started marching toward the east, and I emerged unscathed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others were not so fortunate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police put the day's death toll at three: two people at the Merafi Hostel in Soweto and a third at the George Goch Railway Station on Wednesday morning.  About 18 injuries were reported in connection with the march, mostly from gunshot wounds, with a couple of assegai attacks, stone throwings and other assaults thrown in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC compared the march with the 1994 &quot;assault on ANC headquarters&quot; at Shell House and blamed march leaders for leaving &quot;a trail of blood in and around Johannesburg&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party backed the marchers' demands for an investigation into the Shell House shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I wandered back to the newsroom, I was thinking a day in Johannesburg has a bit more pepper than one back home on the plains. Getting mugged, ducking random gunfire, looking down some cop's gun barrel. I sat at my desk, lit another cigarette, and recovered my wallet from my sock.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Confessions by five former policemen have revealed the devious operations of the security police, including the murder of a man working clandestinely for the military. Peta Thornycroft reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORMER northern Transvaal security policeman captain Jacques Hechter has the dubious honour of admitting to more murders than any other confessor to the truth commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his weeks of testimony before the commission, Hechter has confessed that he strangled, burned, shot, kicked and blew up 35 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and his four colleagues - former brigadier Jack Cronje, former warrant officer Paul van Vuuren, former colonel Roelf Venter and warrant officer Wouter Mentz - have collectively admitted to their involvement in the murder of 65 people during their reign of terror in the north.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five dashed to the truth commission's amnesty committee when they learned that the Transvaal attorney general was charging them with 27 murders.  Confessing to the amnesty committee was their only hope for protection from prosecution, though it is not a guarantee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five started to talk after one of their former askaris, Joe Mamesela, began telling his story to investigators at the attorney general's office. He told of a five-year killing spree with his white bosses in the former northern Transvaal security police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mentz, who was a member of the squad that went killing across the border into Botswana, this week partially opened a window into the intrigues within the security forces in their reckless pursuit of their enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mentz was asking for amnesty for the part he played in the murder of Sam Chand and his family, killed in April 1990 in their home across the Botswana border by a squad led by Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was odd about the murder of Chand, who was identified as Kahn in Mentz's testimony, was that he was a paid agent for the Directorate of Covert Collection (DCC), a unit within the Department of Military Intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the information they got from agent Chand, the DCC kept track of weapons leaking across the border from the Pan Africanist Congress' military wing and its Muslim counterpart, Qibla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this day Chand's former handlers are furious about the murder, and mystified as to why a squad from General Basie Smit's security police killed their agent. Not only did the police murder Chand, they also killed his wife, two children, a guard and the family dog. With the death of Chand, the DCC lost their most valuable agent in Botswana. And the policemen who killed him went to elaborate lengths to cover their tracks, to make sure the DCC didn't find out they were involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story of Chand's murder was first told by former policeman Willie Nortje in Denmark when he was on a witness protection programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early 1994 Nortje told investigators for the Goldstone commission how he had taken part in the Botswana raid. He admitted he had shot Chand's wife and then killed another &quot;person&quot; (who turned out to be one of the children) in their beds. He said the group of killers, based at Vlakplaas near Pretoria, had a good relationship with the DCC and laid a false trail to Richards Bay.  De Kock hurt his leg during the raid and had to be carried out by his men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week Mentz, who was a junior policeman at the time of Chand's killing, confirmed much of what Nortje had told the Goldstone commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what was never explained, by Nortje in 1994, nor by Menz this week, was why the South African police wanted to kill Chand. Was it rivalry with the military? Was Chand working for the police as well as the DCC and collecting a double pay cheque? Was it a grotesque mistake?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the truth commission hearing, and through Willem Brits, the lawyer for the five, Mentz said he didn't know Chand had worked for the DCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five said they had also nearly killed another informer, a white member of the National Intelligence Service (NIS)who at the time was involved with anti-apartheid groups at Pretoria University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian spoke to the man who was part of the End Conscription Campaign at the time but denied he ever worked for NIS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five men concluded their testimony this week - possibly the longest and most gruesome for the amnesty committee. Hechter and Cronje are retired from the police, while Van Vuuren and Venter both farm near Warmbaths. Mentz, who wept at the memories of his part in the killings, is still employed by the police.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GAUTENG Housing and Land Affairs MEC Dan Mofokeng will be charged after an unlicensed AK-47 rifle and ammunition were found in his Alberton home last September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rifle was found when a private security company responded to an alarm triggered at his home. Police later said fingerprints found on the rifle did not belong to Mofokeng, and he denied any knowledge of the gun.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Mofokeng was served with a summons to appear in Germiston Regional Court on April 3. He will also be charged with failing to lock his own pistol away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk refuses award</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATIONAL PARTY leader and former president FW de Klerk will not accept the Harper Memorial Fellowship Award from Yale University. De Klerk was to fly to the United States next month to accept the award, presented annually to a person who has made &quot;a distinguished contribution to the public life of the nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But students from the Yale Law School protested, saying that as leader of the former apartheid government De Klerk was an inappropriate choice. They cited what they called his cover-up of post-1990 human rights abuses and the scanty nature of the evidence he presented to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The students said in a press statement that they would still like De Klerk to speak to them, so they can put questions to him they think need to be answered. A spokesman for De Klerk said he withdrew because he did not want to be the cause of conflict on campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBA to look at SABC cuts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) and the SABC will meet next week to look at the report by McKinsey Consultants recommending the SABC cut 1 400 jobs to save R450-million over the next two years. The IBA is concerned the cuts may interfere with the SABC's mandate as public broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in the IBA say that rather than blame its R60-million deficit on the demands of the mandate, the SABC has to admit that it lavished too much money on its extravagant relaunches and its expansion of the shoestring NNTV to SABC3. The SABC says its financial troubles are due in part to its role as a public broadcaster, including requirements by the IBA to accommodate 11 official languages, boost local content and education. The SABC says it cannot be a fully fledged public broadcaster without the full support of the government. The SABC is also facing opposition from its three employee unions, which insist on an investigation of how the SABC got itself into financial trouble in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth commission needs staff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Truth and Reconciliation Commission wants to recruit retired judges and lawyers to help deal with thousands of amnesty applications that must be heard before it shuts down on December 14. More than 5 000 amnesty applications have been submitted, and the number could double by the May 10 cut-off date for submissions. Deputy chair Alex Boraine told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the commission has presented Justice Minister Dullah Omar with a proposal to allow as many amnesty committees as necessary to process the applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boraine ruled out any possibility of a general amnesty and said all applications made before May 10 would be considered. There have been 50 public hearings on amnesty, dealing with gross human rights violations such as murder, torture and abduction. But most applications have been processed in chambers. The commission is to hand its final report to President Nelson Mandela in March 1998.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An independent pathologist is to probe the possibility of foul play in this week's car accident death of Leonard Radu - the police assistant commissioner who was touted to succeed National Commissioner George Fivaz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radu, the most senior former African National Congress cadre in the South African Police Service (SAPS), died early on Wednesday when his car allegedly veered out of control and struck an oncoming vehicle. He died at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radu, who headed SAPS Internal Security - the successor to the old Security Branch - was on his way to Johannesburg International Airport, from where he would have flown to Durban for a &quot;very high- powered meeting&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A family acquaintance said sensitive documents had been recovered from his car and were being checked to ensure the set was complete. The nature of the meeting could not be ascertained, but a representative of Fivaz confirmed Radu would have attended to &quot;official business&quot; in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, also on his way to the airport to fly to Cape Town, passed the scene of the accident shortly after the crash. Mufamadi, who had a close working relationship with Radu, later told the Mail &amp; Guardian he had known Radu was on his way to the airport, but was unaware the accident had involved Radu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the airport, Mufamadi was alerted by phone. He returned to the scene, where he found Radu's body at the roadside. His car had already been removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of police sources have told the M&amp;G that Radu had been regarded as the likely next national commissioner of police. Mufamadi commented: &quot;If he had been advised to assume any major task ... he would put the interest of the country first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi said Radu had been successful as head of Internal Security, a post he assumed in June 1995. &quot;I think that within a relatively short space of time one was feeling he was making a visible impact on our ability to fight crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was not &quot;making any assumptions&quot; about the accident, but that it would be probed. &quot;This is not a natural death. Like all other deaths that are not natural, it will be investigated. Steps are already in place.&quot; Police confirmed Bushy Engelbrecht, director of the police's national special investigations team, would head the probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colleagues and acquaintances this week described Radu as &quot;down-to-earth&quot;, open and easygoing, but said that by virtue of his position he also had enemies. As head of Internal Security he may, for example, have had access to information pinpointing liberation movement impimpis who had spied for the old Security Branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radu, then still with the ANC Department of Intelligence and Security (DIS), also played a key role in events when ANC security personnel killed a number of Zulu marchers in the Shell House shooting before the 1994 elections. He could have been an important witness at the judicial inquest ordered by the Witwatersrand attorney general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An acquaintance of the Radu family this week said an independent pathologist would act on behalf of the family, while Radu's car would also be examined by &quot;people who were his (ANC) comrades&quot;. Acquaintances and colleagues said the accident appeared genuine, but that they were not excluding any possibilities. Said a senior police colleague, also from an ANC background: &quot;(Radu) was certainly a key individual. Obviously a lot of people who think like me wonder if there isn't something more to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC said in a statement mourning Radu's death that he became an underground member of the movement in 1976 and went into exile in 1985. He received military intelligence training in Angola, the Soviet Union and Cuba, and was employed at the ANC's military intelligence section in Lusaka. After his return from exile in 1991 he was appointed head of security in the DIS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The hunt is on for informants in the ANC, report Ann Eveleth, Rehana Rossouw and Peta Thornycroft</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE African National Congress is sitting on information linking one of its prominent provincial members of Parliament in KwaZulu-Natal to the former South African Security Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations about the MPP first surfaced in 1994 following the death of an ANC member believed to have discovered the agent's alleged connection to the security police and its successor, the Crime Information Services Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequent internal probes into the allegations produced the &quot;proof&quot; the ANC was looking for, which included the man's police identity number - information which has now been handed to senior officials in the Department of Safety and Security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC KwaZulu-Natal representative Dumisane Makhaye said exposure of apartheid-era informants was &quot;an essential condition for national reconciliation and healing. This becomes even more important in the case of KwaZulu-Natal which bore the brunt of &quot;third force&quot; activities. The network is still intact and functioning,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five former security policemen who told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week that there were people in government &quot;structures&quot; who spied on anti- apartheid activists were referring to operatives who hold office at a fairly low level The security police in the Northern Transvaal during the late 1980s operated on a regional basis and were unlikely to have recruited spies with a national profile. Those agents were usually handled by head office in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the men - Jack Cronje, Paul van Vuuren, Roelf Venter and Wouter Mentz - were told they do not have to identify their former agents to the truth commission's amnesty committee, they have talked among themselves about their spies. And there are no national names among those they mention. The highest ranking are two city councillors who worked in their region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men's former askari, Joe Mamesela, last week told the New Nation there are five Cabinet ministers who were paid police informers. He has not divulged any names or explained how he came across the information at a time when informers with such a high profile were handled at head office level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Names of several top ANC leaders appeared as regular contacts on National Intelligence Service documents after the National Party government and the ANC began meeting secretly in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was regular contact between national ANCchairman Jacob Zuma, Deputy Intelligence Services Minister Joe Nhlanhla and Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad with the National Intelligence Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the PW Botha administration approved of the meetings, it covered its back in the event of a leak. The meetings could have been explained as an intelligence-gathering exercise. As a result, the senior ANC members involved in the ground-breaking meetings were allocated source numbers. Some ANC stalwarts believe these numbers are now being used to suggest they were informing on their organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission had neither &quot;the time nor the resources to sniff out informers&quot;, deputy chair Alex Boraine said on Thursday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The South Africa-based exiled King Leka I of Albania is poised to return to his troubled homeland in a bid to end widespread civil unrest and the threat of armed revolt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 57-year-old pretender to the throne left his Johannesburg home earlier this week in anticipation of a call from his people and is believed to be somewhere in Europe, awaiting their call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encouraged by news that the beleaguered President Sali Berisha had agreed to call early elections, following weeks of violent protest from people angered by the collapse of pyramid schemes - in which thousands have lost their life savings - the king says he is the only person able to unify Albania.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviewed at his heavily guarded Bryanston home before he flew out, the king said it was imperative free and fair elections be preceded by a national referendum to decide on a constitutional monarchy or a republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, he wants to return. &quot;If the people choose to restore the monarchy, then I shall accept the heavy responsibility that will place upon my shoulders. If they choose a republican constitution, then I am willing to return as a private citizen and share my people's efforts to r build a free and stable society,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a law passed by the former communist regime the king is not allowed to enter Albania. When he did in 1993, his hotel was surrounded by troops and he was forced to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current instability has given him hope for a triumphant return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was only two days old when Mussolini's armies invaded Albania in 1939, forcing his father, King Zog, to flee into exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family lived in Europe before ending up in the former Rhodesia, but were chased out when Robert Mugabe took power. They ended up in South Africa where King Leka now lives on contributions from sympathisers and &quot;friendly countries&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Alan Gray, chief executive of the Mpumalanga Parks Board who led the controversial Dolphin natures reserves deal, has wide business interests in the area, reports Justin Arenstein</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE man who led Mpumalanga Parks Board into a controversial nature reserve deal with the Dubai-based Dolphin Group owns companies that hold lucrative contracts with the parks board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also emerged this week that Alan Gray's attempts to use an alleged letter from Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi to vindicate Dolphin's Kenyan owner has prompted a full blown investigation by Kenyan authorities who deny the letter's existence. Gray has failed to co-operate with the probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray, the parks board's chief executive, operates tourism, transport and medical companies in the province, all of which enjoy the parks board's patronage. Gray is also a consultant to the state-owned board, commanding a private sector salary allegedly worth around R50 000 a month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banking group Absa told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that it is investigating Gray in connection with the transfer of funds between various bank accounts and the depositing of cheques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray brokered the deal with Dolphin last November, handing the company a commercial monopoly over Mpumalanga's key tourism attractions, including the Blyde River Canyon, various state-owned game reserves and Pilgrims Rest. The deal - in which Dolphin would bankroll the parks board in exchange for exclusive rights over the sites for the next 50 years - was revised last week following a public outcry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray declined to specify his salary this week. The province's environmental affairs MEC David Mkhwanazi, however, said Gray's pay was based on what a private sector managing director, who controlled a company with an asset base equivalent to the board, would earn, plus a performance-related element.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G found that all parks board employees are contractually obliged to take out membership with Gray's medical rescue company, Life Crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray said this week that the board had employed the company without following normal tendering procedures, but that he had recused himself from that decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray's company took over the contract last year after Lowveld Helicopter Services (LHS) - in which Gray owns a large stake - brought an urgent liquidation order against Life Crisis's predecessor, snapping up its assets just before the order was served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LHS holds the majority of the parks board's aerial game counting, darting and capture contracts. Most other provincial government departments, including Mkhwanazi's department and Premier Mathews Phosa's office also extensively use LHS, without tender procedures being followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LHS contracts have included &quot;flips&quot; around the province for the now- disgraced former government consultant, Eugene Nyati, trips by Phosa and colleagues, as well as sightseeing tours by Dolphin executives. LHS also flew a parks board and legislative delegation to Cape Town two weeks ago in a King Air fixed-wing plane. It provided a helicopter to M-Net's Carte Blanche while they filmed an insert on the Dolphin deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray refused to say how much the board had spent with LHS, insisting such information could be demanded only by the provincial legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, however, LHS staff suddenly stopped using the company's name when answering the phone, and instead welcomed callers to &quot;Air Excellence&quot;.  Staff said all LHS assets, staff, contracts and helicopters had been transferred to Air Excellence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray also refused to comment on an alleged R3,5-million breach of contract lawsuit against LHS and against him by Rip Hopkins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian- registered helicopter company TyvmenAviaTrans. Regional TyvmenAviaTrans manager Andre Denasov said the company had entered a joint venture with LHS in 1993 but was still allegedly owed profits and staff expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other companies in which Gray has interests include: Helicopter Investment Services, Eastern Transvaal Ambulance Services, Emergency Vehicle Hire Services, Corridor Management Services, Eagle Helicopters and Zambian Tours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The row with the Kenyans was sparked last month after Gray insisted that he had a letter from Arap Moi clearing the Dolphin president, Ketan Somaia, of any dubious business dealings or other scandals in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has since refused to make copies of the letter public, or take calls from Kenya's High Commissioner in South Africa, Justice Mudavadi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existence of the letter, which allegedly clears Somaia of all wrongdoing in a R35-million security equipment tender, has been repeatedly denied by Arap Moi's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not care about the contract or the deal,&quot; Mudavadi says. &quot;But the use of our president's name is serious. Despite phoning Gray numerous times over the past three weeks, &quot;I have failed to speak to him or even get past his secretary - instead I am always told he is out or in meetings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possibility that Gray had been given a fraudulent letter, signed in the name of the president and clearing Somaia, had been considered, Kenyan authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray has previously insisted that he cannot make the letter public until he receives counsel from his and Somaia's legal advisors. He again refused to respond to questions about the letter this week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Perhaps the Afrikaans phrases are the most apposite. They talk of murg en been in the context of nothing left behind; nothing left to give. On two fronts, this has real meaning for South African rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our latest national coach, Carel du Plessis, had this quality of never giving up, seldom deviating from his chosen business of crossing the tryline.  It made him the prince of the wings of his era. Gert Smal, the man he has named as his assistant, was also one who gave everything down to the very marrow of his bones in pursuing the less flashy task of forward play. It earned him the nickname Tarzan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together, one feels, they have much to give the game in this country.  Whether that can be translated into pushing the Springboks to new levels remains to be proven in a tough 13-Test season ahead, but there can be no doubt that the vital ingredients are all there in our new national management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That only gets its chance to be showcased for the first time when South Africa take on Tonga on June 10 in a warm-up for the tour of the British Lions. Right now, the realities for the game in this country are centred on Super 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this respect, the qualities of inner toughness and playing through the full 80 minutes are especially relevant if Du Plessis and Smal are to apply their own in- built criteria to the three-nation southern hemisphere provincial championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For, while Du Plessis has - rightly - said that he will not ignore the claims of foreign-based players such as Francois Pienaar and Joel Stransky, it is largely from among the ranks of the players on display in the Super 12 that he will shortlist the 27 players who will make up his initial Springbok squad of 21 for the Tongan Test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, Du Plessis will take some pleasure from the performances of Natal, Transvaal, Northern Transvaal and - even though they have yet to register a win - Free State in the toughest competition in world rugby below international level</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, that said, he will surely also be concerned by the seeming inability of both Natal and Transvaal to sustain their defensive walls through to the final whistle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natal can hardly be faulted in racking up a record 75-43 victory over the Otago Highlanders in the muggy heat of Durban last weekend. Yet questions on how, with such dominance and with 50-point debutant Gavin Lawless in such superb form, they managed to concede six tries to a team outplayed for most of the game. Not even the fierce Durban humidity can be blamed for that.  Otago is not renowned for beachfront weather, and yet they seemed to adapt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend, Natal have a chance to contemplate the margin of their success and tally their defensive failures before taking on the Brumbies at Kings Park on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Transvaal, there is less respite. And they, too, have some thinking to do before taking on the inventive Highlanders at Ellis Park in a Friday evening floodlit game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In atrocious - at least by local standards - weather, Kobus Wiese's men let slip a 20- point lead in the last quarter hour of a match they had sewn up, despite struggling in the line-outs against the ACT Brumbies. For the final 44-36 scoreline could have shrunk even further if Brumbies flyhalf John Knox had landed a last-minute penalty. But then perhaps this is carping. Transvaal played the majority of the match without a lock after Hannes Strydom went off streaming blood from a kick over the eye. The refereeing also left something to be desired, although that was true for both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it was, after all, enough to put Wiese's men on top of the Super 12 log.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Northerns on their way to the Antipodes and an opening away encounter against ACT next Friday, it is left for Free State to fill out the local fixtures. The Bloemfontein side have played willing and attractive - if not winning - rugby and will surely be counting on opening their account against Queensland on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And through all of these matches, Du Plessis will be weighing the commitment of the available players against the standards he will set for his squad. Expect some extra fire this weekend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There was a time when clubs in Rio de Janeiro needed look no further than the nearest side street, car park, beach or backyard for the next crop of football talent. Young players seemed to sprout like the weeds in the wasteground where they would hone their skills until it was too dark to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the city has grown, concrete has been poured over the grass, bringing offices and apartments where once there were t-shirts as goalposts.  Now cars, not kids, rule the streets. Suddenly a country that has given the world so many of its greatest players is worried that the next generation has nowhere to learn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Primary among those concerned is Zico, for many Brazilians still the best player the country has produced since Pele. Zico, a fit-looking 44-year-old who took his skills to three World Cups, laments that the football pitches and open spaces where he learned his trade have disappeared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over in Quintino (a Rio suburb) where I used to live there were eight grass pitches. Now it's all buildings, flats and housing. In my day there were many football pitches throughout Rio. I think we have lost the chance to have many great players because of the lack of space to play football in the street, so many people look for another route. If you're not going to play football, you're going to go for basketball, for video games, for volleyball, or go to the beach to surf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Rio still has its beaches where young cariocas can hone their football skills, but even there you are as likely to find a game of volleyball, or that typically Brazilian hybrid, fute-volei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zico, though, has done more than sit and grumble about it, the proof of which, the Zico Football Centre, boasts some of the best facilities for schoolboy football in Rio. He says the reason he built the centre - in Barra, a new addition to Rio's beachfront sprawl about 30km down the coast from Copacabana - was that he had a boys' team with nowhere to play in the area.  Zico's wealth, built up in a career that took him to Italy and Japan, helped turn a frustrated manager's dream into reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The football school takes boys from the age of six up to 17, separated into five age- group categories. The parents pay a fee but there is a sliding scale of bursaries, and some pay nothing. About 700 kids have been signed up for this year's course. The facilities are impressive. Several pitches of various sizes boast some of the best- looking turf in Rio. There is a gym and an administration block, including the inevitable shop selling Zico merchandise. Zico himself wears his Zico Centre strip to the office, albeit with the addition of a briefcase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first objective is to give these kids the opportunity to play real football, on grass, on a field, because here isn't just a place for those who want to go on to play professional football. We've got many kids who come here, play and don't have any interest in being professionals. Their parents send the kids here because it's a nice, pleasant place; they're safe and the place has a positive attitude. We want to prepare citizens, not just footballers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For an example of a responsible citizen, the kids need look no further than Zico himself. In his playing days with Brazil's most popular club Flamengo, he was a model professional, a clean-living family man devoted to his wife.  On his wall is a framed certificate from the Father's Day Council of something called the Japan Men's Fashion Unity, praising him as a role model.  It is an honour that has eluded bad boys such as Romario, the current hero of the Flamengo faithful, whose lifestyle has prompted some uncomplimentary exchanges with his illustrious predecessor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In professional terms, Romario and Maradona are good examples because they are winners, they won titles,&quot; Zico says. &quot;In social terms, without a doubt they are terrible examples because of the life they lead. Maradona is a bad example because of the drugs and Romario is a bad example because he's a party person, a nightclub man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Romario's changing, he's living a different sort of life from the one he used to, because he understands that he needs to look after his body to be able to perform on the field. If not, he'll never be the player he's capable of being.&quot; Zico's image made him an ideal choice to help launch the J-League in Japan, where he enjoyed an Indian summer at the end of his career playing for Kashima Antlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He returned to Rio in 1994 to set up his school, but he remains the technical director of Kashima Antlers and divides his time between Brazil and Japan. The Antlers spent last month in Rio doing their pre- season training at Zico's centre, completing a happy and profitable circle. &quot;Japan was good for me financially,&quot; Zico says. &quot;I built this place thanks to my time in Japan.&quot; He estimates that his project has cost him Pounds 1,25-million to Pounds 1,85- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The son of a Portuguese immigrant father, Zico was born Artur Antunes Coimbra. He spent 22 years at Flamengo, before and after his two-year stint in Italy with Udinese, and is still closely associated with the club. In 1981, a Zico-led Flamengo won the South American championship and then went on to beat Liverpool 3-1 - then at the peak of their powers - in Tokyo to claim the world club title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although at the 1978, 1982 and 1986 World Cups much was expected of Brazil's &quot;white Pele&quot;, Zico's potential was never quite fulfilled on the biggest stage of all. In part this was because of the under- achievement of the teams of which he was part, particularly the 1982 side, which lost 3-2 to Italy in the quarter-finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those kids with ability who want more out of their time at the Zico centre than just becoming better citizens, Zico has another project bubbling away. &quot;If they've got talent, we're not just going to spend all our time coaching them for someone else. So I created a football team, Rio de Janeiro FC, that's going to take part in the Rio de Janeiro state championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I want to do is in three years' time have a professional team of kids who've graduated from here.&quot; The idea is to enter Rio de Janeiro FC in the third division of the state championship and progress up the divisions and break the dominance of the big four Rio clubs - Flamengo, Fluminense, Botafogo and Vasco da Gama. Plans are afoot to build a couple of stands around the centre's main pitch that should provide room for 4 000 spectators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fixture between the great Rio rivals Flamengo and Fluminense - the Fla- Flu - is one of the great derbies of the world, but Zico's ambition is that in 10 years' time the game between Flamengo and his own Rio de Janeiro FC will enjoy a similar status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now my team's supporters are the parents and friends of the players.  When they start doing well, they could attract a lot of people, a whole set of youngsters who aren't committed to a club. So I hope that in 10 years we could have a great match between Rio de Janeiro and Flamengo. It's hard to say who I'd support.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Coaches of South African teams don't have it easy, but coaching Nigeria's Super Eagles is even harder</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PERHAPS there are more difficult assignments than coaching the Nigerian national football team. Swimming a crocodile-infested river or walking blindfolded across a minefield spring to mind, but the list is pretty short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when former Kaizer Chiefs coach Philippe Troussier gazed skywards after accepting the R45 000-a-month post as manager of the star-studded Super Eagles, he was surely seeking divine inspiration. If goalkeepers are crazy, what can one make of coaches, with the South African variety in danger of becoming extinct as success-obsessed club officials hire and fire with gay abandon and spectators bay for blood at the slightest excuse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troussier may be crazy, but he is also extremely brave because the post he has accepted is fraught with dangers, including government interference at the highest level and financial promises that are not kept. Dutchman Clemens Westerhof (a notable casualty amid the South African coaching mayhem of recent years) survived longer than most in the hottest seat in Africa, guiding Nigeria to victory in the 1994 African Nations Cup. He also took the Super Eagles to the 1994 World Cup in the United States, where they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory against Italy, conceding a last-minute equaliser and an extra-time penalty kick, which the Divine Ponytailed Roberto Baggio converted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Westerhof never returned to Nigeria, with physical threats from some players left out of the starting line-up probably influencing his decision to terminate a largely successful five-year reign. Local Amodu Shaibu took charge only for the Eagles to slip from their lofty pedestal and when the inevitable search for another foreign coach was concluded, Dutchman Jo Bonfrere got the nod. Although Bonfrere was not a big name in the coaching world, he had worked for several years under Westerhof and quickly turned the tide, bringing the Afro-Asian Nations Cup to Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A political quarrel with South Africa, triggered by the hanging of nine minority rights activists in Port Harcourt, deprived Bonfrere of a chance to emulate Westerhof in the Nations Cup as the Eagles refused to defend the title in Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere quit soon after, dissatisfied with his financial rewards and disillusioned with constant interference from various levels of authority, including the right honourable minister of sport. The lure of leading Nigeria at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics proved too strong, however, and Bonfrere returned to mastermind victory over Argentina in a thrilling final, and a place among the football records as the first African gold medallists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of returning to West Africa as a national hero, Bonfrere adjusted his sights to the dollar-saturated Middle East and landed a post as national coach of lightweight football nation Qatar. Shaibu was back in charge when the qualifying campaign for the 1998 World Cup began with an unimpressive 2-0 home victory over Burkina Faso and a 1-1 draw in Kenya merely confirmed that the end was nigh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian football officials wanted a big name with Kevin Keegan and Johan Cruyff topping a list which read like a Who's Who of international coaching.  However, idealism was soon replaced by realism. It came down to a fight between two Frenchmen experienced in African football, Troussier and Claude le Roy, German Buckhardt Ziese, who had coached Ghana, and Hungarian Kalman Meszoly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ziese was rated highest by the Nigerian Football Association technical committee and the interview panel, but Troussier got the job because he was active in Africa with Moroccan second division club Fath Union Sportive. The boyish-looking Frenchman with medium-length brown hair probably ranks beside German Reinhard Fabisch as the best foreign coaches to work in South Africa this decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troussier left Chiefs in late 1994 because some players complained of his demanding style. Before arriving in Johannesburg, the &quot;White Wizard&quot; had coached ASEC and the national team in the Ivory Coast. Now he has accepted what many cynics would consider the poisoned chalice of African football. &quot; With 100 million people and God backing me, I pledge to take Nigeria to France,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His first competitive assignment comes on April 5 at home to group pace- setters Guinea and anything other than victory is unthinkable for a man with much to gain and even more to lose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This week at the world indoor championships in Paris another male bastion fell. Duncan Mackay tells the unfinished story of pride and prejudice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WOMEN are allowed to serve in the armed services, pilot aeroplanes and run the country. But they are still considered too fragile to compete in some athletics events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since Baron Pierre de Coubertin revived the Olympics more than a century ago, female athletes have been fighting to be given the same opportunities as their male counterparts. De Coubertin disapproved of women competing in sports and they were not allowed to take part in track and field until the Antwerp Games in 1928, 32 years after the modern Olympics were founded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle to overcome that prejudice has resembled trench warfare: long and attritional. For women, the marathon - a classic Olympic event - was added to the Games in Los Angeles only in 1984, the 10 000m in Seoul in 1988 and the 5 000m and triple jump in Atlanta last year. Another male bastion fell in Paris this week when the pole vault made its debut at the world indoor championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The winner collected not only the gold medal but a purse of $50 000, as prize money was awarded for the first time by the International Amateur Athletic Federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pole vault is the most technical - and dangerous - event in track and field. The best exponents are those, like the men's world-record holder Sergei Bubka, who ally speed and strength with flexibility. The pole absorbs the vaulter's kinetic energy then releases it to propel her upwards. She then has to pivot on the pole, shoot her feet over the bar and push the pole away from the crossbar. It can take years to learn to successfully combine the different elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emma George is a former trapeze artist who discovered pole vaulting only 18 months ago. She has set eight world records. &quot;She's the biggest thing we've had for ages in track and field,&quot;' says Damien Booth of Athletics Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amount of people wanting to talk to her and promote products is amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities used to point to (now outdated) medical research that claimed events like the pole vault and triple jump were potentially damaging to the uterus as the reason for keeping women out of the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Change is hard for people,&quot; said Jeff Robbins, a leading US pole vault coach. &quot;The doors are opening and people are going to walk through. It's a kind of mindset that pole vaulting is supposed to be a macho event with big, tough guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet pole vaulting is in many ways more gymnastics than athletics because it requires speed, strength, timing, concentration, mobility and suppleness. &quot; I've heard people say women can't vault, they don't have upper-body strength,&quot; says Robbins. &quot;Then I'll go to a meet with some of my girls, and the coaches leave and it's 'Oh, when can our girls start vaulting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There still remains unease in some quarters, however, about whether pole vaulting is truly safe for women. Kate Staples, Britain's most famous female exponent, has heard all the arguments. &quot;I don't see how it can be any more dangerous than gymnastics,&quot; she said. &quot;People still criticise women's triple- jumping, but there's no evidence it does any harm. Until they can prove it's dangerous, they should leave us alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staples missed the Paris event through injury, but it was not sustained pole vaulting. The former British record holder hurt her back while filming an episode of Gladiators, in which she plays Zodiac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical argument has long been exposed but it is still regularly trotted out by ill-informed critics. &quot;It goes back to Victorian days when people thought that by taking part in this type of event they wouldn't be able to have our children,&quot; says Brian Hooper, the former UK record holder who introduced Staples to pole vaulting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pregnancy line was once used to discourage women from taking part in marathons but world-class athletes of the calibre of Liz McColgan and Ingrid Kristiansen have proved that long-distance running is no hindrance to motherhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's pole vaulting has taken off since the IAAF officially recognised the event in 1993. The world record has been broken often during the past three years and it appears that the frequency will be maintained. More and more women in Britain are being attracted to the event - drawn by its growing opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated that 20 000 girls and women are vaulting in the United States, 12 000 of them in high school - a youth movement that will be difficult to hold back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris marked another important battle won, but the war continues. The women's pole vault will not be contested at the world championships in Athens this year - though it will be included in the 1999 event - and the steeplechase and hammer are still missing from the women's championship programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The notion that women can't do something is ludicrous,&quot; says Robbins. &quot; Instead of looking at what they can't do, let's focus on teaching them how to do what they want to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The selectors are right to bring in some young blood against the Australians, but they also need the coolness of experience in the heat of battle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN times of crisis, it is a very human response to bring in the strength and exuberance of youth. Here, you feel, is the next link in the on-going chain of life. So it has ever been with wars, those fought out in earnest between armed nations and largely without the normal rules governing civilised society, and those simulated battles demarcated by the structured gentility of sporting competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this hot freshness of blood though, the wise campaigners tend to add the seasoning of experience, in much the same manner as a chef adds the sweetness of herbs to the acidity of wine in balancing the preparation of a fine meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is with the South African cricket side presently engaged in rescuing some honour and respect at St George's Park in Port Elizabeth, by attempting to reverse the emphatic innings and 196-run defeat at the hands of Mark Taylor's Australians inflicted at the Wanderers just under a fortnight ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Jacques Kallis, Adam Bacher, Herschelle Gibbs and Paul Adams, we are presented with the vanguard of the host of young players who will be charged with carrying the South African colours into the international arena for at least the next decade. It is no mean task, given the still raw wounds of the first Test and the savaging the side was given by the critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the return of Brian McMillan and the call-up issued to veteran Pat Symcox, the selectors have managed a seasoning of Hansie Cronje's side aimed at collectively working together to erase the bitterness of the Wanderers defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little wrong in applying selectorial conservatism to what is inherently a game based on this part of the human spirit. For those who do not recognise this aspect of cricket - dulled of senses as we have become by the bludgeoning brute force of the one-day game - it is well to reflect on one Australian innings in the first Test as proof when weighed against the fragile batting of the South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Waugh might well have taken second spot to Greg Blewett's 214 in the scorebookks, but Taylor was right in pointing to Waugh's innings as the cornerstone of the winning Australian first innings total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waugh did everything right, playing each ball on merit. More particularly, he played his innings to the first principle of Test batting: the crease belongs to the batsman and it is for the bowler to deny him that right. Waugh took occupation of his demarcated domain with the confidence of knowing that anything not directed at the stumps was a bonus for him, either in runs from the loose ball or in just another wasted effort from the bowler as he left it alone outside the stumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a signal lesson in true appreciation of the art of batting and of the relaxed confidence that only understanding the depths of concentration required to build an innings of stature requires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also - hopefully - a lesson that the South Africans will have taken very much to heart, for it epitomised the flinty hardness of the way the men from Down Under approach the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geoff Boycott, the brash Yorkshire and England batsman-turned love-him-or- leave- him commentator, was arguably the most boring batsman in the world to watch. There were even times when his teammates would willingly have strangled him when a run chase was required. But our Geoffrey understood above all that occupation of the crease was what ultimately counted. In short, he understood Test cricket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the last thing anyone in this country would wish on the South African team is a touch of the Boycotts, there is much to be taken from his philosophy. The game at the top level owes more to grafting conservatism than it does to the dashing 'lan of consecutive boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daryll Cullinan, whose inborn class is in such sharp contrast to his apparent lack of concentration when he looks really set, could do worse than watch a few old tapes of Boycott in action. To compare them would be folly on two counts. Boycott never had the fluidity of the South African; Cullinan will seemingly never have the head-down grit of the dour Yorkshireman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National coach Bob Woolmer and his revamped side - without Andrew Hudson and Jonty Rhodes this time out - have a difficult task in settling on a game plan against an Australian combination that bats deep and determinedly and bowls directly and decisively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are lessons to be learnt by all concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As batsmen, there is the sure knowledge that Glenn McGrath is no panty- waist quickie. His brutal battering of Kallis in the first innings of the Wanderers Test showed that ... a simple question of one in the ribs, one in the nasties and then one to reach despairingly at before departing to salve both the inner and outer aches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGrath is a fine bowler, unhampered by compassion on the field. His displeasure at the cavalier way Adams treated his bowling at the end of the opening innings - and his subsequent reference to the young spinner as a wanker - show just how serious he is about his task. Jason Gillespie, is vastly more inexperienced than McGrath but equally single-minded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's batting also has to overcome the not inconsiderable hurdle of Shane Warne, rapidly putting his post-operative problems behind him and an even more cerebral creator of opportunities than he was when he last visited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cullinan looked to be falling under the wrist spinner's thrall in the hang- dog second innings and again, it was Kallis who was taught the lesson of never underestimating the Australians, by being bowled round his legs. This is not what the cricketing gods intended number three batsmen to fall prey to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As bowlers there are also some things to ponder on. As demonstrated by Waugh and Blewett, the wide ball only makes a mark on the scorer's sheet. The Aussies do not chase deliveries best handled by the wicketkeeper. Neither are they intimidated by the short ball. They have grown up hooking and pulling pacemen and, on a track as flat as the Wanderers proved to be, repeated use of the bouncer represents more folly than fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Adams, it must be said that he looked the most rounded and competent of the South African attack in the opening encounter, and at St George's Park will hopefully get the assistance from the pitch he was denied in his wicketless effort in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly young Adams was treated with a modicum of respect by the Australians, and you always get the feeling that he manages to combine both the sheer enjoyment of him doing what he is engaged in with a determination as steely as anything the Aussies can produce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is well that Kallis, Bacher, Gibbs and Adams are having to learn the toughest part of Test cricket so young and against such uncompromising opposition. It will stand them individually, and this country as a whole, well in a future currently being mapped out in Port Elizabeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the simple expedient of an infusion of youth cannot be seen as a national panacea, one senses that, despite being 1-0 down in the three-Test series, all is not gloom and despondency. We still have the players to fight back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For, do not forget that Cronje and his side battled their way back to defeat Ken Rutherford's New Zealanders two seasons ago. So it is well to relegate the inept performance in the first Test to the realms of the record books and focus on the job ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then use some application and concentration from the veterans like Donald, McMillan, Cronje, Gary Kirsten and Dave Richardson. Draw from the experience of seasons past ... and add to it the youthful look of seasons yet to come. It is the only way the sporting chain can continue unbroken.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Despite the lingering suspicion in international circles that Cape Town sneaked in through the back door to become a finalist in the race to host the 2004 Olympic Games, the Mother City can now count itself as a very real contender for the elusive prize which will be awarded by the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) 113 members on September 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while there are still those who believe that Cape Town will struggle to organise the biggest show on earth, the IOC is clearly not among their number.  &quot;No city gets to this stage of the Olympic bid without the IOC being completely satisfied that it is capable of hosting the Olympic Games successfully because each of the cities in the final group can win,&quot; says Bid Company CEO Chris Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was made quite clear to us that the IOC has every confidence in each one of the cities. So we start with the same certificate of approval, if you like, as the other cities and it's now down to the election process.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the high technical standard of the five finalist cities - Athens, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Rome and Stockholm - it is expected that other factors will now play an important role in the eventual outcome, and it is here that the geopolitical card will weigh in heavily for both Cape Town and Buenos Aires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Europe having missed out on two Olympic Games - after Atlanta and then Sydney won the last two bids - traditionalists now claim that the Games should return to the continent which has hosted 14 of the 23 Summer Olympic Games to date. But as the nomination of Atlanta to host the Centennial Olympic Games showed only too well, tradition counts for little these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the advent of modern telecommunications and the global village - which is matched by the equally pervasive global economy - the means to consume and fund the Games are no longer a critical consideration. The IOC too is a global organisation and it increasingly likes to be seen as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside of Europe, and particularly in the United States - the country with the most Olympic clout because its television and corporate dollars underwrite the Games - there is growing currency to the question of whether the Olympics should not rather go to South America or Africa for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although the IOC's 113-strong membership is still heavily weighted in favour of Europe with its 48 members, many of the other members could favour the two outsiders. Indeed, Buenos Aires - which received an extremely favourable appraisal by the IOC's evaluation commission - is now considered a real threat to the three European candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town too is the focus of serious discussion by informed commentators.  Although in the final analysis it is impossible to say how anybody votes in the secret ballot employed by the IOC in the election and talk of voting blocks is viewed with some scepticism, Africa's 20 members - along with some of the Asian, Caribbean and Australasian countries who might identify with Cape Town's cause - could also play a leading role in September's big showdown in Lausanne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is certain is that this year's election is likely to be the most closely and keenly contested yet and it is the lobbying campaign over the next six months that will prove crucial. For the five cities this will mean rolling out the red carpet for as many IOC members, international sports federation heads and other people of influence in Olympic circles as can be enticed into paying a visit and this phase of the bid does not come cheap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is particularly so when you sit at the bottom of Africa and have to fork out first class air tickets for a few hundred people. &quot;We plan to spend around R40-million over the next few months,&quot; says Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there were claims from bid insiders in January that the Bid Company was technically insolvent, Ball says there is no cause for concern over funding for the coming campaign. &quot;We have not got cash in the bank but we have a strong commitment from our sponsors who provide money on an ongoing basis,&quot; says Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bid's financial director, Michael Fuller, elaborates further. &quot;Our liabilities at the end of December were greater than our assets but we had R23- million in signed contracts coming in at the end of January. From an operational point of view it was just a difference in cash flow but we are not insolvent. We are probably always going to operate close to that anyway because of the way our contracts are structured,&quot; says Fuller.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bid Company is still looking for another R20-million according to Fuller but R3,6-million of that was pledged earlier this week when the Cape Metropolitan Council, board of directors, Industrial Development Corporation and Grinaker Construction made contributions. The deficit in required funds has led to rumours within the bid this week that Raymond Ackerman - who parted company with the bid in acrimonious circumstances in 1995 - could be back in some capacity together with an increased sponsorship from Pick 'n Pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the R40-million to be spent in the run- up to September, R12-million is for the international lobbying campaign, R8-million for international and local marketing as well as consultation with local communities, and approximately R5-million for sports events to promote the bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These events - the world fencing championships and the junior world championships for both cycling and weightlifting - cannot afford to go wrong and the Bid Company must commit itself to them to ensure they are more like the highly successful world cross country championships than the disastrous modern pentathlon world cup final of last year. The rest of the R40-million will go on the normal running costs of the bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ball believes that &quot;our task is to get the members of the IOC to fall in love with Cape Town, appreciate its charms, understand the spirit of the city and see what kind of opportunity the Games offer for Cape Town. They must realise that ours is not just an Olympic dream. It can be done and it will have a major impact on this region of the world at vast credit to the IOC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as close observers of Olympic bidding are only too aware, convincing some IOC members of the merits of a city's bid is not always enough to secure their votes. The often quoted Lords of the Rings and its follow up The New Lords of Rings - intriguing exposes of the inner workings of the IOC - provide clear evidence that some IOC members are not averse to taking bidding cities for a ride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IOC, ever conscious of its image, has produced strict guidelines outlining limitations on the number of companions IOC members can take with them, the length of their stay and the value of gifts they may receive. These rules, however, are almost impossible to enforce and infringements are seldom reported. If they do come to light it is only after the election is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The IOC asked in the briefing session on Friday afternoon that all the cities comply with the bidding rules and of course we will do that,&quot; says Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those cities which follow Cape Town's route of honest endeavour could find themselves at a major disadvantage, however, against a city like Rome. The de facto head of Rome's bid is the wily street fighter of sporting politics, Primo Nebiolo - the president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation being one of his many sporting titles - and his dubious methods of winning elections are legendary. Just like Ben Johnson in the Games themselves some people will stop at nothing to win the biggest prize of all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The CNA Literary Award is no more. SHAUN DE WAAL looks back at its successes and failures, and asks some questions about a future prize</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER 35 years, the CNA Literary Award has come to an end. Some might accuse this paper of having helped to kill it - after all, Sarah Ruden, who won in the English category last year for her volume of poems, Other Places, reacted strongly to our flippant comment about the award &quot;haemorrhaging glamour&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this paper's fault, she wrote, that the award lacks that elusive quality (she fingered no other publication). It is the Mail &amp; Guardian which should have provided the CNA award with glamour by paying it more attention than we did in what turned out to be its final year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps we could have done more. Perhaps it was only the newspapers that were left without any sense of excitement as the prize plodded on, moving year by year from a ballroom in Sandton to the foyer of the Market Theatre, from the Grahamstown festival to the Linder Auditorium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then again the CNA Literary Award - as its name indicates - was a marketing tool of a particular company, and it was as a marketing tool that it failed. (The company will focus instead on basic literacy education.) By the late Eighties, the public had ceased to associate the CNA chain of stationers and booksellers with the kind of books that win prizes like the one that bore its name. It was impossible to find the winning books, let alone those merely shortlisted, in most of the chain's stores. What had the CNA, taking itself ever downmarket, to gain from awarding such a prize?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that journalists began to lose interest in the CNA award - thus, as Ruden claims, robbing it of some of its prestige by ignoring it - is perhaps in part due to the fact that the M-Net Book Prize was louder, brasher and more aggressively promoted. It was competition the CNA award apparently could not handle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is not to say that the award does not have a distinguished history, as Brian Green shows in &quot;This Beacon in Our Murky Lives&quot; (the quote is from 1966 winner Thelma Gutsche), a study of the award's first 20 years, published in the latest English Academy Review. It was a marketing tool that aided literature; as much as it promoted the name of a shop, the award drew attention to work its judges considered exceptional and thereby helped keep alive the ideals of excellent writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Green points out, the prize also served a political purpose: &quot;During this era of increasingly stringent state control, the opportunity the CNA accorded the prize- winning author to make a first-hand statement on the conditions of literary production in contemporary South Africa was one of the greatest achievements in the history of this literary award.&quot; Andr' Brink and others certainly made good use of their time at the podium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CNA Literary Award itself, too, especially in the person of Layton Slater, chairman from 1978, &quot;took up the cause against censorship, vigorously and implacably&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To read the list of those who have won the CNA Literary Award over the last 35 years is to track the development of an indigenous literary pantheon.  Those with the most laurels are Brink, JM Coetzee, and Nadine Gordimer.  Receiving the prize in 1990 for My Son's Story, Gordimer said she would not enter the award in future as she felt it should go to emerging writers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prize would answer that need a year later by creating a category for debut work, a fine way to promote new writers. It also, belatedly, reorganised categories that had tended, in any one year, to pit, say, a guide to yachting against a complex psychological novel. Sensibly, non-fiction and &quot; creative&quot; work (fiction and poetry) were split into separate areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hearteningly, a new prize will take the place of the CNA Literary Award. It will be associated with CNA-Gallo subsidiary Exclusive Books rather than CNA itself, which does make more marketing sense. Exclusive Books managing director Fred Withers says the company is taking a cautious approach, consulting widely with publishers and writers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It must be hoped that between them they will come up with a new prize worthy of the respect commanded by the CNA award at its height. There are, at any rate, some pointers for debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunday Times Alan Paton Award for non- fiction was once paired with the CNA prize. Now it exists proudly in its own right, and might offer a model of how to proceed. It is neatly focused in its requirements and it has the benefit of in-house publicity through the newspaper. It might be argued that the new award should define itself in contra-distinction to the Paton, and go to fiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, though, would put it in competition again with M-Net's well-funded prize - though that has attempted to position itself as more &quot;popular&quot; and slightly less literary. Such a distinction may be more or less meaningful in any given year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's Whitbread Prize is given in various categories (biography, first novel, travel ...) and then an overall winner is chosen from those. It has the advantage of continuing through the year, with the result that the prize has a high profile. Then again, in a literary culture as restricted as ours, that might lead all the more speedily to ennui.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about an award for poetry? That literary form, once dominant, is today the most in need of succour. Would there be a sufficient number of publications to sustain such a prize?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who gets to be a judge? The character of an award can be determined by its judges, or whoever chairs the panel. Traditionally, the judges of the CNA award have come from universities, the press and from the ranks of fellow writers (often previous winners). Perhaps more members of the last group should be drawn in. Do writers make good judges of each others' work? What would the impact of an Academy-style peer system be?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And how to solve the question of language? South Africa may be committed to 11 official languages, but - as we are discovering - this system can be paralysingly cumbersome. To its credit, the M-Net Book Prize has spread its net wide, but still, of necessity, emphasises English and Afrikaans. (And there are already a few prestigious Afrikaans awards.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Literary prizes are good to have, especially when books and reading need all the glamour they can get. But prizes need to be marketed as much as a bookshop chain or any other retailer. Without a smidgeon of glitz, the award will not catch the public's imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A little controversy always helps. As Britain's Booker Prize demonstrates, a good barney between judges, journalists and public over who should get it helps sell books -books which, in the meantime, have been prominently placed in shops. Bookies even set the odds on who's most likely to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sputtering battle over last year's CNA award - one reader of this paper found it unbelievable that Zakes Mda's novel Ways of Dying didn't win - is a positive sign. When ordinary readers start taking sides, one can presume that literature in this country still has an audience which cares.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - SELECTED STORIES by Alice Munro (Chatto &amp; Windus, R110) -- ALICE MUNRO'S deeply imagined, almost awesome Selected Stories turn William Faulkner's famous musing about the past's not really being past into an understatement. In Munro's world, the present is scarcely present; the moment we live in is just a flask in which the past's vapours mingle and assert their continuing will. The past itself - the location of psychological destiny - is most often a place, the Canadian hometown or distant rural origin of a present-day narrator. Toronto, in Munro's geography, is a suburb of little towns like Dalgleish and Carstairs and West Hanratty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her stories lead back to boarding houses and farms and old department stores, into long-ago jiltings and drownings and suppressed longings that haven't stopped resonating somewhere else. &quot;Serious people - that's how I would try to describe them,&quot; says the narrator about her parents in The Progress of Love. &quot;Serious the way hardly anybody is anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a good description of both this collection's dramatis personae and the stories themselves. If Munro's basic subject matter may sometimes feel circumscribed, what she accomplishes with it, imaginatively, seems nearly limitless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these long short stories (just 28 in 545 large pages) contain a novel's worth of characters, almost all of them stood up and set running with remarkable speed. In Chaddeleys and Flemings, a narrator wonders if her mother's cousin Iris had &quot;always been like this, always brash and greedy and scared, decent, maybe even admirable ...&quot; Within a couple of pages, each adjective in the string has been dramatised and earned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An impatient reader may want to say of Munro what an exasperated creative- writing teacher remarks about the work of one of her characters: &quot;Too many things going on at the same time; also too many people. Think, he told her.  What is the important thing? What do you want us to pay attention to? Think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to Munro it's all important, and the careful reader will find it all interesting, will soon get used to the layers and byways of the author's narrative style, which works, to use one story's words about another matter, &quot; like a dream that goes back and back into other dreams, over hills and through doorways ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of these stories' mysteries never yield themselves up, but Munro's inconclusiveness is more satisfying than most writers' clarity. The barely explained malignity in Vandals - two adults' trashing of an empty house - proves as chilling as a stack of corpses would.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The frequency with which a character's personal reflections seem to apply to Munro's own subtleties testifies to her integrity of method and matter.  The whole volume makes one believe anew in fiction's power to transfigure even the bland and bleak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Material, the narrator marvels at the exactitude with which her ex- husband, a writer, has rendered in prose their hapless former housemate: Dotty &quot;was lucky to live in that basement for a few months and eventually to have this done to her, though she doesn't know what has been done and wouldn't care for it, probably, if she did know. She has passed into Art. It doesn't happen to everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suspect there are dozens of souls, from one end of Canada to the other, glimpsed by Alice Munro over the past half-century, who will never know they are equally elect. - The Washington Post</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Artist shows true colour: The revelation that an acclaimed male Aboriginal painter is really an elderly white woman has provoked outrage in Australia. Eddie Burrup's reputation has been growing for the past three years, with his work being nominated for two top awards. But this week Burrup was revealed to be 82-year-old Elizabeth Durack, a Western Australian painter of Irish descent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kay Mundeen, director of the National Indigenous Arts Advocacy Organisation, this week said laws are needed to protect Aboriginal art. &quot;It's cultural theft,&quot; she added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are rustling there: A JOHANNESBURG school, St Barnabas College, has accused the Civic Theatre in Johannesburg of racism after standard nine pupils went to watch a performance of People are Living There and members of the audience - and later the cast and administrators at the Civic - accused black St Barnabas pupils of disturbing the production by being noisy. St Barnabas says its pupils were definitely not to blame and that the closest black pupils to the noise were accused without proper investigation. The Civic says it is not racist and what was construed as an accusation was merely a follow-up to a cast inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pianist loses his Shine: DAVID HELFGOTT, the Australian child piano prodigy whose descent into madness is depicted in the Oscar-nominated film Shine, could be forgiven for feeling confused this week. On Tuesday night he made his American concert debut to a rapturous reception in Boston. The next morning he woke to the kind of reviews that have reduced more mentally stable performers to nervous wrecks. Writing in the Boston Globe, Richard Dyer complained that the performance was &quot;shapeless and utterly incoherent ...  without form, harmonic understanding, differentiation of style and basic accuracy&quot;. But the 2 000 people who managed to get a ticket to the first engagement on Helfgott's sold-out 10-city US tour gave him a protracted standing ovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missing rock star spotted in Goa: MISSING Manic Street Preachers rock star Richey Edwards is thought to be alive and well in Goa. Police are following a lead from lecturer Viv Morris, 48, who says he spotted Edwards, who vanished two years ago before a US tour, at a hippy market in the Indian resort.  Edwards, aged 27 when last seen leaving the Embassy Hotel in London in February 1995, had left his passport, credit cards and Prozac behind in his Cardiff flat. He had developed an obsession with former Mail &amp; Guardian chief photographer and Pulitzer prize-winner, Kevin Carter, who committed suicide in late 1994. One of the last songs Edwards wrote was called Kevin Carter and there was speculation that Edwards, too, had committed suicide. Said Morris last week: &quot;I truly believe it was Richey. I wouldn't want to upset his family or the band with false hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'd rather go naked and wear fur: SUPERMODEL Naomi Campbell created a storm of outrage when she opened the Fendi show in Milan this week wearing nothing but a very short suede skirt and a full-length real fur coat. Just three years ago Campbell joined other supermodels in the &quot;I'd rather go naked than wear fur&quot; campaign. But this season - and, according to pundits, even more so next season - fur is back in fashion. Other big-name models working the Fendi show - some with nothing on under their coats - included Stella Tennant and Jodie Kidd. Fendi, who recently provided the fur coats for the film Evita, later confirmed that the coats were real and included leopard, mole and rare fox fur imported fron Scandinavia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Jane Campion's been called the best female director in the world. What's female got to do with it asks LIZZIE FRANCKE finds out what inspires the film-maker</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A COUPLE of years ago, a film magazine described Jane Campion as &quot; unquestionably New Zealand's top woman director&quot;. It was meant to be a compliment. At the time the director had to her name The Piano (complete with Cannes's Palme d'Or, and three Oscars), as well as An Angel at My Table, which won the Grand Jury prize at Venice a few years before. Would the same magazine have described Tarantino, at the time of Pulp Fiction, as California's top male director?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Campion is one of the few women to leap over the barrier and join the pantheon of great film-makers. The critic David Thomson puts the record straight when he hails Campion as one of the best young directors in the world today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, her films stretch the possibilities for cinema - both in terms of visual scope and subject matter. Her first feature, the extraordinary Sweetie, was shot from a host of weird angles, as she surveyed the lives of two sisters from a family whose world was askew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dedicating it to her sister Anna, who is herself now a film-maker, she has unnervingly described it as &quot;loosely autobiographical&quot;. (One suspects this is her own playful, pre-emptive gambit in a climate that attempts to forge connections between a film-maker's work and personal history). Shot with a garish palette while at the same time affecting a drab realism, Sweetie intended to make one uncomfortable in its bittersweet depiction, particularly its sly intimation of father-daughter incest. Certainly the smart set at Cannes, where it debuted, slammed their seats in disgust, though the more discerning put the film on the map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campion's desire to find poetry in the rawness was evident in her next film, An Angel at My Table, which was unflinching in its depiction of the life of the New Zealand novelist Janet Frame who spent much of her young adulthood in a mental hospital. As with Sweetie, there was a desire to underpin uneasy family relationships, to portray a female wilfulness that had gone awry.  Campion's heroines are women at odds with the world - no more so than with the elective mute Ada in The Piano, or now The Portrait of a Lady's Isabel Archer, one of 19th-century literature's most complex heroines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This complexity is important to Campion. She has little time for traditional costume drama and has dismissed the recent rush of Jane Austen adaptations as &quot;very soft&quot;. By contrast, she says: James &quot;is very modern because he's already tearing apart the fairytale. He's saying: 'Be real. Life is hard ... No one's going to get the right person.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campion is quick to say what she doesn't like. Interviews, for example. She doesn't suffer fools - and the questions irrelevant to her work and life - gladly. She is also highly skilled at steering a conversation in her preferred direction: Henry James, George Eliot, her favourite fictional heroines Isabel and Dorothea Brooke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campion's Portrait explores the darker elements of James's text as Isabel, a seemingly bold heroine from America, makes her way through a Europe that proves to be a dangerous labyrinth in which she encounters the monstrous as personified by the aesthete Gilbert Osmond. Campion has been a fan of the novel since she was a teenager. Indeed, she seems to see something of herself in the heroine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the 20th-century Antipodean, the experience of coming to Europe has been like that of the 19th-century American. Like Isabel, Campion came to Europe as a young woman, living for a while in England and studying art in Italy. She calls it both the best and darkest time of her early life. She talks of the time she was living just outside Venice and a friend was arrested for cocaine trafficking. &quot;I had no idea that was even going on. I just thought, I'm going to be arrested and put in jail, and no one is going to listen to me.&quot; Her time in Italy, she says, helped her understand Europe's &quot;winter spirit&quot;, its darkness. It prepared her for Isabel Archer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole Kidman, who plays Isabel in Portrait, told Howard Feinstein in a perceptive piece in Vanity Fair: &quot;I think all that Isabel has experienced Jane has also experienced at some stage in her life. Isabel said that what she wants from life is chances and dangers. And I think that's also Jane.&quot; Like Isabel Archer, Campion lost a baby. Jasper died when he was 12 days old, just after Campion had won the top prize at Cannes. She says the two experiences taught her a lesson, made her reassess her life. &quot;The irony of Jasper dying at the moment of winning the Palme d'Or is that you learn that what you want is not always under your control.&quot; Portrait is dedicated to Jasper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others have suggested 42-year-old Campion is closer to another of the book's characters, the manipulative Madame Merle. But the documentary Portrait: Jane Campion and the Portrait of a Lady, made by her friends Peter Long and Kate Ellis, reveals that rather than coercing actors, she wins them round with encouragement, care, hugs a-plenty, and the occasional confrontation (ordering Shelley Winters to stop whingeing).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darkness, strangeness, madness have always been important to Campion's vision. Not so much an analysis of strangeness, just an acknowledgement that it is there, stirred in with the apparently normal, inseparable. Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that she is now planning to produce, along with husband Colin Englert (a former television reporter and director) and Nicole Kidman, Susanna Moore's violently erotic novel, In the Cut. Her mother, Edith Campion, has described Jane as idiosyncratic, a mischief-maker, &quot;with a peculiar eye on the world&quot;. She says: &quot;If Jane hadn't done anything I think she might have become a great criminal. She likes to set things into action and see what happens. But, then, that's rather like being a movie director.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One might, to be contrary, go back to that film magazine quote and ponder: is it the because Jane Campion is a woman and from the Antipodes that she has fashioned such a unique approach to film? Australia and New Zealand loom large in her films, particularly the latter, which provides the sombre psychic landscape for An Angel at My Table and The Piano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campion herself says that New Zealand fashioned her way of seeing. She points to a tiny country on the edge of the world, a country where personal matters are kept personal, a country founded on a Utopian ideal of equality that ended up flattening out difference. Campion talks of the uncelebratory nature of New Zealand. You know, she says, &quot;they used to have a programme on TV in New Zealand called That's Fairly Interesting. That's the title of it.  In America, it's That's Incredible!  New Zealand is really a country of enormous understatement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the young Campion's imagination was allowed to run riot at a time when Australian cinema was high on the new wave. She evolved as a film- maker during a particularly enlightened period in Australian film-making. In the late 1970s and early 1980s government-funded agencies actively encouraged young women film- makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From her early shorts, Campion took a very particular, uncensored slant on what she observed, never shying of the stranger or abject elements of life.  In A Girl's Own Story, a 1960s-set coming-of-age short, pubescent desires turn dangerous as a brother and sister experiment with each other. When she made her first featurette, Two Friends, for Australian TV, Campion turned story-telling inside out as she ran back to front the tale of two schoolmates who fall out, with the film starting at the final bust-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her pursuit of new ways of seeing things is no less evident than with her version of James's The Portrait of a Lady, her first film to be shot in Europe. I say version, since this film spikes expectations of the literary adaptation genre. Campion's movie is like an intense, intimate reading that explores the darker elements of James's text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I love about James is that he plots a life in terms of the spiritual journey as much as anything else,&quot; explains Campion. &quot;Isabel Archer starts out on a false journey - in the pursuit of worldly knowledge, and she can't even imagine what it is she wants to be knowing and learning. What she does find out is who she is.&quot; Campion identifies closely with Isabel's journey. &quot;I really love Europe. But I tried to live in England and got very depressed. I began to wonder whether it was something to do with my relationship with the sky. One can have a very psychic relationship with the sky.&quot; In this, she says, she is very much an island girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, one thinks of her as wild to nature, and fearless. She strips through the heavy undergrowth of emotions, uprooting the primal even in the poised milieu of James's novel. In Portrait, drawing-rooms become bloody battlegrounds. Once again, Campion has reshaped our perception of the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Don't you just hate the fact that there aren't any magazines on the market that focus on dance music and South African techno/hip- hop/kwaito culture? It's definitely not cool to have to page through (the very expensive) The Face, Vibe or whatever's available at your local bookstore to find info on the club and fashion scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, for that matter, don't you just hate the fact that no local magazines are willing to take a truly cutting edge approach to their layout and design?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, never fear, there has been a minor revolution on this front thanks to The House Natives Project and their zooty new mag Circut. They've just released the second issue of the first South African magazine covering all of the above with a professional attitude and underground mentality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Natives are a design company specialising in rave flyers, posters and promotional material for DJs - a glamorous, stylish scene where, as one of the magazine's editors, Inayet Motara, says, &quot;The quality of image became most important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Circut comes in a square format (20cm by 20cm) - a style that is relatively unique to the local market. The pages range from clean to really design- intensive. House Natives have tried to capture the current over-designed, busy trend with pages that are also readable, and for my five bucks' worth, it works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Circut costs R5 and is available at selected record stores. Call House Natives at (011) 728-4056 or e-mail them at hnp@iafrica.com</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - DAVID BOWIE has spent the last seven or eight years trying to claw back the credibility he squandered in the Eighties - the &quot;normal years&quot; when he cleaned up and copped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His hard-rock band Tin Machine made often ugly music, and his first shot at a comeback, Black Tie White Noise,was barely convincing. But it sowed the seeds of what has reached full flower in his new album, Earthling (BMG).  Bowie had begun to dabble, in his magpie fashion, with the new dance music.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bowie's admiration for the king of trip- hop, Tricky, was apparent on his last album, Outside, but its best tracks were the up-tempo ones. Earthling is more Goldie than Tricky, continuing where such songs as Hello Spaceboy left off. It is a fast, sometimes nerve-rattling collection, a fruitful collision between (post-)dance grooves and basic loud-guitar rock'n'roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bowie's eclectism works here as it did not on the last couple of albums: this time, the graft has taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His vocals are submerged in the mix, and the sonic palette is dense and scratchy, but all is ruled by the driving beat. The whole album has a straightforward quality that has often been lacking in Bowie's mania for grand statements and hidden by his vaulting artistic ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What, asked one critic recently, is Bowie without his pretensions? For one thing, it appears, he can be a damn fine musician, one prepared to make an album like Earthling, which sounds nothing like anything he has made before, possibly his most innovative album in two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Bowie's thunder, however, seems to have been stolen by U2, whose new album, Pop (Island), was initially hyped overseas as a new departure into dance and trip-hop. Yet it is not nearly as thorough-going as Earthling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is the percolating Discoth que and a couple of Tricky Lite numbers, and it is all decorated with twittering electronica, but overall this is a pretty characteristic U2 album - the quota of Jesus/God invocation even seems to have gone up to pre-McPhisto levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's nothing on Pop that would have been out of place on Achtung Baby or Zooropa: in fact, it could be the third work in a trilogy. Pop is a very fine album, but I don't think it is a &quot;mature masterpiece&quot; or the band's best work, as it has been hailed. It may even mark the playing out of the group's second creative wave, the U2 Mach II reinvention that came after the blow-out of Rattle and Hum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Would this year's Bandslam follow the triumphs of last year?  MALU VAN LEEUWEN was at the River Club concert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APOLOGISTS for the so-called South African Music Explosion are probably going to hate me for this, but it's so corny it's worthy of a Leon Shuster gag - except the man has more taste than to stage a bomb scare at a Soundzone Bandslam. &quot;SA Music Explosion Explodes!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could see the headline as a friend forcibly escorted me from Cape Town's River Club building by the scruff of my fake fur collar. Slightly more glamorous was Just Jinger's exit as they stopped mid- performance to instruct the audience to vacate the premises in a calm, orderly manner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the mild panic subsided, all that remained was the cruel irony: after weeks of speculation about the launch of the new Bandslam - would it match up to last year's rockfest? - Gauteng's Just Jinger had managed to ignite an otherwise bemused crowd into showing some loud, appreciative enthusiasm for local music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were headlining and they were the only band that notoriously hard-to- please Capetonians had not been exposed to live. It was a calculated risk on the part of Soundzone, Bandslam's organisers, to feature unknowns whose only claim to fame was a single receiving airplay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody knows who the nutter was who phoned in with the threat or why, but he or she is unofficially assumed to have come from the group who threw golf balls against cars, presumably disgruntled after a scuffle with security guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the case, it's unnecessary bad publicity - the kind that South African music can definitely do without - and I hope they remember this the next time they decide to dent a few cars and play the fool with the public's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the speculation, it was always going to be a hard act to follow 1996's national roadshow featuring names like Squeal, Lithium, Sugardrive, Nine and the Springbok Nude Girls. It was an established cast and, although vulnerable to the kind of criticism that trades on the white male rock clich' (was coloured band Nine a token act?), it was a deserved success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging from the response of the 1 200- strong crowd last Saturday night, success can't always be measured by how much the front rows scream and go mal.  Rather, it's how much people talk about the event afterwards, how impatiently they anticipate the confirmed line-up for the national tour later in the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a lot to talk about. Guided by their belief that current music trends and tastes are towards lighter, more diverse acts with a feel for entertaining, Soundzone chose Sons of Trout from Cape Town (oddly, with belly- dancers in tow), Famous Curtain Trick from Durban, Dorp from Stellenbosch and Just Jinger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sons of Trout are relatively new and their vibrant Waterboys-cum-Streaks- inflected electric folk-pop is distinctly Obs in flavour. They're good to the point where it's tempting to call them the new, less intense Urban Creep.  Unfortunately, that early Creeps sound has since dated and paled in popularity. Yet theirs is a sound that's been around in one way or another for as long as I can remember. On the other hand, how it will translate into national appeal is anybody's guess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next band up, Famous Curtain Trick, is something of a conundrum and they've been castigated to Bellville and back for importing bluesy country and western that would be more at home in Kentucky than Kaapstad. Meanwhile, the same critics forget that the South African rock sound owes more to Seattle grunge than it does to any &quot;homegrown&quot; genre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The music, however, is not FCT's problem: the real problem is their performance, or lack of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadine Raal is a born lead singer with a voice that's simultaneously honey and gravel. If only she'd get her band to lose the miserabilism and interact more with her and the audience. For instance, when Raal leaves her guitar on Cheap Perfume to prowl the stage, the connection is instant and spontaneous; with her guitar slung back on again, it as if they're all going through the motions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to performance, Dorp have got it waxed. At the risk of repeating myself - and further pissing off the apologists - Dorp are South Africa's answer to The Spin Doctors. (Phew, said it.) But let me explain: they're wacky, way-out, jazzy, rocky, funky - and all this came packaged in a safari suit that bounced around the stage in an unstoppable mini-orgy of energy. When the safari suit whipped out his cellphone to have a conversation with the saxophonist, the crowd all but demanded autographs right there and then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it's nothing like using the telephone as a weapon as per Bono's Zooropa conversations with God/ Alessandra Mussolini/fill in the missing name, it's an entertainment spectacle - and undoubtedly what Soundzone is looking for. Bingo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally: Just Jinger. After an impressively noisy start they dipped into the radio single (the love ballad that aches &quot;I'm going to stand/ stand in your way ...&quot;), at which point I wondered out loud to a friend whether Bryan Adams was in the house, and if so, is this what I'd given up an academic career for. No, came the smart reply, this is what a truncated academic career trained me for. The bastard's right, of course: no thesis could explain how Just Jinger pulled off it off and seduced Capetonians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the speculation is on who will be in the final Bandslam line-up and while this one fared well it is going to need that je ne sais quoi - like the throbbing gutsiness of Battery Nine's body music - to really send it to Mars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The X-FILES has been a huge international hit since it launched in the US three years ago, and it has just won three Golden Globe awards. Now its creator, Chris Carter, has taken an even bigger risk with his new series, Millennium. In Britain, Alan Yentob, director of programmes at BBC-TV, asks Carter about the United States's millennial fears of chaos and violence as reflected in this new series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Yentob: Chris, you started off first as a surfer, then as editor of a surfing magazine. I've allied this to one of your quotes: &quot;I'm a non- religious person looking for a religious experience&quot; - is that what surfing and The X-Files have in common: looking for a religious experience?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Carter: I think The X-Files is looking for meaning and looking for what is, for me, tantamount to a religious experience - a paranormal experience. I was raised a Baptist - I'm a lapsed religious person, though I'd like to find something that tested my beliefs, tested my faith.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did you get from editing a surf magazine to The X-Files?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a very illogical and sort of a kookie career. I worked for the surfing magazine because I love to surf and it was a way to postpone entering adulthood. I also learned to sit my butt on a chair and put my fingers on a keyboard and write a lot of words. But I got to be where I am because I met the woman who is now my wife, who has been a screenwriter for probably twice as long as I have. I told her a story - and she encouraged me to write it.  Nothing ever happened with it, but it got me a lot of attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then you went to work for Disney?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, and that got me into the business. I wrote what everyone wanted me to.  I learned my craft and I finally got a chance with The X-Files to do something that I'd been wanting to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was it accepted at the first pitch?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, they didn't know what it was and it was turned down at first. But I was so certain that it was a good idea, as was the man who's now the president of 20th Century Television. They wanted to be in business with me; they bought the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were there any antecedents?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I grew up on shows like The Twilight Zone. The Avengers was a love of mine and I see its influence in the Mulder- Scully relationship. The show that was most inspirational and The X-Files is homage to it, is The Night Stalker, where a newspaper reporter would find these strange things - vampires, ghosties, ghouls, beasties and goblins and come back and try to tell people about them, and they wouldn't believe him. It lasted only 18 episodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulder and Scully are essentially opposites: one is sceptical, the other is a believer. I get the impression that you see yourself as a sceptic but wanting the best of both worlds. You say - but I want to believe. And you see the desire in other people to believe the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's in all of us. Even the hardened atheist. There's some degree of hope in all of us that our faith can be tested, that we'll see something that shakes us and moves us and lets us believe there's something beyond the temporal and the mundane and the facts that we're going to live and die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poster reads: &quot;I want to believe&quot;. You do too, but then you remember the rule - trust no one. There is that sense of distrust with institutions, with governments. Was that fundamental, that Mulder and Scully would be subversives, although they were in government employ? Mulder is the believer.  Do you think that's part of a tradition - like the errant cop - or is this new?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a very personal feeling of mine and if it is particular to the moment, maybe I'm feeling what a lot of people are feeling. If there is a subversive quality, it comes out of my distrust of authority. So that feeling, and phrases like &quot;trust no one&quot;, &quot;deny everything&quot; and &quot;apology is policy&quot; - that is the way governments act. I think those are the political messages sneaking in there. It's fun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TV people here have seen the pilot edition of Millennium. In terms of what you believe television is there to do - to entertain - this is altogether a darker, blacker piece of television than anything you've done.  What made you feel you wanted to do it, and that there would be an appetite for a show like Millennium?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are movies that I liked very much, like Silence of the Lambs and Seven, that I thought captured a mood and a colour that appealed to me and my sense of story- telling. So I was not trying to do anything that hadn't been done before, with subject matter that hadn't been approached before. I thought what movies that had taken on this subject matter lacked is this bright centre, this reason to go out and do something heroic, which is uncommon, at least in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence here is a big issue for me. I think America has become a dangerous place, particularly for women. So I wanted to create a very bright hero and I could only create him by setting him against a very dark background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But is it then a moral tale, about good and evil in a way that The X-Files isn't?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I think it is. I've created an idealised family situation; a husband and a wife who both live with the knowledge that the world is a dark place.  She is clinical social worker - so she'll be dealing with problems. He isn't a psychic: but he's developed an ability to think like the killer thinks.  He's able to imagine what a killer might be thinking. I think of them as working at the same types of problems and people. She is able to affect people before they become the kind of person he would hunt down to prevent killing again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series is called Millennium - there is a sense that we are moving into the third millennium, a sense of conspiracy theories, something rather sinister and evil. Is that thread, not yet a political thread but a social thread - going to weave its way through the series?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Definitely. It's what this series is all about: the collapse of things, the chaos, the randomness, the uncertainty. These are all big, big ideas that we live with every day and we live in denial of them. I am going to put it in people's faces. The idea is there may be some truth or connection to prophecy - biblical or other - motivating criminals to behave the way they do. The connections are loose, but we are on a downhill slide rather than an uphill one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's very strong meat - it's not the kind of material that easily finds its way on to the networks. You have to convince the networks and the regulators - the standards and practices. Do you feel any constraints about what you can or can't do on network television today?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am constrained, although I don't feel the constraints are a problem. I'm not interested in pushing the limits of graphic violence. On The X-Files, we've done a good job of showing the results of violence, but not the violence itself, or the impending doom. I think that we're all used to seeing gory movies, it's had a dulling effect. Good storytellers are figuring out a way not to show these things. What I am concerned about is content, because I think that the climate of American television right now is very anti-reality - people want much lighter and more palatable fare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's a big ambition, one that you think can be accommodated both by the watchdogs in America and by the networks who want ratings. Have you tested this show?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes. It tested very well, there was a very high percentage of people who said they would love to see it again or see the series. And I believe that it is because of the heroic quality of it: they weren't looking to be titillated or just scared. The series - we're shooting the fourth episode currently - seems to be on track too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're telling good, scary stories about the breakdown of things, the lack of justice in America - people taking justice into their own hands - and a lot of the forces out there that are causing people to go on crime sprees, random acts of violence. As we head towards 2000, I think that it is just natural - that the world we live in and this date that is looming give the series a shape and certainty a destination that I hope will be interesting to explore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I gather that you got five years more of the The X-Files. So you're not worried about crossing Millennium with that one?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll see. I'm dedicated to it, I want to do five great years of The X- Files - anything beyond that will be gravy ... With the new series it's very hard. I took it on, not because I need to see if I can do it again, but as the countdown was ticking to 2000, I thought I could do this series now or never.You get a chance once every 1 000 years, I figured I'd better take it or someone else would.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The first second of the year 2000 will see your personal history vanish forever. At least as far as your bank, government and insurance company are concerned. And perhaps it is typical that these bureaucracies do not seem disturbed at this prospect.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 80% of the computers controlling the obvious and invisible digital transactions around you are currently unable to process information generated in the year 2000. The root of the fault lies in the dd/mm/yy (day/month/year) format used by computing systems to keep track of the passage of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using only two digits to represent the year on your computer's time-keeping devices would result in 1999 (displayed as &quot;99&quot; on your computer) to revert back to &quot;00&quot; as this clock ticks over, effectively sending it backwards in time to the year 1900.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To understand the scale of the resulting chaos, try to digest this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Computer hardware and software are likely to be carrying this inherent fault. Of course, each set of hardware may use several different pieces of software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Each record resulting from a transaction may be passed between several different computers and processed by several different pieces of software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Often these computers are located at different institutions, sometimes in different parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Any single piece of hardware or software handling this data could corrupt it and render it completely inaccessible, or worse, inaccurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now multiply these records and daily data transactions by the computer network systems used by banks, government departments, stock exchanges, retailers, the military, agriculture and food production, power and energy, telecommunications, medical and scientific institutions, stockbrokers and insurance companies worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse news is that the computer industry, notorious for its ability to adapt and &quot;patch&quot; its way into the future, is at a loss how to correct this situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Methodically upgrading and rewriting thousands of software applications, replacing millions of computer components and extensively testing new systems is a process that would have to begin immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the reason that many companies have chosen to ignore this crisis is the price tag - $50-million to $100-million for each of the Fortune 50 organisations - though experts predict that the legal consequences could run into trillions of dollars and the closure of up to 20% of US companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the brightest prospect you might hold out for is to stop having to make those payments on your car.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As we speed towards the new millennium, popular culture is being invaded by psychoses, conspiracies, warnings of digital chaos - and little grey creatures. In our heads and on our TV screens we are watching the invasion. Believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GREYISH skin, elongated oval head and huge wraparound eyes. It's an image that heralds the end of the millennium. New technology, improved medicine, global unity. It peeps at us from the cover of popular novels, it gazes unflinchingly off a mallrat's shirt, it stares out from the television screen.  Greyish skin, elongated oval head and huge wraparound eyes. It's an image which resonates to an ancient submerged horror. Our nightmares are back to haunt us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It sells tickets at the box-office; it flogs shirts at chainstores; it screeches over an ambient track by The Orb. Accept that the real image of extraterrestrials, the &quot;grey&quot; as it's known by Ufologists, is slyly slipping into our collective subconscious. It's slowly replacing the peace sign as the cultural icon of our times.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It started 50 years ago, on June 24 1947. It didn't really, depending on who you ask, but that's where I'd like it to start. On June 24 1947 Kenneth Arnold was flying a routine mission for the United States airforce when he saw a formation of nine brightly lit objects skimming through the air. When he landed he told the press that the objects skimmed like a spinning saucer would over a pond. Flying saucers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Black. Out. Cold. I'm on my back. There's a light above me. My eyes won't focus. Pain everywhere. Pain in my head. Pain in my chest. Rustling. I can hear movement in the dark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's 50 years later now, and 15 million Americans claim to have been abducted by aliens. There are support groups, dozens of books, countless magazine articles, photographs, films, societies, artists, hoaxes and myths.  Believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's 50 years later now and if the governments of the world are investigating alien phenomena they are keeping quiet about it. The heroes of Ufology today are people like James Mulder from the X-Files, The Orb and various researchers with multi- million book deals, out to punt their latest novel. There is a growing body of theories, tales of abductions, unproven stories. Put that all together and what you have is either an alien invasion, cultural psychosis or a compelling new myth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I open my eyes. There are these creatures all around me. I scream. They're short, maybe five feet, large heads, enormous brown eyes ... man, those eyes, they just stared right through me. No eyelashes, no eyebrows, just these two big brown eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 1 028 days left and the UFO myth is emerging as one of the most potent quasi-religions for the new millennium. Like any good religion, Ufology's messengers of peace, hope and a visionary tomorrow are being persecuted and conspiracy theories abound as to exactly what information is being kept hidden from the faithful. Is the government experimenting on humans with alien DNA? Are they hiding some secret message from the aliens?  Is the X-Files a plot by aliens to prepare humanity for their arrival? Trust no one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I scream, I jump up. This thing falls off my chest. A thick plastic strap.  It hits the floor and rocks back and forth. A light comes on from beneath it, but there aren't any wires or tubes in it. 'Get away from me! Who are you?  What's going on here?' I'm hysterical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ufology is not the sole province of techno- anarchists, conspiracy fetishists or TV junkies. As society begins its countdown, the edge becomes the mainstream and more conservatives theorists move in, redefining our notions of where society is going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mainstreaming of &quot;the invasion&quot; can be seen in the myriad articles published about sightings and abductions. In T-shirts bearing &quot;the grey&quot; and the word &quot;believe&quot;. In mainstream television like the X-Files, where Scully and Mulder track down various alien cover-ups. But this is more than just pre- millennium paranoia and the stories that form the basis of this hit series are taken from actual accounts and documentation of the unexplained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hot. The room is really hot. The air is heavy. Heavy and wet. I can hardly breathe. My mind raging. I feel like I've been burned. Inside and out. I ache like I've been crushed or something. It hurts. We go down a hallway. Through some empty space. The air is cooler, fresher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Low legato flames of this culture are springing up all over; minimalist solos that result in aliens becoming more accepted; conspiracy theories that mark this mindset as this generation's answer to the world they have inherited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if every action has an equal and opposite reaction, than every conspiracy theory has a scientific explanation. Psychologist Michael Persinger explains UFO phenomena as rogue electrical currents in the earth that stimulate a leakage from left to right hemisphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dreams and illusions are shifting into the conscious mind. Reality. The reason we all see the same little grey men, the same pattern of abduction repeating itself, is not because we are being kidnapped by aliens, but because the same area of our brain is being stimulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, hang on a second. I'm hysterical. They're putting me down on a table.  They smile. Like I was misbehaving or something. They're putting a mask on my face. I reach up to pull it off. Black. Out. Cold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, of course, no end to the number of sceptics either. John Menzies of the Sutherland observatory in the Karoo, has certainly seen his fair share of &quot;odd things&quot;. He attributes them to NASA rockets, satellites being moved or various natural phenomena. &quot;Two or more moving lights are almost certainly an airplane ... The strangest thing I've seen is a light that moved fairly slowly then speeded up. But I'm pretty convinced that what I saw was the tail end of a rocket ... There hasn't been any concrete evidence for the existence of UFOs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what would be accepted as concrete evidence? Photographic evidence?  Faked. Films? Faked. Alien autopsies? Faked. Repeating patterns in anomalous experiences? Brain stimulation. Abductees relating their experience under hypnosis? Hallucinations. What about implants removed from abductees? It's hard to pin down what the scientific community would accept as evidence for alien abductions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm cold and awake in a phone booth at a gas station. My brother is on his way to pick me up. Those eyes haunt me. I can't get them out of my head. Big.  Glassy. No white, just brown. Like shades on a window.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this makes for some very inconclusive science but some very wicked art. One group of artists delves deep into alien mythology, based in the urban sprawl of Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High Frequency Audio Auroral Research Programme (HFAARP) makes performance art for viewing through a radioactive suit, performances that gurgle like a chainsaw going through an alien skullcase and vibrate to an otherworldly beat. HFAARP sets up alien scenarios, sound sculptures based in alien folklore, pulling peoples legs, counting the faithful, forcing a gap in reality. Believe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the dark aesthetic of an alien nation, stitched together from the various conspiracy theories, abductions, sightings. Much of its mindset and many of its timbres are taken from pop culture and literature rather than scientific evidence. Freed from the need to explain, artists use alien culture to explore contradictions ... the future now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been worried about you.&quot; &quot;But it's only been a couple of hours?&quot; &quot; Feel your face.&quot; &quot;I have a real heavy growth of beard.&quot; &quot;You've been gone for five days!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what does it mean? Why the buzz about UFOs, crop circles, alien abductions and strange phenomena? Are we really being invaded? Does it really matter? Maybe, but it's not about contact with aliens, it's about contact with a new open-ended belief system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's about creating gaps in reality; it's about preparing ourselves for a new millennium and facing up to a brave new world. Aliens may be out there - we'd be silly to think that out of the whole universe we were the only living creatures. The only thing more shocking than finding out that there are aliens out there would be to find out that there aren't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My name is Trevor, or just Trev. There are 1028 days left and I still don't know what I want from life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Why did they call it the Dance Umbrella? For two weeks now, there's been a gentle but persistent rain over the city of Johannesburg, adding its own peculiar drumming to the rhythms of dance at the Wits Theatre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grey downpour outside the Braamfontein building drew a motley crew indoors to share the sheltered space that dancers and choreographers seem to live in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On opening night the Moving into Dance Too company flourished in the meta- rain. In Pula-Mvula three agile dancers tap-danced in makeshift plastic raincoats, clutching a large umbrella, to the cheerful refrains of Singing in the Rain. It was a tongue-in- cheek celebration of the occasion, and a spirited experiment in uniting dance and theatrical space.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the whole, though, the tone of the evening was sombre. As one dance piece replaced the next, it became clear this shelter is a temporary therapist's couch for the current obsessions of the South African psyche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporate Cacophony (discord in the office), choreographed by Christopher Kindo and Denise Stephani, chafed at a raw nerve for many people. It was a ruthless look at the network of anger, resentment and fear that makes up a new South African workplace, where race and gender struggles lead to ever- tightening spirals of destructiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strong tone of cynicism was prevalent throughout all three programmes that I've seen. Arthur Pita and Clair Breton's carefully orchestrated piece, Momentarily, was dripping in sarcasm. He danced earnestly in a little blue frock, and she sat in the audience talking at the top of her voice into her cellphone, about isolation, boredom and loneliness. Her voice wove sentences around his movements, making for very effective theatre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also saw many vehement protest dances. They were making statements of social consciousness against the injustices of the past, and the reflections in the present. Some of them were a literal translation of the testimony of amnesty applications into the language of dance, or a litany of the agonies of poverty and welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though these pieces often showed inevitably mediocre dancing, I think they are important parts of the therapy process that the arts in South Africa are apparently going through. That didn't stop me from being bored though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the statements that did work, perhaps because they were metaphorical and open to more interpretations, were Jeanette Ginslov's Severance, and Timothy Bellew's Hi!, which was a strong antithetical power play between lust and Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Themes of violence were visible everywhere, echoing the fears that everyone feels - some have called it a pre-millennium paranoia. Violence against women, rape and prostitution, apartheid-era violence, misunderstandings and nameless rage - all of these were very visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Morris as the Untouchable, used visual puns to punch home how comfortable we all are with the imagery of violence, masochism, crime and murder. Ironically, this only occurred to me in retrospect. During the performance, the audience was laughing hard right the way through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, there were a number of pieces depicting havens of safety in a wistful counter-reaction. Sarah Tudge's Chasing the Dragon, and Grayham Davies's Somewhere, both explore the search for an idyllic world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in his performance, Charlie Jeffries has found it. He hangs suspended just above the stage in a gorgeous simulation of a womb, blissfully representing one of the safest places in the world - a Womb Limbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diek Grobler offered a rather less successful attempt at minimalism with Music Box Dance - &quot;a comment on the nature of art through the medium of dance&quot; . A giant projection of a plastic music box ballerina spinning through her limited oeuvre was fascinating to watch, but quickly became inane and wasn't exciting enough to arrest an audience so tuned in to television culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many dance companies put on characteristic traditional or cultural pieces, of Indian, Spanish or Zulu dance. Like soap bubbles that reflect a rainbow, these pieces were spectacular to watch, and non-threatening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Braver choreographers have tried to synthesize various styles, and often these attempts are unsuccessful or bland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone, however, was wowed by the rhythmic masterpiece,Talas in Conversation, by Jayesperi Moopen, with dancers from Tribhangi Dance Theatre and Moving into Dance Too, sharing the stage with drummers on Indian tablas and a large African drum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For me, the performances most interesting to watch were those in which the dancers' relationships with their physical or metaphysical props serve to create some kind of magic: the ropes that hold Tracey Human's dancers off the ground and the leaves Denise Stephani dances on in Dust, Robyn Orlin's swinging naked light bulbs, and the inflatable world on a weary shoulder - all integral communication tools in the procession of dance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Umbrella stays up for another week, and I look forward to feasting some more on the glut of enthusiasm and energy it shelters, before we'll be turned out into the rain again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - GWEN ANSELL talks to a new generation of jazz composers involved in Our Music Our Voices at the breakthrough 1997 Windybrow Arts Festival</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN a tiny, sweaty rehearsal room at the Windybrow Theatre an improbably large band of musicians pounds its way through McCoy Mrubata's Sangoma Blues.  In the middle, in the few square feet between keyboards, drums and trumpet, a breakdancer finds just enough space to do the splits.Forty-eight hours before opening and the cast of Our Music, Our Voices is polishing final arrangements and staging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our Music Our Voices is an idea the Windybrow Festival took to four composers; reedman Mrubata, trumpeter Prince Lengoasa, guitarist Bheki Khoza and singer Suthukazi Arosi. Says director Walter Chakela: &quot;We felt there wasn't enough focus on the jazz composers of the post-exile generation. They tend to be showcased just as musicians, when in fact they're fine composers whose work is fresh and at the same time deeply informed by the legacy of their predecessors.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's more. Talking to the four about their compositions (the programme includes five from each) is a conversation with a sharply contemporary edge, about what's happening to culture in the &quot;New South African what-what&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lengoasa sums it up: &quot;We have to reflect on where we've come from to know where we're going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The orchestration, the chords of Prince's songs,&quot; says Mrubata, &quot;the movement of the harmonies all have a real spiritual feel. They remind me of when I was a kid - I was an altar boy at the church of the Order of Ethiopia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The others are surprised by this memory and it carries the discussion off on a spiritual track. For Arosi, &quot;It's time to use music to teach the youth about who we are as human beings, so that our identity isn't lost in multiculturalism.&quot; Mrubata agrees: &quot;My kids go to an English-language creche and I love the way their English is developing - but at home 80% of the time we speak Xhosa because I don't want them to go too far away from their culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Khoza, those cultural roots are one of the strengths of Arosi's songs: &quot; There's an appealing modern beat, but the singing over the top keeps the influence of the traditionalists.&quot; And for him, too, that's an important combination. &quot;It's hard to explain, but everything else in my music is built on a foundation of Zulu guitar. I learnt so early that I can't even pinpoint when, or when I started thinking about myself as a musician. It was just natural. When I started playing pop chords, my grandmother would be there, questioning, telling me 'that thing doesn't answer: play it this way.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he'll feature a few straightahead numbers, Khoza's set will focus on songs rather than instrumentals, a side of the guitarist that's less well- known. &quot;They're songs,&quot; says Lengoasa, &quot;very much about what's happening now - for example, there's one about how drugs are damaging the music scene, disabling even some well-known players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a concern for everyone round the table; the cocaine epidemic, they say, is starting to claim serious victims, and Mrubata, too, has an anti-drug lyric in his set. He'll also be showcasing material from his upcoming album; out in mid-year and titled Tears of Joy - &quot;for the emotions of at last being able to record what I like&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Round the table it's agreed Mrubata's music represents a special kind of South African fusion &quot;somewhere between marabi and The Crusaders&quot;. Now there are new elements as well, like the song Fula (co-written with bassist Andre Abrahamse) which incorporates West African beats to reflect what Mrubata calls &quot;the new atmosphere of urbanisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's that heady new scent of the city - drugs, cultural and spiritual questing, the jostling of old and new and a melting-pot of languages and rhythms - which not just Our Music, Our Voices but the whole Windybrow Festival has caught this year. As Lengoasa says: &quot;We might make you get up and jive. Or we might send you away rethinking your whole life. Or both.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - LESLEY MARX revisits The Space theatre and some of its stalwarts and memories in time for the 25th anniversary celebrations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARTHUR BENJAMIN has a huge warm wicked generous laugh. It erupts as he tries to explain why Brian Astbury was, for him, an inspirational figure at The Space Theatre: &quot;He got you to do things for nothing; he got you to go and beg for the theatre; he got you to share his vision; you could do theatre out of nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The words take on a special poignancy as I listen to him in the sparsely furnished dining room of the St Francis Home in Athlone, Cape Town. Still filled with the vision imparted by his years at The Space, Benjamin is now vice principal of the home, trying to give hope to 65 abused and abandoned children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a way, his life has the symmetry of a well-made play. His first theatre performance at The Space was as narrator for a children's piece, The Incredible Jungle Journey of Fenda Maria. While performing in this play, he stage managed both it and the Barney Simon production of Medea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doubling-up of roles was typical of The Space. Brian Astbury's memoir reiterates how, from its beginnings in March 1972, stars, cleaners and management would join in to paint and patch, sell tickets, raise funds, run the box office. Benjamin remembers being given lessons by Yvonne Bryceland, Michelle Maxwell, Jacqui Singer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspired by the Open Space in Tottenham Court Road, London, with its spare simplicity, Astbury came back to Cape Town and found enough support - moral, financial and artistic - to open in Bloem Street with Athol Fugard's Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act, specially written for the occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are incredible stories of finding replacement actors and directors at the 11th hour. At least twice, the long- suffering Pieter-Dirk Uys came to the rescue. He was given five days to prepare for Skyvers/Jollers, after Robin Malan had to leave, and two weeks to complete the direction of We Bombed in New Haven, after Mavis Taylor fell ill. But then, The Space also offered Uys the opportunity to stage his own remarkable early work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Faces in the Wall, he was compared to John Osborne. Selle ou Storie brought him together with Christine Basson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other young talents were also given their chance at The Space: Bill Curry, for example, was able to come in from apartheid's cold world and turn professional. Benjamin speaks of the tensions that the broader social and political context of the theatre could and did generate: &quot;In no way could you keep out reality. You brought your country in with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there was the fine talent of two women playwrights: Geraldine Aron and Fatima Dike. Aron's Bar and Ger lay unread for months, because Astbury thought it looked as thick as War and Peace. In fact she had typed a verse per page and, after he'd read it, there was no doubt that a subtle and delicate new voice was going to be heard. Dike, affectionately known as Fatts, won Best New Play award for The Sacrifice of Kreli after it travelled up to Barney Simon and the Market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Fugard and Bryceland are inextricably linked with the history of The Space. From its founding moment, Fugard's savage funny painful redemptive confrontations with his country stamped the new theatre and the decade with the mark of courage and the refusal of silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The play's stars, John Kani and Winston Ntshona, resigned from their regular jobs and used The Space from then on as a base from which to launch professional careers. Arthur Benjamin's own story testifies to the power of The Space to change lives. A soil tester with a civil engineering company, he was given a scholarship to study civil engineering at UCT. He chose, instead, to resign and work full-time for the Space. The happy ending is that he later won a British Council scholarship and completed his theatre studies in Cardiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the mid-Seventies financial stress forced Astbury and company to move to the YMCA building in Long Street. They closed the old theatre with William Tanner's Tsafendas and got the audience to take their chairs around the corner to the new theatre. The story has become part of Space lore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening of the new venue was celebrated with Dimitri Nicolas- Fanourakis's production of Beckett's Endgame. One of the notable features of Space history is the imaginative mix of the famous, the notorious, the established, the new, the safe and the avant-garde. So plays by Wesker, O'Neill, Labiche, Chekhov, Orton, Williams, Genet, Woody Allen, Griffiths, Shepard, Fassbinder and Rabe all appeared at one time or another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Uys made a hoe-down success (with four weeks to rehearse) of John Ford's Jacobean revenge tragedy 'Tis Pity She's a Whore. Then there were the Spanish dance programmes with Hazel Acosta and Pablo Navarro, and the tragic talent of Gary Burne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arthur Benjamin feels that this mix was one of the major reasons for The Space surviving as long as it did. Even the advent of television in 1976 and the craze for Rich Man, Poor Man every Tuesday night was no match for imaginative planning. Libby Morris simply staged her memoir of Piaf, Je Vous Aime, at 6 'o clock and packed the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If all there was to The Space was fond memories, a 25-year celebration would be simply a charming exercise in nostalgia. Benjamin tells of the pleasure of getting together to talk about the commemorative programme with Fatima Dike, Dorrian McLaren and Rob Amato.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real testimony to The Space lies in Benjamin's own life and that of others like him. Accepting Astbury's offer of R40 a week to be a general factotum, he ended his career at the Space as one of its finest stage managers. The final paragraph of acknowledgments that closes Astbury's memoir is devoted to Arthur: &quot;He became part of the show ...&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Arthur the show continued into his Cardiff studies and his return to South Africa where he became a children's drama teacher. He took his vision to retarded and deprived children. When he was appointed drama teacher to high-IQ children at the prestigious Groote Schuur Hoerskool, he saw process rather than product as the key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For him, the wonder of it all lay in the process of teaching children to see different points of view. His own capacity for keeping many perspectives in view is the double life he led for many years: working full time at St Francis Home, but taking one afternoon a week off to teach the Groote Schuur children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A host of special events and productions have been arranged to commemorate the anniversary of The Space. See back page for details</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The drama division at the Cape Association Performing Arts Board (Capab) will be closed down for good at the end of March, a well-placed source at the arts structure has revealed. The decision was apparently taken due to the board's lack of funds. It signals the end of the staging of plays from within Capab's base, the Nico Malan Theatre, and the death of its schools and education programmes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resident actors, who will now be out of work, claim to have received abysmal package offers as compensation while administrative staff say they have been offered nothing at all, even after years of service. And all members of Capab Drama have further been instructed by the board not to approach the press with these complaints. &quot;As it stands now, they're basically telling us to piss off without a deal,&quot; says the source, adding that rumours have repeatedly circulated that former head of Capab, George Loopuyt, received a massive settlement when he left Capab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Dreyer, a veteran actress, has been performing with Capab Drama on and off for 25 years, and been under full contract for 10 years. &quot;We were promised the best deal possible,&quot; she says, &quot;and they settled for one week's pay per year of service, the lowest possible settlement in terms of the Labour Relations Act. We stood by Capab through all ... When it was run by the Broederbond, the shows were banned and heavily censored. And then we fought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, when we thought we won through that lot, we were decapitated by the new dispensation that we fought for. I agree the Nico must be opened up, but they're getting rid of the wrong people. The people who are left can run the building, sure, but the building doesn't mean anything without the art ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marthinus Basson, resident artistic director, says that every person at Capab is underpaid. &quot;The government is not treating actors with respect, and never has,&quot; he says, adding that actors are being abused and exploited: &quot;They love the job and are desperate. Veterans in their 60s are seldom being paid more than R1 400 a month ... Universities are churning out talented individuals for a profession that no longer exists. We need a company system for theatre to survive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Maas, chief executive of Capab, blames the government: &quot;There was a decision in September last year that all chorus members and drama actors be retrenched. A reduction in government subsidy made it untenable for us to afford them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had to look from the perspective of the White Paper. It says all art companies under the umbrella of the Performing Arts Council must be privatised by 1999.&quot; Maas explains that theatre is no longer regarded as a viable profession for government funding and that all performers must look to the as yet non-functioning National Arts Council for support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Anglo-French Diplomacy, and the Initial Italo-Ethiopian Campaign of 1935-6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We saw last week how the League of Nations, faced by Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, branded fascist Italy as the aggressor, but imposed only ineffective sanctions. Now read on:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hoare-Laval Proposals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British and French foreign ministries, which also had no desire to see the imposition of an oil sanction, strove meanwhile to devise a compromise peace which would render it unnecessary to impose one. Proposals were duly formulated, after which Hoare went to Paris, on 7 December, to finalise them.  Their terms were then submitted to both Rome and Addis Ababa. They were also leaked to the French press, and thus almost immediately became known to the entire world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hoare-Laval plan, which from the geographical point of view was strikingly reminiscent of the Tripartite Convention of 1906, proposed that Ethiopia should cede to Italy more or less all the areas then occupied by the Italians, i.e. Tegray and Ogaden, and that Italy should be given &quot;economic rights&quot; over most of southern Ethiopia, except the very far west, which had earlier been considered a British sphere of influence. Ethiopia in return was to be offered an outlet to the sea at Asab, and a corridor through the Afar desert leading thereto, i.e. the very same arrangement which Ethiopia had found unsatisfactory when proposed by Italy seven years earlier, in 1928.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These proposals, which the Emperor described as &quot;a prize offering to the aggressors&quot;, led to a storm of indignation, in Britain and to a lesser extent throughout the world. Hoare was obliged to resign, and was replaced by Anthony Eden. In the general excitement public opinion, however, largely forgot about the question of an oil sanction. The British and French governments were thus able to continue their opposition thereto almost without debate. The policy of the new Foreign Secretary, it soon transpired, differed little from that of his predecessor. He thus claimed in the House of Commons, on 24 February 1936, that the limited sanctions then in force would &quot; ultimately have an important influence&quot;, and that there was therefore no need to extend them to oil, which, he declared, was merely &quot;a sanction like any other&quot;. This inane remark carried the day, even though it was regarded with incredulity in some opposition quarters. The British liberal newspaper, the Manchester Guardian, for example commented, &quot;The half-naked Abyssinian meeting a &quot;mechanised&quot; enemy could tell him otherwise&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Great Britain had Closed the Suez Canal&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British and French Governments remained also unwilling to contemplate closing the Suez Canal, which would almost certainly have brought the invasion to a halt. This was later recognised by the American President, Franklin Roosevelt, who observed, &quot;if Great Britain had closed the Suez Canal, Italy would have been balked in respect to Abyssinia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to impose the oil sanction, or to close the canal, resulted in the last analysis from the fact that the British and French Governments saw no interest in halting Mussolini's invasion. They were reluctant to see the Duce humiliated, and threatened by rebellion, let alone provoked into a hostile show of force, and driven into a closer military alliance with his ideological partner Hitler. Hugh Wilson, the American representative in Geneva, recalls, &quot;Time and again, I was told that sanctions applied to Italy must be such as not to drive that nation to desperation, not to push it to a point where it would assault the States applying the pressure&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial Resistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian army, though faced by a much more powerful foe in full command of the air, succeeded at the end of 1935 in launching a major counter- offensive, aimed at isolating the Italian position at Maqale. This operation was carried out by forces under three separate commands: On the western flank, Gojjam and Bagemder soldiers commanded by Ras Emru Hayla Sellase. In the centre, Ras Kasa, the overall commander of the northern front, with his three sons, Asfa Wassan, Abarra, and Wandwassan, and Ras Seyum Mangasha, with their men, composed respectively of Amharas and Tegrays. On the eastern wing, the soldiers of Ras Mulugeta Yeggazu, a veteran of the Adwa war and nominal Minister of War. These four main commanders, like their Italian opposite numbers at Adwa forty years earlier, had relatively little contact between each other. This, however, was not entirely a disadvantage, for the invaders broke the Ethiopian code, and were therefore informed as to Ethiopian radio and telegraph messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;Black Period&quot; for Fascist Arms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian Christmas Offensive, as it was sometimes called, drove the enemy back from the Takkaze River, out of much of the territory De Bono had captured. This enabled Ras Emru, the most successful of the three principal Rases, to defeat a force of Italian colonial troops at the pass of Dambagwina, and advance at several points as far as the Eritrean frontier. Some Italian observers described this as a &quot;black period&quot; for fascist arms. The invaders, however, threw all their forces into the struggle, and made extensive use of artillery, tanks, bombing, and, on Emru's front, mustard gas. The Ethiopian advance was halted, and decisively defeated, between 20 and 24 January 1936.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian victory in the above fighting, which came to be called the First Battle of Tamben, opened the way for a powerful new fascist offensive.  This was at first directed against Ras Mulugeta and the imperial troops, who were stationed on the natural fortress of Amba Aradam, south of Maqal. The Italians employed 170 aeroplanes and 280 cannon, and at one point dropped no less than forty tons of bombs in five hours, besides a vast quantity of mustard gas. Massed artillery fire, reminiscent of that of World War I, was also used. Ethiopian casualties were considerable, and included the aged Ras himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italians then turned their assault on Kasa and Seyum, whose forces were vastly inferior in numbers, let alone fire-power. The defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, but were fairly easily crushed, between 27 and 29 February, in the Second Battle of Tamben. The eastern and central Ethiopian fronts had thus both been broken, and the two Rases, to escape Italian encirclement, were obliged to withdraw precipitously, with what was left of their army, to join the Emperor at Qoram, in southern Tegray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the effects of this retreat was that Ras Emru's army, though still undefeated, was obliged to undertake a strategic withdrawal, across the Takkaze River, to avoid encirclement. This operation was rendered the more difficult by the fact that Dajazmach Ayalaw Berru, the ruler of Samen, and some of the Gojjam troops, had been in secret contact with the enemy, and were uninterested in continuing the struggle. Emru's retreat, known as the Battle of Shere, took place at the end of February and first days of March, and involved some of the fiercest fighting of the war. The invaders dropped as much as eighty tons of bombs on Emru's army, set the surrounding countryside on fire with incendiary devices, and made extensive use of mustard gas. The Ras later recalled that his men held firm against bombs, and put enemy tanks out of order with their bare hands, but could do nothing against gas: they could not &quot;kill&quot; such rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bombing of the Red Cross</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Royal Italian Air Force was meanwhile also engaged in the systematic bombing of British, Swedish, Egyptian and other international Red Cross hospitals and ambulances in Ethiopia. Attacks were so severe that virtually all foreign personnel were driven from the field. Dr John Melly, head of the British Red Cross unit, wrote, on 13April, &quot;This isn't a war - it isn't even a slaughter - its the torture of tens of thousands of defenceless men, women, and children, with bombs and poison gas.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Off to Asmara and Johnnie Walker wishes you a safe journey; travel to Langano and Black Label accompanies you to Debre Zeit; head for Ambo and Winston and Marlboro loom on the skyline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite international misconceptions of Ethiopia as a country ruined by war, famine and disease, world-wide companies have not been made blind to the huge marketing potential of Ethiopia. Is it this, or does a government desperate for economic expansion and investment make Ethiopia easy prey for exploitation by international money-grabbers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business is expanding fast - the last five years have seen a huge increase in advertising: Coca-Cola glares out at street corners, international airways signs drip from the buildings, even to the extent of sponsoring restaurants in the capital; Benetton has reached Addis and at every petrol station, there is a rival defiantly standing opposite. There can be no arguing that these developments have supplied thousands of jobs, that many people's lifestyles have been improved with an expanding economy, that increased investment results in greater opportunities; that the ongoing commercial developments will allow Ethiopia to gain standing in the international market, but do all these marketing and publicity campaigns spell affluence?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would appear that companies both local and international have free run over us and our lifestyles. Adverts dominate street corners, companies sponsor every programme on Ethiopian television. The government needs the money and thus allows advertising too much freedom. At a cost. The cost is to the environment and the culture into which the next generation is growing.  How many parents fight a weekly battle with their children on Sunday afternoons when their children become glued to their television sets for the next gripping installment of &quot;Acapulco Bay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;That's Incredible&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;...Do companies give no consideration to the standard of programme they are sponsoring - is there nothing more informative? Should television always be portraying a glitzy glamourised image of America which cannot help but become a role model for viewers? Unless the government takes a firm hand to closely monitor the suitability, quality and timing of programmes aired, we are in serious danger of becoming sponges, soaking up out-dated Americanism and harbouring ideals and ambitions that we do not wish the future generations to possess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One wonders if advertisers are really considering the interests of the consumer. Does roadside advertising really see us so happily on our way or welcome us to Ethiopia? What do you want to see when you arrive in the country- the real Ethiopia, or the money that companies are determined to make out of you during your stay? It is doubtful residents are really happy seeing huge boards blocking the views of the Entoto mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us catch the problem before it runs too far. It's up to the government to see beyond the flashing birr signs and look long-term to examine how much advertising is really worth and at what cost to the future. We are being exploited . For what standards do we sacrifice beauty and how much do we allow business to dominate the growth and development of the next generation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising promotional offers are zooming up. Shell's offer of a free trip to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics resulted in a 20-30% increase in sales. By 2000, manufacturers will be spending over half of their marketing budget on promotional offers such as these.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pepsi sponsors Ethiopian athletes; Gillette brings global sport to our screens and both privately-run Awash Bank and the government-owned Commercial Bank have recently initiated leaflets explaining their services to their customers: there is no doubt that promotional advertising is beneficial to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the West seems to think that we are easy prey - marketers are upping their ethnic advertising budgets in a climate where the minorities will account for 46.2% of the American population by 2050 and yet there is clear evidence to show that they give nothing for our welfare. We must boycott exploitation tragedies such as the Nestle Baby milk Developing- world campaign where free supplies of Nestle baby milk were given to breast-feeding mothers in African villages so that they stopped feeding and became dependent on a powdered milk which could not be afforded once their gratuity month's supply of formula milk had run out, by which time, their breast milk had dried up. Every tin of Nestle's Nido bought , contributes to allowing international companies to believe they can dominate us, that we will sit back and allow ourselves to be exploited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Competition makes marketing strategies and tactics ever more fierce. They are playing a game in which we are the die being rolled without a choice.  what's more, the government appears to be joining in. Isn't it time that we take a second look at the direction in which marketing is heading us?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the study on the restructuring of the Ethiopian Road Authority has been completed and its implementation may start in the current year;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Twenty-five middle-level construction training institutions are being set up in all the regions;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A proclamation providing for the establishment of a road maintenance fund has been approved by the Council of Ministers and is now before parliament for similar approval:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* during the first five months of the 1996/97 fiscal year, 58.4 km of asphalt roads and 78km of gravel roads have been constructed;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* 228 million birr has been earmarked for telecommunications development from own funds and foreign loans;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* 480,000 additional telephone lines will be laid out in the next two or three years as compared to 160,000 lines now existing;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* 300 rural towns will be provided with telephone lines when the telecommunications programme being implemented is completed;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* construction of a new airport in Addis Ababa is about to begin;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* construction work on Arba-Minch, Gondar, Lalibela, Axum and Mekele airports is progressing well;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* priority will be given to the implementation of the Gilgel-Gibe hydro- electric power project;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the plan to purchase 60-megawatt diesel generators is proceeding according to schedule;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the first geothermal power project in our country at Aluto-Langano is being implemented;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the 70-80 megawatt Tisabay hydroelectric power project will be under construction at the beginning of next year;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* maintenance and strengthening work on the existing Tisabay, Fincha and Koka hydropower stations is going on well;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Bahir-Dar-North Ethiopia and Gedo-Nekemte-Gimbi electric transmission lines are being constructed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority (EELPA) does not even have enough money for its day-to-day operations, let alone for the construction of new electric generation projects; this is largely because of low electricity tariff.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* electricity subsidies will be discontinued in the next twelve months and a new tariff will be issued shortly to implement the cancellation of subsidies;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* 597.67 million birr has been allocated to water resources development during the current fiscal year; In addition 508.9 million birr has been appropriated by regional administrations for medium-scale irrigation and water resources development projects;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the only irrigation project being carried by the central government is the Gode project and it is behind schedule in its implementation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Most of the health and education sector projects are being implemented by regional administrations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* budgets will continue to be transferred from development projects whose implementation is lagging behind to those which are being implemented fast;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* At present, the government annual recurrent budget and up to fifty percent of the capital budget are covered from our own financial resources;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the government's strategy is to reach a stage where the country can cover a large part of the development budget through improving revenue collection, reducing non-developmental expenditures and making government development - oriented institutions more or less financially self-sufficient;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* top priority is being accorded to manpower development and civil service reform, including government finance policy on which a proclamation has been submitted to parliament for debate and approval;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a proclamation on the restructuring of the Customs Authority is now before parliament;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Similarly, a programme to reform the inland revenue service is under way;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the telecommunications agency is now operating under its greatly reformed organizational and operational structure;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* last year regional administrations used their own budgets as security to borrow loans from banks and to on-lend to farmers;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* some 400,000 farmers participated in the government's agricultural extension service package last year;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the government's agricultural extension programme is being expanded to cover animal and bee resource development;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Among the economic policy objectives of the government, special attention is being paid to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Creating a stable macroeconomic environment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* implementing the principles of a market economy stage by stage;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* putting in place a conducive economic policy and implementation framework;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the government has succeeded in controlling inflation, reducing deficit financing and the supply of money;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the government has stopped borrowing from the domestic banking system;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the government repaid 978 million birr of its outstanding bank debt during the last five months of the 1996/97 fiscal year;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* importers are supplied with foreign exchange for the importation of all goods except used clothing;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the rate of exchange is to be maintained within five percent of positive or negative variation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* from Tir 1987 to Tikimt 1984 one hundred sixty-four retail shops, 54 small-sized hotels and restaurants, 42 factories and 2 big hotels were put up for auction. Of these, 109 retail shops, 16 medium-sized hotels and restaurants and 17 factories have been privatized;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the trade licensing law which has now been submitted to parliament after having been endorsed by the Council of Ministers stipulates that applicants should be able to obtain trade licenses within 5 days from the date of application provided basic requirements are fulfilled;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Similarly, imported goods should be cleared through the customs in seven days;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Corruption will be penalized with long imprisonment, not with only monetary fines as is the case now;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is all very nice to hear all this good economic news and be told about the very positive plans for the future, but millions of Ethiopians especially in urban areas, are still suffering acutely from lack of food security, employment, housing, potable water, electricity, and health and educational facilities; with respect to economic plans drawn up for the future, the problem, as always, is the divergence of words from deeds. Why was nothing said about the number of new jobs created during the first five months of the 1996/97 fiscal year? Practically no housing construction is being undertaken by private individuals in urban areas because of the unavailability of land and water and electricity shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is surprising to note that despite the grand road construction plan, what has actually been achieved in the entire country during the first five months of the current fiscal year is the construction of only about 136 km of roads, 78 km of which are gravel. The Gilgel-Gibe hydroelectric power project is still lagging behind in the midst of an electricity shortage nation-wide that is threatening to seriously arrest the country's economic development.  On the other hand, the plan to purchase 60 - megawatt diesel generators reverses the previous government's strategy of converting to hydropower motivated by the high cost of fuel-based electricity generation. Concerning geothermal power, some twenty years ago a German expert on an IMF mission here asked an Ethiopian geothermal power expert who said the first geothermal power project was being implemented, &quot;when may we expect the first electric light bulb powered by this project?&quot; The Ethiopian expert blinked his eyes and said, &quot;in about a year's time!&quot; There is still no such electric light bulb twenty years later!  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EELPA is said to be strapped for money; how come it is buying a lot Tof government treasury bills and bonds? Looking at the amounts of the face values of treasury bills for which EELPA has been bidding on the T. bills auction market, one would think it is awash with cash, not hard up for money, that is, unless one wants to use cash shortage as a pretext for raising the electricity tariff! Regarding irrigation, the only irrigation project being carried out by the central government is the Gode project which is way behind schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is rather strange for a country that professes to have achieved self- sufficiency in food. Fertilizer is no use without water! On the question of budget transfers, care should be taken not to let this procedure be abused.  There have been instances where transfers have been effected to favoured regions on this pretext. It is often argued in this regard that mere financial regional budget allocations are not enough if state-owned and often private construction, transport and other implementation capacities are deployed in favoured regions as a matter of priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trick is simple enough: give a region a budget; send all the construction firms to the favoured regions or region; complete all the projects in the favoured region way ahead of schedule; tell the first region,&quot; hard luck! we are taking your money because you haven't been able to use it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of bank borrowing by regional administrations, a dangerous precedent is being set in a situation where the financial management of regional administrations is highly unreliable. Regional administrations are being allowed not only to borrow money on their own account, but also to engage in lending , which is a highly specialized area of finance usually restricted to banks and other financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expect widespread financial mismanagement and default!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of expanding the government's agricultural extension programme to the livestock and other animal breeding sectors, caution should be exercised to back it up with in-depth domestic and external market studies.  Also, care should be taken in the screening of hybrid livestock imported from abroad, especially since the so-called mad cow disease can no more be taken lightly!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to the claim that the government has stopped borrowing from the domestic banking system, what about government treasury bills bought by the CBE, Awash International Bank and other private banks? In fact, what about loans being taken by regional administrations, which are part of the government structure? Isn't the Ministry of Finance taking any direct advances from the National Bank of Ethiopia? Hard to believe!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the promises to grant an applicant a trade license in 5 days, and clear goods through the Customs in seven days are great if they can be implemented. We have our doubts, though, because we are not getting land in sixty days in Addis Ababa, like it was promised in the revised investment code, although 60 days is far too long. Is there any good reason why investors and home builders cannot have access to land on an hourly basis!?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Theodros Teshome's 'Gilbet Alem' was screened at the German Cultural Institute Monday and received warm applause. 'Gilbet Alem' is a 130 minute film set in the town of Jimma. The story begins with a fire that causes the death of a farmer and his wife. The film is fast paced and smooth as it follows the life of the only survivor, their son young Muluken (played by Muluken Teshome) as he tries to find his sister and make a living in Jimma.  Moreover, not only has Muluken, a simple country boy, to deal with the strangeness of town life, but as luck would have it his life is in danger when he witnesses the murder of an undercover policeman by a notorious gang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Gilbet Alem' is the first film for Theodros--a purchasing and supplies management graduate. Preferring not to go to Muger, where he was stationed, Theodros chose instead to stay in Addis and continue to work at a small photo studio--as he had done all through college. Soon, Theodros who had been taking photographs since grade eight, began to get offers from other studios in city. Working for the highest bidder seemed to be the order of the day as Theodros made his way around the well-known studios such as Kulibi, Photo Fili and Photo Fine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the secondary school leaving certificate that put an end to the only career that Theodros wanted to follow because of family influence-- to be a lawyer like his uncle. Nonetheless, it was a neighbour from his Jimma days that had a big impact on his life. &quot;I was turning out to be somewhat of trouble maker,&quot; he recalled, but the man who owned a photo shop asked Theodros' parents if it would not be a good idea if they let the boy come and 'work' with him after school. They readily agreed and from the 'bad boy' image that he was fast cultivating, Theodros began to develop a passion for photography.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though exceptionally talented at photography, it was only while at the Addis Ababa Commercial College that he first used a video camera. &quot;I was at a wedding to take photos when the video man failed to turn up. As I was the only one there whose task was remotely related, they asked my to fill in. I knew nothing about video cameras but I did not let on. I pretended I was used to another kind of camera and casually asked the groom how this particular one functioned. &quot; Theodros never did see the video he took but since he was given more money than they agreed, he figures it could not have been that bad.  From then on taking videos of weddings and such became a normal thing for him. Theodros has not had any professional training and &quot;Those places that do offer courses had nothing new to teach me,&quot; he says. How he learnt to improve was by looking at videos taken by professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a talk with one writer, Theodros began to get interested in the possibility of making a film. Nothing came out of this and when his mother died, he went back to Jimma where the rest of the family lived. The eldest of six children, Theodros felt a deep sense of responsibility. While there he saw his brother Muluken in a play and was very impressed . The fate of Muluken, who had dropped out of school and turned to bad habits had weighed on Theodros' mind for some time. &quot;I knew if I just gave him money he would spend it in no time, so I approached him with the idea of taking part in a film. He agreed but did not put much faith in it succeeding.&quot; As Muluken went about finding the cast, Theodros gone down to the serious business of writing the script. Not satisfied with what he wrote he approached several script writers to help him out. Some wanted high fees while others asked for a share in the profits. A script writer from Jimma, Endale Chanko however only asked for one thing--that his name appears on screen. This was an acceptable proposal and Theodros' film--that was begun with 3,000 birr and finally cost 24,000 birr-- started to take shape. (The cast's expense was covered by him and all have been promised a share in the profits.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the total 23 casts (Theodros himself had a small part), only six were members of a drama club. The rest came from different backgrounds including a driver, an Amharic teacher and a martial arts instructor. The parts he had great difficulty in filling were that of the leading actress and the main character's sister. That problem was solved however when he went to the small town of Agaro to cover a wedding and saw one of the bridesmaids. When her sister turned up and he saw the uncanny resemblance between her and his brother it made up his mind. With the help of the girl's uncle, Theodros managed to get them to agree to take the parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I had money we filmed, when there was nothing everyone went their separate ways,&quot; Theodros said, explaining that it took a year to wrap up production. Filming was done on a VHS camera and that affected the quality especially of the colour--but what Theodros found most constraining was not owning the video camera and the loss of 'experimental freedom' he lost as a result of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The end product was nonetheless impressive. &quot;I was very much astonished and surprised that one young man could do such a thing,&quot; exclaimed Mrs Sabina Hagemann, director of the German Cultural Institute. To her Theodros is someone with potential and his commitment to portray the good about life in the countryside, is commendable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theodros Teshome is waiting expectantly to see how 'Gilbet Alem' will do.  In the meantime a new idea for a second film has already begun forming in his head. With the promise that, &quot;the first 10,000 birr will go to buy a proper video camera,&quot; Theodros' second film promises to come out more polished and well worth seeing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - A two-man Swiss mission left Monday 10 March after conducting a preliminary evaluation into ways their government could assist Ethiopia in its ongoing decentralisation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their two-week stay, Luc Vodoz from the Swiss based C.E.A.T, -a firm engaged mostly with urban and country planning (&quot;anything to do with territory&quot;) in connection with local economy, transport, energy and conflict management--and Dr. Valentin Zellweger from the foreign ministry of Switzerland met with bilateral donors, various officials including those from the prime minister's office, as well as the speaker of the federal council .  Switzerland being a federal country-- and conceding that while in its case it was a bottom up approach, for Ethiopia it is the reverse-- Dr. Zellweger noted, &quot;We have a particular interest in knowing your experience, in knowing if there is a way for Switzerland to try to assist you to think about our experience we have with decentralisation.&quot; According to the mission, the Swiss government will , at the latest, make its decision on their recommendation by September.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission visited Jijiga in the Somali region where they concentrated on the judiciary and administration. &quot;We wanted to concentrate on an emerging region,&quot; they said in explanation as to why that particular region will act as the 'testing ground'. The two were suitably impressed by what they encountered in the region and found themselves, &quot;very surprised to find so many people who are convinced that they need to look into the future.&quot; What the region needed, Dr. Zellweger said, was financial assistance. &quot;It is impressive,&quot; he remarked, &quot;everything is there. But it is like a mould, you have to put in the funds, the infrastructure needs and the capacity building.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Switzerland has assisted several countries such as Bolivia, Madagascar and Burkina Faso when they were undergoing federalisation.</SPAN></P>

Meles met with all the senior officials of government in India to discuss ways of furthering bilateral relations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Indian Embassy in Addis Ababa told Addis Tribune that discussions were held with members of the business community as well as the agricultural sector. Whilst in the Punjab, Meles visited an agricultural university and witnessed Indian methods of integrating academic knowledge and research results with practical hands-on farming. India will maintain its policies concerning Ethiopian nationals studying there; a policy which sometimes forfeits a place for an Indian national, said the embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit was in fact extended, a rare occurrence for official visits, and the feeling from both countries was a productive one. There will be a catalogue fair of Indian products at the end of this month, disclosed the embassy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Professor Johannes Bircher first came to Ethiopia in January 1974. He was with a mission of 46 Swiss people who set out to run and equip the dormant Black Lion Hospital, then the Prince Mekonnen Hospital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was forced to leave shortly after due to the political situation but returned for a visit in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month Prof. Bircher was back in Ethiopia serving as external examiner at the Department of Medicine of the Medical Faculty of the Addis Ababa University (AAU). He told us that six physicians took the examination as specialists in internal medicine and all passed. Prof. Bircher said he had the opportunity to congratulate the staff and wrote a good report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the professor met Her Excellency the German Ambassador to Ethiopia, to explore opportunities for co-operation between the Medical Faculty of the University of Witten/Herdecke in Germany, where Professor Bircher is Dean, and their counterpart at the Addis Ababa University. This was met favourably by the German ambassador. Consequently, the professor visited the Academic Vice President of the AAU, DR. Hailu Ayele, and the Dean of the Medical Faculty, Dr. Milkias Shamebo, who were both interested in the idea of co-operation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - As an American who is residing in Ethiopia and who has traveled extensively in the country, I read your February 28th article on tourism in Ethiopia with great interest. I have several comments about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear from the article, if not the headline, that there were nowhere near 95,000 actual tourists in Ethiopia in 1994. The table on page 4 lists only 79,125 persons, of which only 18,056 were here on vacation. Businessmen are not tourists. Neither are transit passengers. On page 4, your economics correspondent states that the majority of &quot;tourists&quot; spent only one day in Ethiopia. These people may be transit passengers forced by airlines schedules or cancellations to spend a day or a night in the country, but they are clearly not tourists. No one can pretend to be a tourist if he spends only one day there. If you add the categories of &quot;Transit&quot; and &quot;Not stated&quot; in the table on page 4, you account for more than 47% of the people in the table.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People do not come to Ethiopia to see wildlife, other than birds. The big game in Ethiopia has been, and is still, being killed. When I was in Mago National Park in November 1995, an elephant had just been killed but the game wardens could do nothing about it because they had not a single vehicle to patrol the park or chase poachers. Tourists and animal lovers go to Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, South Africa, etc., to see game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it undoubted that Ethiopia offers more historical monuments and sites than any other country in Africa, except Egypt. But visiting those sights is not a pleasant experience. The Goha, Roha and Yeha hotels in Gondar, Lalibela and Axum are considered to be the best hotels in those towns. Their prices are fairly low by international standards ($36 per night). But their accommodations are very far below foreigners' expectations in comfort and facilities. The beds in all of them are so soft as to be uncomfortable, none have hot water all of the time (and the Roha seldom has hot water at any time or any water at most times), none have room service, electricity is sporadic at best and telephones are poor or nonexistent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The domestic service of Ethiopian Airlines is, in a word, terrible. It is insulting to tourists to charge them more than the service is worth -- at least more than the local people are charged for the identical service.  (Foreign tourists get discounts in other countries -- such as Eurailpasses in western Europe.) For their high fares, they get unreliable or nonexistent service. In three trips around the Historic Route, involving a total of 15 flights, I can count fewer than half which were on schedule (that is within an hour of the timetable). In April 1996, flights were simply canceled on the pretext of lack of airplane fuel. (As if a company which has the huge foreign exchange earnings of Ethiopian Airlines did not have the money to buy fuel!  Far worse is the suggestion which I heard that management had not ordered the fuel in time to have it available when needed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the airline shows its incredible inefficiency and its contempt for its passengers' convenience by making them appear at the airport 11/2 hours before a flight, even in a place like Lalibela. What does one do at the Lalibela airport hut for 11/2 hours? The government also shows its indifference to tourists by having no facilities for passengers at airports for the two major tourist sites in Ethiopia - Lalibela and Axum. ( I know that new facilities, runways at least, are being constructed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, one of the greatest barriers to tourism in Ethiopia is the Ethiopians themselves. Ethiopians are perfectly delightful and gracious in their homes and in other personal contacts. But in the street and in public facilities they are harassing and rude. How many times have you been at a postal clerk's window, being served, when another person puts his or her envelope on top of yours, demanding to be served immediately? How many times have you seen a foreigner (especially a white one) being followed by children and adults demanding money, trying to pick a pocket, persistently shouting &quot; farengi&quot;, or throwing rocks? The first comment any foreigner who is resident in Ethiopia makes about another African or Asian country he has visited is that the people leave him alone. Taking a walk in Addis Ababa or any other town else is simply an unpleasant experience. In addition, the staff of many hotels and other facilities do not usually make a tourist feel welcome.  Smiles are few and far between. A tourist seldom hears polite phrases such as, &quot;we hope that you enjoy (or enjoyed) your stay here&quot;. Most people employed in the tourist industry treat the tourists as if they were doing him a favor by providing the service which the tourist pays for. This will not change until Ethiopians have enough self respect, self discipline and respect for other people that they change how they behave in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another serious drawback to tourism in Ethiopia is the high cost of getting here. Airfares to Addis Ababa from Europe or the United States are outrageously high. Apparently, the Ethiopian government does not permit very much competition in fares. I am sure that this is done to protect Ethiopian Airline's very high fares (which your economics correspondent seems to believe should be a high priority).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two discount airlines, Egypt and Saudia, have only two flights each per week. It costs much less to fly from Europe or North America to Nairobi or even Cape Town than it does to Addis Ababa, even though both of them are farther away. In Cape Town, one sees advertisements for fares to Chicago, USA of less than US$950 round trip. It costs over US$1800 (the discount fare) to make the round trip from Addis Ababa, even though the trip from Addis Ababa is thousands of kilometers shorter. So long as the government uses its power over landing rights to protect Ethiopian Airlines' high international fares, the rest of the tourists industry will suffer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its current primitive tourist facilities, Ethiopia can attract only the adventure traveler. The adventure traveler makes appeals to those who want to go far off the beaten track. This kind of traveler will forego creature comforts taken for granted in Europe, Kenya, Southern Africa, etc.; communication with family back home; adequate medical care if injured or ill; reliability in travel arrangements and a pleasant experience for the sake of being somewhere his friends have not been. Obviously, Ethiopia cannot pride services like reliable transportation, medical care, telephones, potable water, etc. to foreigners when these services are not available to citizens either. But it cannot expect tourists in any significant numbers to subject themselves to the conditions which exist here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Word of mouth advertising is almost the only advertising there is for travel in Ethiopia. One certainly does not see advertisements for Ethiopia in newspapers and magazines published in Europe or North America. And, unfortunately, word of mouth reports of travelers in Ethiopia have many negative aspects. Especially this is so when the travelers compare their experiences here with their experiences in Eritrea, Yemen, Kenya, Zimbabwe, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As your economics correspondent pointed out, tourism is the world's largest industry. In many developed countries, it is disliked as a low wage, low skills employer. In a country with high illiteracy, low levels of skills and high unemployment, tourism would be a boon to people who have no other prospects. Hotels employ gardeners, maintenance personnel and others who do not need to know English or other languages because they do not deal directly with guests. Expansion of the tourist industry in Ethiopia would bring many benefits to the people and the economy. But expansion will not happen until tourists leave the country with more pleasant than unpleasant experiences.  And that will not happen until the tourists services are improved and tourists are treated with the respect that they deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think that Ethiopia could offer one of the best experiences the world has to offer tourists. Its climate (about eight months of sunshine outside of the rainy seasons), historical sites, trekking, mountain climbing, river rafting and animal viewing have much potential. But the industry will remain only a potential industry until tourists are made to feel comfortable and welcome and receive good value for their money.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Committee To Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported today that 185 journalists were in prison in 24 countries at the end of 1996, and 27 were killed in the line of duty. This is a grim statistic that is published in Attacks on the Press in 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, Ethiopia is mentioned as one of the offenders in the CPJ report.  Eighteen journalists are in jail. Theoretically, Ethiopia has included all it takes in the Constitution to assure freedom of speech and the right of journalists. Article 29 of Ethiopia's Constitution enumerates the right of thought, opinion and expression. But we don't practice what we preach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have to learn and build a tradition that the individual is the best judge of how to write and speak. We have to destroy the perception that freedom of expression is a threat to government. Citizens should be encouraged to be an active citizenry &quot;discussing without fear, the conduct of the public Servants, in every department of the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We pray that Ethiopia shall not be mentioned as an offender in CPJ's 1997 report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - A large number of farmers from Gojam have made their way to Addis Ababa to appeal to the federal government against what they saw as unfair treatment against them in their home province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camped out at the St. George Church park, the men voiced complaints against officials back in Gojam who labelled all farmers who had any involvement in the various associations during the former government's time as &quot;bureaucrats&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since two months ago, the fleeing farmers said, the so called &quot; Bureaucrats&quot; have had their land confiscated and only allowed a tiny plot of land. Similar action has reportedly been taken against the family's of those who have held posts during Emperor Haile Selassie's time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we asked them what we shall feed our children they told us to give them stones,&quot; the farmers bitterly recalled. They also showed papers they say they had to smuggle in. These contain signatures of all those in their locality that had their land taken from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the men claim that apart from the food they get from the city's inhabitants, the Red Cross had also extended its help. However, Ato Kassahun Indayalu head of the Addis Ababa Red Cross Branch denied any knowledge of the farmer's presence in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to some of the farmers, they will not go back home until they get assurance that they will get equal share of the land and moreover will not be punished for having come to Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $1 million prize will be awarded only if the runner runs his two-mile race at Helengo, Netherlands, in less than 8 minutes, something that has never been done at the rarely contested distance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day in Toronto, two Olympic sprint champions, Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey, will race against each other at 150 metres in a similar, privately sponsored $2 million race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adidas will try to promote its head-to-head match as a logical follow-up to Roger Bannister's conquest of the 4-minute mile. Athletes and sponsors have been arguing that athletics needs to increase its profile, and these boxing- style promotions are a good start. But the age-old protectors of track and field are worried that shoe companies such as Adidas and Nike will organize their own competitions to the detriment of Grand Prix meets, world championships and the Olympics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - &quot;... if merchants, paying and accepting market prices, made gains, this was all right, and if they suffered losses, this was bad luck or else a penalty for incompetence so long as gain or loss resulted from the unhampered working of the market mechanism though not if it resulted, for example, from price fixing by public authority or monopolistic concerns&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- &quot;Scholastic Doctors and Natural Law Philosophers&quot;, History of Economic Analysis, Joseph A. Schumpeter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have seen that he (Aristotle) condemned monopoly prices. It is not far- fetched to equate, for Aristotle's purpose, monopoly prices with prices that some individual or group of individuals have set to their own advantage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, free-market prices were accepted as just even by the ancients, but monopoly pricing or price fixing was unforgivably condemned. We are alluding to the hoary concept of &quot;Just price&quot; in connection with the very substantial rent increases made by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church on its real property recently restituted to it after having been nationalized by the Derg. The rent hikes are remarkable for at least two things: the swiftness with which they came so soon after restitution; and their unorthodoxly unconscionable magnitude.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter feature could be assessed from the following mini-sample of the rent increases made:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous rent(in birr) -- New rent (in birr) -- %change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gebre-Tensai pastry: 1280 -- 22,000 -- 1,619</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saba Snack: 400 -- 3,000 -- 650</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photo Lina: 450 -- 3876 -- 761</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammud Music Shop: 420 -- 6728 -- 1502</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seiko Pastry: 288 -- 18,700 -- 6393</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awash Power Engineering: 650 -- 8,265.40 -- 1,172</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Awal Tailor Shop: 70 -- 1,142.40 -- 1532</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Source: &quot;Reporter&quot; (Amharic), Megabit 1, 1989 E.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, there is hardly any doubt that the rent increases are stratospheric.  They are to be effective as of March 10, 1997. The rent increases are based on three different rates per square meter of floor space in church-owned apartment and other buildings used for commercial purposes. Rooms and flats on first to third floors are charged at the rate of 85 birr per square meter while fourth and fifth floors and rooms above sixth floor are assessed at the rate of 76 birr and 68 birr, respectively. The comparative average rate for government-owned buildings is reported to be 92 birr per square meter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lessees affected by the rent hikes petitioned the Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, his Holiness Abune Paulos, on March 6, 1997 on the premises of the Patriarchate. The concerned spokesman of the Patriarchate told the gathered petitioners that the rent increases were based on studies made on house rents charged for similar government-owned and private-owned houses. He underscored the contention that market forces guided the measure to revise the rents. Among the important reasons which necessitated the upward revision were, he said, uncertainty about the continuation of government subventions for the church, the obligation to pay wages to church personnel and the need to maintain church-owned buildings and improve their facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After launching into the history of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the trials and tribulations it passed through over the years, the Patriarch, His Holiness Abuna Paulos, told the petitioners on his part that the rent increases were necessitated by the uncertainty of financial support from the government budget in the future and not out of cruelty or bad intent. &quot;There was a time as when the Ethiopian Orthodox Church owned a third of the country's land, but what should it do in times of financial distress?&quot;, said the Patriarch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand one petitioner bitterly commented &quot;I am dismayed to the discover that the spiritual father who I thought would reverse the decision which increased the rent spoke not as a father but as an economist. I shall henceforth have neither the strength nor the stamina to stand on the premises of the church.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Patriarch did however give room for discussion by agreeing to meet with the group again. He in fact suggested the lessees go and study the changes, and then return with suggestions. Inside sources say that the Patriarch as a spiritual leader would probably accommodate the request of the business group to a certain extent. As a result, lessees on Thursday met at the Addis Ababa Chamber and have elected 13 people to prepare a proposal for the Patriarch.  Interestingly, unlike the case of Region 14, both the Church and the businessmen have taken the route for consultation instead of confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What would an economist say about the rent hikes? If it is the free market that made the increases, then it must be a very special kind of free market.  It is not often that free markets send rents skyrocketing by as high as over 6000 percent! Without a shadow of doubt, papal economics of the brand of the Roman Catholic Church of the Middle Ages would denounce it as outrageous. It would be unorthodox in the extreme because it would violate the guiding principle of the &quot;just price&quot;, which essentially upheld the fairness of market-determined prices, but ran counter to monopoly pricing or price fixing by any organized body or organ. Hence, Thomas Aquinas, the great medieval religious philosopher, would have condemned rent increases of the above magnitude and their manner of determination. Similarly, Aristotle, the encyclopedic intellect of ancient times, would have described them as grossly unethical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we are now on the doorstep of the third millennium. Would it be appropriate to invoke the economic reasoning of the Middle Ages and ancient times? The essential truth of the matter is that it would be. Monopoly pricing and price fixing are still heavily frowned upon. Are the rent increases made by the administration of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church a result of monopoly power? There is a considerable body of evidence to show that they are. Let us, for now, simply try to pursue the following rudimentary line of reasoning: land is a state monopoly in Ethiopia; as a result, its supply on the market is heavily controlled; as a result of which its current prices are sky-high; house rents are extremely high not only because of exorbitant land prices, but also because the supply of houses is severely restricted by the artificial shortage of land created by the restriction on its supply which in turn is created by the said state monopoly on land; Hence, house rents are determined not in a context of free markets for land and houses, but rather in a context of state monopoly on land and the derived control on the supply of houses and buildings. So, the administration of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church made the rent increases in a situation where the supply of houses and buildings is restricted by state monopoly on land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, the state itself owns 51 percent of the urban housing stock, compounding the monopoly position of the state in the housing sector. Clearly, the rent hikes were based not on the free play of the forces of demand and supply, but on the forces operating in a highly controlled housing market.  Monopoly pricing is unethical and usually unbearably high, which was why the affected renters were bitter about it all. We would also suggest that government budgetary support for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church continue until such a time as the church is able to generate sufficient revenue to carry out its mission. Unorthodox economics would be hopelessly out of place in a church renowned for its orthodoxy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the misconception that all business people are by definition overly rich and therefore can afford and bear any rent, price or tax imposed on them should be put to rest. Actually, most people in business earn just decent incomes enough to support themselves and their families and to keep their businesses going, and with a bit of luck, expanding. Hence, any excessive increases in the costs of doing business, like the rent increases discussed above, would adversely affect not only their incomes, but also the employment opportunities they have created for their compatriots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occasionally, moderate rent and price revisions may be justified, but abrupt and precipitous rent increases of the magnitudes now made by the authorities of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church would be unjust. Further, it would badly tarnish the public image of the officials of he Ethiopian Orthodox Church to be embroiled in pecuniary disputes at a time when they confronted by multifarious controversies of the religions and spiritual nature. We would strongly advise the authorities of the Church to err on the side of mercy and moderation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SESHEGO - More than 10 000 mourners attended the joint funeral of four independent taxi drivers on Sunday who were murdered execution style two weeks ago and dumped in a cave in the Northern Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers at the ceremony at Seshego Stadium near Pietersburg turned the funeral into a campaign against taxi violence in the province, accusing warring taxi organisations of using the lives of their passengers and drivers as commodities in their bids for increased power and profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are supposed to be driving our clients safely to their destinations, but instead thousands have been killed to further the interests of the taxi owners,&quot; said Federated Long Distance Taxi Association (FELDTA) president, Fanyana Manganyi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This monotonous warfare must end before our passengers decide to desert the taxi trade altogether and start using some alternative transport system.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 14 men were arrested by police last week shortly after the bodies of the four Bosekaboeja Taxi Association (BTA) drivers were found in caves near Burgersfort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, the four deceased were abducted by rival drivers from the South African Long Distance Taxi Association (SALDTA) after attempts to encourage BTA driver to defect and join SALDTA were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four men had had their hands tied behind their backs before being shot numerous times in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the clashes, another BTA taxi driver was robbed of R1500 cash, which he used as a diversion to escape from his pursuers. BTA treasurer, Abraham Mokoadi (39) was also shot in the leg while leaping</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Not even former ANC senator Patrick Mogale's ancestors and muti could keep him out of prison this week when police arrested him at a court hearing in Graskop for refusing to pay maintenance to an under-aged girl he impregnated in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police whisked the belligerent former politician and current sangoma away on Wednesday to begin serving a three year prison term in Nelspruit Prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mogale was kicked out of parliament and banned from the ANC for 5-years after the Sunday Times revealed last year that he had got the 14-year-old daughter of his best friend pregnant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the court case where his attorney branded journalists as &quot;dirty liberal Jews&quot;, Sunday Times also discovered that Mogale had previously been investigated by the KaNgwane Government for allegedly operating a sex-for- marks ring at the Mshadza Senior Secondary School, where he was the principal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was never charged, but was instead transferred out of the region after parents protested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mogale was still a school principal in 1992, when he allegedly raped his best friend and neighbour's daughter on two separate occasions. Her parents only found out about the incidents when she realised she was pregnant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although they confronted him, Mogale refused to accept financial responsibility for the girl or his child and so they sued him in the maintenance court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An arrest warrant was issued for Mogale after the ignored the court's order to pay R300 per month, but he managed to evade the police for more than one year by moving between his home in Bushbuckridge and Parliament in Cape Town.  After Sunday Times reported on the police search, he handed himself in to police in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost immediately after loosing his R15 000 per month senator's salary and brand new Mercedes Benz, Mogale signed up for a crash course at a sanusi school and became a popular Bushbuckridge sangoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, continued to refuse to pay the R300 per month maintenance and R4000 arrears he was ordered to by the court and also swore that he would never &quot;bow to Western Law when this is clearly a traditional matter&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not even a contempt of court and statutory rape charges managed to sway his insistence on the issue and he instead offered to give the girl's family a goat and possibly marry her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outraged girl's family, who are devote Christians, rejected the offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, more than two years after his first court appearance in the Bushbuckridge Magistrate's Court, Mogale was arrested at the Graskop Magistrate's Court where he had appeared yet again for refusing to pay maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warrant Officer George Qwabe confirmed on Friday that Mogale was in a communal cell at Nelspruit Prison, where he will be put to work in the prison's administrative section for three years because of his &quot;academic record and achievements&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga's contentious multi-billion rand deal with the Dolphin Group is threatening to boil over into a fully blown diplomatic incident after the alleged fraudulent use of Kenya president Daniel arap Moi's name by the head of the Mpumalanga Parks Board (MPB).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPB chief executive officer, Alan Gray insisted last month that he had received a personal letter from Moi vindicating the Dubai-based Dolphin Group's president, Ketan Somaia of any dubious business dealings or other scandals in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has since however refused to make copies of the letter public, or take calls from Kenya's High Commissioner in South Africa, Justice Mudavadi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray's other business dealings also came under the spotlight this week, after a Mail &amp; Guardian investigation discovered that at least two of his companies hold significant contracts with the MP.SOURCE&amp;DATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.TEXT</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existence of the letter from President Moi, which allegedly clears Somaia of all wrongdoing in a R35-million security equipment tender for which he was paid seven years ago but for which the government never received any goods, has been repeatedly denied by Moi's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin, which cut a secret 50-year deal with Gray for the commercial monopoly of Mpumalanga's key tourism attractions, including the Blyde River Canyon, various state owned game reserves and Pilgrim's Rest, has also attempted to prevent M&amp;G reporting on the use of Moi's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Widespread public outcry to the deal, however, forced Mpumalanga's provincial government to step in and negotiate amendments to the contract, including a 25-year reduction and the exclusion of Pilgrim's Rest and the Manyeleti Game Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not care about the contract or the deal. But the use of our President's name is serious. Despite phoning him numerous times over the past three weeks, I have failed to speak to Gray or even get past his secretary - instead I am always told he is out or in meetings,&quot; explains Mudavadi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have left messages for him to return my calls, but have yet to receive any reply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting that it was &quot;inconceivable&quot; that President Moi would ever personally send a letter to Gray, who is described by Mudavadi as a &quot; relatively junior official&quot;, the High Commissioner said on Wednesday that &quot; this whole thing still sounds very strange to me and my fellow diplomats&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to know if this supposed letter really exists and if so, what is Gray doing with it. The only letter vindicating Somaia and acknowledged as being from Kenya is one from Public Accounts chairman Michael Wamalwa - and it has been withdrawn after it was revealed to be irregular,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior High Commission official, who traveled to Nelspruit last week in an attempt to get further information about the letter told M&amp;G that &quot;Gray is playing cat and mouse games with us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president is very touchy about people using his name and he vehemently denies ever writing the letter. We also have a big problem with Somaia's explanation of this episode,&quot; said the official, who refused to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somaia insisted to us that Gray meant the letter was from him as president of Dolphin and not from Moi. But how can Somaia, who is at the very centre of this controversy, write a letter clearing himself - especially when Gray tries to use the letter to refute those allegations on national TV. It just doesn't hold water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possibility that Gray had perhaps been given a fraudulent letter from President Moi's office, signed in the name of the president and clearing Somaia, had been considered, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internal investigations into the possibility were being conducted, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray has previously insisted that he cannot make the letter public until he receives council from both his and Somaia's legal advisors. He has consistently refused to be drawn on why he would need to consult with Somaia's attorney's when the letter supposedly comes from President Moi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When quizzed about Mudavadi's attempts to reach him this week, Gray refused to give either a telephonic interview or answer any questions verbally but he did request written questions for his immediate attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when these were submitted, his office replied that he was unavailable to answer them as he was &quot;an exceptionally busy person (who) is not available at your beck and call ... our office runs on a very tight schedule and cannot attend to matters at your request whatever the time of day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His personal assistant, Alison Zweers, also denied that any previous attempts had been made by M&amp;G to contact Gray on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst the questions M&amp;G wished to put to Gray on Wednesday were queries about the size and terms of his package with MPB after an earlier confirmation that he is not a civil servant but instead serves as CEO on a fixed-term contract basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former business associates allege that Gray has signed surety papers indicating he earned more than R50 000 per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental MEC, David Mkhwanazi, also declined to specify exactly how much Gray earned but said that his salary was based on what a private-sector managing director, who controlled a company with an asset base equivalent to the MPB, would earn. &quot;His salary is also directly linked to his performance and to how much money he is able to generate for the MPB,&quot; added Mkhwanazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray was appointed CEO after serving in the KaNgwane Parks Board as its financial director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a contract worker, Gray seems entitled to continue running his string of tourism, transport and medical rescue companies - most of which have significant contracts with the MPC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All MPB employees, for example, are contractually obliged to take out membership with the Nelspruit based medical rescue company, Life Crisis - which is fully owned by Gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast majority of MPB's aerial game counting, darting and capture contracts are also awarded to Lowveld Helicopter Services - again a company that Gray has significant shares in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most other provincial government departments, including Environmental Affairs and the Premier's Office also make extensive use of Lowveld Helicopter Services without any tender procedures being followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While admitting that it is compulsory for MPB employees to sign up with Life Crisis, and that the company was appointed without being submitted to a tender process, Gray stressed last week that he had reclused himself from the decision-making process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He insisted that the medical rescue service provided by Life Crisis was essential for MPB staff because of the dangerous nature of their jobs but said that his management would &quot;soon be assessing the desirability of taking a fresh look at the issue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray cited the &quot;replacement&quot; of the original, non-profit 'Section 21' Life Crisis company with a profit driven (Pty) Ltd operation, as the major reason for this reassessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Section 21 company was dissolved and replaced by Life Crisis Management Services (Pty) Ltd last year after Lowveld Helicopter Services brought an urgent liquidation order against it for outstanding accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before the liquidation order was served, all Life Crisis contracts and some of the Section 21 company's assets were transferred to Gray's new wholly- owned profit-driven company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His partners in the Section 21 company are still paying back more than R600 000 to the liquidators but because Gray didn't sign surety, he owed nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absa is, however, investigating Gray in connection with the alleged irregular transfer of funds between various bank accounts and the depositing of cheques. Other than confirming the investigation, Absa's Nelspruit office refused to comment on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the higher profile government contracts awarded to Lowveld Helicopter Services were repeated &quot;flips&quot; around the province by the now-disgraced former government consultant, Eugene Nyati, various trips by Premier Mathews Phosa, environment MEC David Mkhwanazi and colleagues, as well as site-seeing tours by various Dolphin Group executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lowveld Helicopter Services also flew a special MPB and Legislative delegation down to Parliament in Cape Town two weeks ago in a luxurious King Air fixed-wing plane and provided a helicopter to M-Net's Carte Blanche while they filmed an insert on Dolphin's deal with MPC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray however refused to say this week how much money MPB had spent to date with Lowveld Helicopter Services (LHS), insisting that this type of information could only be demanded by the provincial Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The MPB is not required to answer random enquiries about its detailed expenditure figures - but this should not be construed as the organisation not being publicly liable,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also refused to comment on the view that disclosing the expenditure was in public interest in light of his shareholding in LHS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lowveld Helicopter Service staff, however, suddenly stopped using the company's name when answering the phone this week and instead welcomed callers to &quot;Air Excellence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sales staff at the office, all Lowveld Helicopter Service's assets, staff, contracts and helicopters had simply been transferred to Air Excellence and &quot;business is continuing as usual&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray also refused to comment on a R3,5-million breach of contract law suite against LHS and against himself in person by the world's biggest private helicopter company - the Russian registered TyvmenAviaTrans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to regional TyvmenAviaTrans manager, Andre Denasov, the Russian company entered into a joint venture contract &quot;amazingly similar to the Dolphin deal&quot; with LHS in 1993 but by 1996 they were still allegedly owed over R2,2-million in profits and staff expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because Gray had drawn up the contract and designed the financial system, we didn't even have access to the joint venture's bank accounts or books,&quot; explained Denasov.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were smooth talked into this thing by Gray, who even offered setting us up as President Mandela's personal helicopter courier company, while selling the idea to us.&quot; Numerous other disgruntled former business associates of Gray also contracted M&amp;G, all with stories of how their companies had been liquidated by Gray, who allegedly walked away all the contracts and remaining assets of the various companies, while they were left with setting the debts.  Other companies in which Gray currently has interests include : Helicopter Investment Services, Eastern Transvaal Ambulance Services, Emergency Vehicle Hire Services, Corridor Management Services, Eagle Helicopters and Zambian Tours.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The Mozambican Consulate in Nelspruit is investigating setting up a formal enquiry into the death of a leading Maputo businesswoman who was allegedly refused admission in two Mpumalanga hospitals after an accident in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anna-Maria Mendez, the financial director of the Mozambican company, Brithol Michoma, died of her serious head injuries after doctors at Shongwe and Themba Hospitals turned her away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was finally admitted to a Private Hospital in Nelspruit ten hours after the accident but died shortly afterwards because doctors could not stabilise her condition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specialists who finally treated Mendez said on Wednesday that if they had seen her within three hours of the accident they would have been able to save her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police reports, 29-year-old Mendez and two companions were seriously injured in a head-on collision while on their way to Johannesburg from Maputo on Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the companions, Christo Todorob (26), died immediately after their vehicle collided with a heavily loaded truck just outside of Malelane. The truck was also a Mozambican registered vehicle which was returning to Maputo from Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendez, who sustained severe injuries to her head, and Rui Alegri were rushed to the nearby Shongwe Hospital, which reportedly refused to treat them and instead referred the two to the Themba Hospital in Kabokweni township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, after arriving at Themba, medical staff allegedly discovered that the two Mozambicans had medical aid and referred them to the Rob Ferreira Hospital 50km away in Nelspruit for &quot;better treatment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say that doctors at Rob Ferreira then decided the injuries would be better treated at Nelspruit's Private Hospital, &quot;especially since they had medical aid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendez and Alegri were finally admitted to the Private Hospital at 05h00 on Saturday morning - ten hours after the accident on Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendez died of her injuries shortly after being admitted. Alegri is still in the hospital's intensive care unit and is reported to be critical but stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shongwe Hospital spokesperson, Obert Ntimane, confirmed on Tuesday that Mendez and Alegri had been turned away because staff had thought that 'they will get better help' at Themba. Ntimane refused to say whether either patient had received any medication from hospital staff before being transferred to Themba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two patients were unknown and unconscious - in coma - when they arrived here. We have no specialists and so we decided it would be best to send them to Themba,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alegri's doctor, Dr Eric Der Wael, said on Wednesday that both Mendez and Alegri should have been sent directly to Nelspruit's Private Hospital for immediate treatment. &quot;The transfers were badly handled. With more time, we should have been able to do something for Mendez. The Private Hospital is the only medical institute in this part of Mpumalanga with a Computerised Tomogramme Machine which we need to revive the patient's brain,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But unfortunately there just wasn't anything we could do ten hours after the accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendez was buried in Maputo on Wednesday, where her family indicated that they would be laying official complaints.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The Mpumalanga Government, currently a target of international censure for mishandling its tourism assets, is drastically streamlining its environmental management to save over R400 000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Affairs MEC David Mkhwanazi said today this was the main reason reason for the shake-up in the three boards controlling the envrionment and tourism in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Membership of the restructured boards will be cut by more than half and restricted to Mpumalanga residents only.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change comes during a drastic revision of the highly controversial deal by which the province's Parks Board gave the foreign Dolphin Group virtually total commercial control of the province's tourist assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear if it will have any immediate effect on the Dolphin deal, which with proposed amendments is still being studied by the central government and by lawyers for the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Parks Board, a parastatal which triggered the controversy by negotiating the Dolphin deal, will be reduced from 18 to between five and eight members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The saving in allowances and travel costs will be about R105 000 a year.  Letters are being sent to present Parks Board members resident in Mpumalanga asking if they are prepared to continue serving on it and the new membership will be appointed from those who are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Environment Council has already been reduced from 23 members to five for an interim period. Chairman Dr Sue Hart has been reappointed and three of the other four will be from the Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF) who represent community interests, the South African Wildlife Society and the Lowveld Hunters' Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task of this interim committee will be to draft legislation defining the role of the Environment Council, which has not yet been formally created by the Mpumalanga legislature. Thereafter the interim committee will stand down and become available for reappointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The saving here would be R220 000 a year, Mr Mkhwanazi said. Much of the cost is in transport because a number of the former EC members came from outside Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mpumalanga Tourism Authority (MTA) will be cut from 13 to between five and eight members, saving R83 000. When Mr Mkhwanazi meets them today (Thursday) he will ask the new board to produce a plan by next month for a restructured, more effective way to promote tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes affect only the boards and not the environmental or tourism personnel staffs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The Mpumalanga capital of Nelspruit will be the first town in South Africa to get a fully fledged casino, when Tsogo Sun opens one of three approved provincial casino complexes in late September or October, said Mpumalanga Gaming Board chairman, Andre Wilsenach this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also revealed that up to five gambling machines would be permitted on licensed premises such as bars, taverns, clubs and restaurants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned, however, that the Nelspruit casino could be delayed or cancelled altogether if any valid objections or other hitches emerged during the remaining stages of the Board's exhaustive examination of the applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The successful applicants for the licence for a hotel-casino complex in the Lowveld region of Mpumalanga, one of four granted to the province, are Tsogo Sun Holdings. On the hotel side they are backed by Southern Sun and South African Breweries and on the casino operating side by MGM Grand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outlining in detail his Board's work to the Sakekamer in Nelspruit, Mr Wilsenach was asked how the community could be protected from the effects of a casino and replied there was no simple, straightforward answer to this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board and casino operators would be responsible for keeping children and compulsive gamblers away and maintaining high standards. It was a complex social problem but public attitudes were changing to accept gambling as a form of entertainment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Wilsenach said licensed premises like clubs, bars and restaurants - but not cafes, supermarkets or other places frequented by minors - would be allowed to have up to five gaming machines for entertainment only, paying a maximum prize each of R500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About the Nelspruit casino he remarked: &quot;We have had excellent co-operation from business so far ... they have all objected to it. But this is constructive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining the Board's operation he said Mpumalanga was granted one casino licence each for the Northern Highveld, Southern Highveld, Lowveld and Escarpment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board received applications from 35 parties who were asked to submit proposals and the R200 000 fee each. Fifteen did and after checking their financial standing and experience in the gaming industry, nine finalists were selected: four in the Lowveld, three in the Northern Highveld and two in the Southern Highveld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were asked to put up full proposals for a hotel-casino complex with entertainment, restaurants, bars and other amenities and details of staff, revenue, ability to handle large sums of money, land rights, technical competence and their economic contribution to the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board was seeking a world class casino which would create extra bed- nights in the province and induce Kruger National Park visitors to spend more time in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsogo Sun Holdings came out on top. The Southern Sun hotel group was probably the largest in the southern hemisphere and MGM Grand were one of the world's largest casino operators, who ran the new &quot;New York New York&quot; casino in Las Vegas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Wilsenach said that under American law, if MGM Grand committed any offence here or anywhere else in the world, it would lose its US licence, which was a powerful inducement to efficient management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Nelspruit licence had not yet been finally granted. The Board was still examining in fine detail Tsogo Sun and the backgrounds of its directors, shareholders and employees &quot;so we do not have the Mafia involved, which you will understand is quite important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsogo Sun's entire project was still open to 30-day public scrutiny which would end on Sunday, March 16. After that Tsogo Sun would have to respond to objections and inquiries and only then, it the Board were satisfied, would they grant a temporary licence to allow the group to operate while they built their project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The temporary licence could be from September or October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Wilsenach said Nelspruit was the best site for a casino because it had the most disposable income. The site was inside the municipal area but not close to schools, churches, old age homes and the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hotel would be separate from the casino beside the Crocodile River next to the National Botanical Gardens, second only in South Africa to Kirstenbosch, where various facilities like aviaries and butterfly shelters would be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The casino would be nearby and coupled to a retail shopping complex which, experience had shown at 80 similar casino sites elsewhere in the world, was a good way of attracting custom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, the choice of site was the developer's: &quot;We don't believe government has the necessary information to understand sufficiently the market mechanism and prescribe that it should be here or there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A casino at Hazyview would be inappropriate because it would be on the doorstep of a large impoverished community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, money is important. This is a mechanism which can generate revenue and the money must be ploughed back into the communities. I don't think the intention is to create a gambling nation but to use this activity as a means to an end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board would have an office and staff in every casino in the province to monitor its activities and guarantee standards were maintained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Zairean rebels captured Kisangani - Zaire's third largest city - on Saturday, the biggest prize in their five-month offensive. Rebel radio &quot; Voice of the People&quot; reported on Saturday that the city had been taken after five hours of fierce fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, the radio had reported the capture of the international airport, some 17 kilometres away from the city. CNN said that sources in Kinsangani reported Zairean soldiers retreated from the front on Friday night saying that &quot;it's all finished, it's all lost&quot;. The rebels were reported to have been led by the 25-year-old son of Laurent-Desire Kabila, leader of the rebel group, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire (ADFL). Captain Ndjoli Esenge Akeli, legal adviser for the Zaire military, said that mercenaries holding the international airport tried to make the Zairean troops hold their ground and a fire fight had ensued. There were many deaths, he said. By dawn on Saturday most Zairean troops had fled during the night and those who remained were looting the city. Armaments were reportedly looted and mines planted in the forests surrounding the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An AFP correspondent in Kisangani said that many of the Government troops left on skiffs across the river while Serb mercenaries took off in helicopters they had earlier used to bombard rebel positions. The Governor of Upper Zaire and large numbers of civilians are also reported to have fled.  Some 15 expatriates, including French nationals, aid workers and two AFP journalists, were evacuated by a French military plane to Bangui in Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A westerner in Kisangani told AFP by telephone on Saturday that the rebels entered the city to &quot;shouts of joy&quot; from the remaining 500,000 residents. No shots were fired in the city centre. Kinshasa was reported to be calm yesterday but the government has remained silent regarding the fate of Kisangani. Sources in Kinshasa said that the fall of Kisangani, a major transport hub on the Zaire River and capital of the diamond rich Upper Zaire, is a major blow to the government's counter-offensive and to the regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko. Mobutu, who has prostate cancer, was readmitted to hospital in Monaco yesterday, although aides had earlier said that he may return to Zaire today. Analysts predict that the fall of Kisangani could be a fatal blow to Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo who only on Wednesday vowed that the city would not fall, and will probably erode what support Mobutu has left.  Some military observers say that with the capture of Kisangani the balance of the civil war would shift to Laurent-Desire Kabila. Others believe that Kabila's forces would meet with stiffer resistence if they move outside eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed Sahnoun, Joint UN/OAU Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region met with Kabila for three and a half hours in Goma on Saturday and briefed the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan on the outcome of the talks. UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said that Kabila had reaffirmed his acceptance of the UN's five point peace-plan, but rejected a cease-fire and wanted face to face talks with Kinshasa. Kabila told journalists in Goma on Saturday that his forces would push &quot;as far as Kinshasa&quot; and called on President Mobutu to step down. The five point peace plan, which has the support of the UN Security Council, calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of foreign forces and mercenaries, negotiations, elections and the protection of refugees. On Sunday, rebel leaders said that if Kinshasa refused to negotiate, their next target was Lubumbashi, capital of the mineral-rich province of Shaba in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* At a press conference in Goma on Saturday, Kabila repeated his accusation that there were some 2,000 UNITA troops (former members of Jonas Savimbi's Angolan guerrilla forces) fighting alongside Zairean soldiers. He also claimed that there were some 3,000 ex-FAR (former Rwandan government forces) and a command structure of French officers. Both Angola and France have denied official involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In France, Prime Minister Alain Juppe repeated his plea for a multi- national force to save as many as 400,000 Rwandan and Burundi refugees who have been caught up in the fighting. Both the US government and Britain had rejected the plea last week, but at the weekend a spokesman for the US government said that &quot;the door was still open&quot;. Juppe also accused the rebels of massacring Hutus and said that forces of neighbouring countries had invaded &quot;to help the rebels and destablise the country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* President Daniel arap Moi said on Saturday that he expected Mobutu or one of his representatives to attend a regional summit in Nairobi scheduled Wednesday and Thursday to discuss the crisis in Zaire. The meeting will prepare the way for a wider &quot;Nairobi III&quot; summit - a follow-up to two earlier summits in the Kenyan capital - at a later date. Invitations to next week's meeting have been sent to presidents Mobutu, Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Paul Biya of Cameroon and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Mandela has said that he will not attend the summit but would send an official to represent him.  Today's Kenyan newspaper, the Daily Nation, reports that opposition groups have urged Moi to invite Kabila to the talks. Moi has previously rejected similar proposals. Another summit on Zaire is due to be held on 25/26 March in Lome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Relief agencies were standing by yesterday for the green light from rebels and the Zaire government to restart aid flights to Kisangani. WFP suspended relief flights to the city - its base for food delivery to refugees in Ubundu, some 100 kms to the south - on Saturday but had been planning to send in an Ilyushin cargo plane twice a day to feed the more than 100,000 refugees who are gathered in Ubundu. Many of the refugees are continuing to try to cross to the west bank of the Zaire river; some 10,000 are reported to have succeeded. As many as 300 have drowned in the river.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - As rebels continued their advance across Zaire, the streets of Kinshasa, the capital of Zaire, were rife with rumours today concerning the health of President Mobutu Sese Seko and a possible coup attempt by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some newspapers are quoted as saying that Mobutu is seriously ill, or dying.  According to local businessmen in Kinshasa, rumours of a coup have been circulating since yesterday following a series of meetings between top Zairean generals. Later-night army movements and unexplained automatic fire overnight in the Limete section of the capital on Sunday have compounded doubts about the security of the city. The Zairean Government has dismissed rumours but despite reassurances, sources in Kinshasa say that tension continued to rise throughout the day and that &quot;wild rumours&quot; have persisted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mobutu, 66, was operated on for prostate cancer in August last year.  Sources close to Mobutu's family told IRIN that he returned to Europe for a scheduled check-up but was unexpectedly admitted to hospital. A spokesman for Mobutu, Gad Cohen, denied that Mobutu was in serious condition and said that he could be released from hospital as early as today. Mobutu's son, Mobutu Nzanga, told AFP in Monaco that his father would return home very soon to &quot; settle the crisis&quot;, but no departure date was given. Mobutu, who has held power in Zaire for more than three decades, has visited France three times for follow-up treatment since his operation. Aides said that Mobutu had telephoned his Cabinet twice yesterday from his hospital bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in Kinshasa say that since the rebel take-over of Kisangani - Zaire's third largest city - at the weekend, the movement of people out of the capital has accelerated. Many people, including high-level government members and their families, military officers and members of Mobutu's family, are reported to be leaving Kinshasa via ferries across the Zaire River to Brazzaville, the capital of neighbouring Congo. A Congolese Red Cross official confirmed to AFP today that members of Mobutu's family had arrived.  All international flights are fully booked. Many Europeans have laid siege to the head offices of airlines and travel agencies since Monday morning, while others are reported to have rushed to the shops to &quot;stock up&quot;. Some foreign shop owners have boarded their stores to prevent looting. The French government told AFP yesterday that it has no plans to evacuate its citizens from Kinshasa. Other European Embassies have also not issued evacuation orders, but have advised caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaetan Kakudji, ADFL foreign affairs spokesman, declared on Monday that Mobutu no longer ruled the country and that the way lay open for them to move on to Kinshasa. The government has not yet confirmed the fall of Kisangani but issued a statement after an unscheduled cabinet meeting yesterday saying that Kisangani had been attacked by &quot;heavily armed regular units of the Ugandan Army, equipped with sophiscated weapons&quot;. Uganda has repeatedly denied charges that it was supporting the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Kisangani, some 300 Zairean government troops handed their weapons over to the ADFL on Monday. Reuters reports that the soldiers will be &quot;re- educated and retrained&quot; by the ADFL. One Zairean soldier is reported to have said &quot;We want change. Why flee?&quot; Reports from Kisangani indicate that the city is calm and life is swiftly returning to normal. Kabila's 25-year-old son Joseph who led the rebels into the city is said to have stopped looting of the city within hours of taking it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* As rebels advance through Shaba towards Kasai, &quot;Le Soft&quot; newspaper reports that Jonas Muamba Kadiata Nzemba, the head of Kasai mineral giant, MIBA, has declared that he would cooperate with Kabila &quot;if he comes here&quot;.  MIBA is believed to be a major source of financing for Mobutu. Its possible fall into rebel hands, coupled with the previous losses of SOMINKI in Maniema and Kilo Mota in Haut Zaire, would present a significant financial blow to Mobutu. Gecamines in Shaba is the only remaining mineral giant of any significance in government held territory. Analysts say that Nzemba's announcement carries weight both with regard to the economic importance of MIBA and because of his own political stature. Nzemba has been a long time member of the MRP and at times has been closely associated with Zairean opposition leader, Etienne Tshisekedi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Paris, Zairean Foreign Minister, Kamanda wa Kamanda said yesterday that the capture of Kisangani by the ADFL could lead to a partitioning of the country. In a communique to AFP, the Foreign Minister said that the capture of Kisangani &quot;with the support of foreign troops&quot; carries the &quot;seeds and the risks&quot; of the partition of Zaire &quot;on the 25th parallel&quot; stretching from Kisangani to Kamina in Shaba. Kamanda accused the European Union and the United Nations of having abandoned Zaire and failing to put pressure on Kabila to observe a UN peace plan, including a cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, the only western country still supporting the Zairean government, has continued to press for a cease-fire. Speaking on French radio, Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said yesterday that the first step in the beginning of a settlement is that the cease-fire is also accepted by Kabila.  The government of Zaire agreed last month to a cease-fire under the UN five- point peace plan. Analysts say that the fall of Kisagani confirms that France backed the wrong side and criticised the country's &quot;blind support for Mobutu&quot;.  Kabila warned France today against intervening militarily in Zaire to prop up Mobutu. He told a rally in Goma that he believed the French government wanted to replace Mobutu &quot;with his cronies&quot; and that it would approve a coup d'etat in Kinshasa. Kabila added that if there was a coup, the war would go on. US Assistant Secretary of State for African affairs, George Moose was scheduled to hold talks today with Charette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Members of the UN Security Council on Monday urged all parties to the conflict in Zaire to allow humanitarian access to as many as 400,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees trapped by fighting or hiding in the forests. The call followed a closed door briefing of the Security Council by senior UN official Ibrahima Fall. AFP said that Fall told the Council that Kabila had promised Mohamed Sahnoun, Joint UN/OAU Special Representative for the Great Lakes, access to refugees in rebel held territory. The Council reaffirmed support for Sahnoun's peace mission and for the regional mini-summit to be held on Wednesday in Nairobi. The Council also called on rebels and government to comply with the UN peace plan. Kabila, who has repeatedly said that face to face negotiations with Kinshasa must take place before he will agree to a cease-fire, announced a seven-day unilateral cease-fire around Kisangani today to facilitate relief operations and repatriation. AFP reports that Kabila said that the cease-fire would take effect within a radius of 20 kms outside Kisangani but that the offensive would continue in other parts of the country. &quot;There is no cease-fire in Shaba, nor in Kasai&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Aid agencies said today that they are continuing to wait for the green light from the ADFL to resume operations in Kisangani. Prior to the rebel take-over, looters emptied one of the World Food Programme's two warehouses in the city, but left limited stocks in the other. Other agency warehouses were also looted. A spokeswoman for WFP said that stocks in the warehouses were low due to disruption in deliveries in March. WFP, as other agencies, was using Kisangani as a hub to feed some 85,000 refugees in Ubundu, 100 km to the south of Kisangani. Relief distributions to some 35,000 displaced persons living with families, in hospitals and a few makeshift centres in Kisangani were also being undertaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Some 15,000 refugees are reported to have crossed the Zaire river into Ubundu town on the west bank. More are attempting to cross despite the risk of drowning. Another 50,000 refugees are reported to be on the road heading towards the river. Local authorities have agreed to set up a site for the refugees on the west side outside Ubundu town, but refugee leaders have said that they want to move on to Opala, 200 kms west of Ubundu. If they do, aid workers say that it will be virtually impossible to reach them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Human Rights Watch has appealed to officials of the US, EU, UN and OAU to redouble efforts to protect the &quot;tens of thousands of noncombattant refugees&quot; caught up in the fighting. The organisation says that the refugees face attack by the ADFL and that information collected by Human Rights Watch and from other sources indicate that ADFL forces and ex-FAR have slaughtered unarmed civilians. The organisation has called for a &quot;prompt and thorough investigation of charges of massive killings of civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law in eastern Zaire&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNHCR, in collaboration with WFP and UNICEF, began on Monday an evacuation of unaccompanied children from Tingi-Tingi and Amisi. A WFP plane airlifted 16 malnourished children to Goma where they will be accommodated before being placed with families in Rwanda. Two other children died before they could be flown out of Tingi-Tingi. More flights are planned. About 1,000 refugees, mostly too weak or too sick to travel, have remained in Tingi-Tingi and a further 1,200 refugees are in Amisi. Tingi-Tingi housed up to 160,000 refugees prior to the rebel advance. UN and other aid agencies have been flying daily into Tingi-Tingi and Amisi from Goma. Sources reported three flights today into both locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives from WFP, UNHCR, UNICEF, MSF and Oxfam flew into Kalima and Kindu yesterday. In Kindu they found about 200 unaccompanied children. A trip to Shabunda had to be called off because the airstrip was waterlogged. Daily flights are planned into Kindu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* South Africa's Deputy President, Thabo Mbeki, will attend Wednesday's mini-summit of African heads of state in Nairobi on the conflict in Zaire, but diplomatic sources say that a breakthrough was unlikely without ADFL attendance. Sources in Cape Town said yesterday that Mbeki will stand in for President Nelson Mandela whose workload has been lightened ahead of a State visit to India and Bangladesh. Mandela met with Kabila and a representative of the Zairean government in South Africa last month. At the weekend, presidential aide, Parks Mankahlana denied that Mandela's absence could be perceived as an acknowledgement that his mediation efforts had failed. The Zairean crisis was not the presidential's personal responsibility but &quot;the whole of Africa's&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo is expected to be present, along with the presidents of Zimbabwe, Cameroon and Tanzania. OAU Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim will also attend, along with Mohamed Sahnoun. Zaire was not represented at the two previous regional summits. The latest meeting is a followup to the second Nairobi summit in February at which the presidents of Kenya, South Africa, Cameroon and Zimbabwe were mandated to seek a solution to the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim told AFP upon his arrival in Kenya today that the summit will look at mechanisms to end civil war in Zaire, for starting negotiations and monitoring a cease-fire. Salim said that any initiative coming from the summit would depend on briefings by Sahnoun on his recent meetings with Kabila. In Goma, Kabila said that he expected &quot;nothing to emerge&quot; from the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Benjamin Mkapa, President of Tanzania and Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe have been holding private talks in the Zimbabwe capital of Harare.  Although no details have been released, Radio Tanzania's External Service reported yesterday that the two leaders are believed to have discussed matters affecting their nations and the latest developments in central Africa, with particular attention to the situation in Zaire. Mr Mkapa is also believed to be lobbying for Salim in his bid for a third term as Secretary- General of the OAU. Salim is a former Tanzanian prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Two soldiers and 50 rebels were reported killed in fighting on Friday near the Burundi capital of Bujumbura. Burundi Army spokesman, Isaie Nibizi said that the Army seized 13 light weapons during the fighting in Muhuta area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Burundian minister of interior and public security, Lt-Col Epitace Bayaganakandi, has released a list of eight people already arrested for their implication in the assassination plot against the head of state. BBC Monitoring reports that the Burundi radio quoted Minister Bayaganakandi as saying that the plot and the anti-tank mines planted on Wednesday night (12th March) were the work of one and the same group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Burundian radio, monitored by BBC, the following people have been arrested: Isaac Nitereka, member of the board of directors of Parena (National Recovery Party) party who was also its representative in urban Bujumbura; Laurent Bimenyumuremyi, deputy provincial representative of Parena in Gitega; Isidore Rufyikiri, in charge of ideology and propaganda for the Parena party; Lt-Col (retd) Pascal Ntako, in charge of security affairs in Parena; Alexis (?Bibavimbere), Parena member; Capt Protais Nzeyimana, army officer still serving at the Mwaro (?reserve) battalion (western Burundi); Cpl (name indistinct) (?Nizigiyimana) still serving at the Bururi (southern Burundi) military barracks; and finally, Paul Mugambage, who deserted from the Rwandan Patriotic Army in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The trial of three genocide suspects began yesterday in the International Criminal Tribunal sitting in Arusha yesterday. The three suspects - Clement Kayishema, Obed Ruzindana and Gerard Ntakirutimana - are accused of genocide and other crimes against humanity in Kibuye Prefecture. The case was adjourned. The trial of George Rutaganda, the vice-president of the Interahamwe is scheduled to begin today after a two week delay to facilitate location of 16 defence witnesses. The witnesses had been based in Tingi-Tingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A refugee spokesman told the Inter Press Service news agency that 200 Zairean refugees living in Khartoum and southern Sudan had asked UNHCR to repatriate them to eastern Zaire. According to Sudanese officials there are some 120,000 Zairean refugees in the country. A UNHCR official in Khartoum said that no official request for repatriation had been received by his office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Uganda's New Vision newspaper today reports that thousands of Sudanese refugees have left Uganda and arrived in Kaya, a border town in southern Sudan which fell to the SPLA during the weekend of 8/9 March. The paper reports that the refugees lined the road from Koboko in Uganda across the border to the town, both young and old, bringing goats, dogs and heavy loads.  Uganda is home to an estimated 200,000 Sudanese refugees, most of whom are in Arua and Moyo districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The death of Colonel Juma Oris, commander of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), reported in Uganda's Sunday Monitor newspaper, has yet to be confirmed. Today's Monitor reports that both the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) and the WNBF are searching for his body. The Sunday Moniter reported that the UPDF killed Oris on Saturday morning in fighting close to the Uganda-Sudan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Tanzania has refuted allegations by relief agencies that it was blocking humanitarian cargo destined for Burundi. Agencies said that in spite of special exemptions to the economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by neighbouring states in July last year, goods were being held up. Tanzania's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakaya Kikwete told a press conference late last week that this was not the case and said that it appeared the issue &quot;is being used as a political weapon to pressure countries to lift the sanctions&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Human Rights Watch today (March 14, 1997) called upon Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Chair of the EU Presidency and Dutch Foreign Minister H.A.F.M.O. van Mierlo, Secretary-General Kofi Annan, U.N. and OAU Special Envoy Ambassador Mahmoud Sahnoun, and OAU Secretary-General Salim A.  Salim to redouble their efforts to protect the tens of thousands of noncombatant refugees, many of them women and children, caught in the Zairean war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees, the rest of some one million Hutu who fled Rwanda after the defeat of the genocidal government in 1994, are facing attack by the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) that drove them from camps in eastern Zaire several months ago. The international human rights organization also insisted on a prompt and thorough investigation of charges of massive killings of civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Mozambique's economy showed that it was on the path of recovery with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing at about 6 percent in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing this in his state-of-the nation address to parliament in Maputo Monday, President Joachim Chissano said there was also a 24 percent leap in commodity exports while inflation declined from 54 percent in 1995 to 16.6 percent last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other &quot;tangible advances&quot;, Chissano said, included the low depreciation rate of the national currency, the metical, by only 5 percent during the past year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributed the success to government's continued austerity policy to strictly control public expenditure, thus allowing the banks to make credit available for the private sector &quot;without producing inflationary pressures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chissano, 1996 was &quot;a year rich in political, economic and social achievements.&quot; He told the Assembly of the Republic that living conditions were gradually improving, as indicated by statistics showing an increase in life expectancy, an increase in the number of schools functioning, and an expansion in the health network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President said, however, that about 400,000 Mozambicans had been affected by the recent flooding in the Pungue, Buzi and Zambezia river valleys. The floods had forced about 20,000 Mozambicans into exile in Malawi and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the two worst affected provinces, Sofala and Tete, preliminary estimates were that 173,000 hectares of crops had been lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the flood victims have lost all their means of survival,&quot; said Chissano, adding that &quot; efforts are under way to guarantee a three months food supply to the 125,000 people worst affected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said with the rescue operations in flood-stricken areas now over, the top priority was &quot;to normalize the life of the population, guaranteeing the supply of food and other necessities, and the rebuilding of their homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano told parliament that Mozambique also had an excellent harvest in 1996, which &quot;has helped reduce dependence on imported grain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, expressed concern at the alarming rise in crime last year. &quot; Our police has faced criminals working with modern and sophisticated equipment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some policemen have succumbed to bribes and some have even worked hand-in- hand with criminals. A lot still needs to be done to make our police a credible force.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The strike by Air Zimbabwe pilots and flight engineers entered its fourth day Monday with passengers continuing to be inconvenienced by disrupted flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far there has been no progress on the strike and the team comprising members of the airline's management and striking pilots and flight engineers has not been set up yet,&quot; Davis Mwenga said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwenga, the airline's public relations manager, said that the four aircraft leased from Nationwide of South Africa continued to carry passengers to most of the local and regional destinations. The London flight has remained cancelled since the strike started Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are still flying passengers and one of our planes is still in use, using contract pilots,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leased aircraft were covering destinations such as Lusaka, Johannesburg, Victoria Falls, Hwange and Kariba. Inconvenienced passengers to London were being booked on other airlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike comes after several months of negotiations between the pilots and management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The estimated 70 pilots and flight engineers are demanding higher salaries and perks which compare favorably with those of other airlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are reportedly demanding an annual salary of about 350,000 zimdollars (31,818 U.S. dollars), excluding allowances for captains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management has said that, at this stage, it could not afford the increments due to the low profits the airline has made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline, with a fleet of nine aircraft, employs some 2,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other passengers to domestic destinations were being booked with the Zimbabwe Express Airlines, the country's only private airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are trying to move passengers as much as possible but we are acknowledging the fact that we have inconvenienced passengers and we apologize for that,&quot; Mwenga said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Hillary Clinton, the wife of the United States president Bill Clinton, arrived in Dakar, Senegal, Monday, on the first leg of a six-nation African tour to promote democracy and civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was initially due to arrive Saturday but was delayed by the brief hospitalization of President Bill Clinton, who underwent knee surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton is accompanied by ranking U.S. officials, and her 17-year old daughter, Chelsea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Moose, former U.S. ambassador to Senegal and now the deputy secretary of state for African affairs is also on Clinton's entourage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement to the media, Clinton said she was determined to strengthen the already good relations between Dakar and Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My visit to the village of Saam Ndaye and the United States Peace Peace Corps Training Center will give me the opportunity to see how to work, hand in hand, towards the development of relations between the two countries,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former slave island of Goree, some three kilometres from Dakar, in the Atlantic Ocean, was, she said, &quot;a symbol of the historical relations between our two nations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also, she said, &quot;reminiscent of the horrendous memories of slavery but constitutes at the same time a testimony of the force of human spirit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;The United States of America has benefited from the genius of men coming from the African continent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Senegal had maintained a &quot;strong and vibrant&quot; democratic tradition and had been active in peacekeeping and conflict settlement operations around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton is scheduled to meet Senegalese President Abdou Diouf today and later visit Goree island, where she will be shown the women's museum and the house of slaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She will also visit in the Peace Corps training facility Saam Ndaye, in the Region of Thies, 80 km (50 miles) East of Dakar. Then, she will tour U.S-.  sponsored development projects on democratic institutions and the education of African woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Senegal, she will fly to South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Uganda and Eritrea for similar tours.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Private airlines operating in Nigeria have increased fares on domestic routes by 100 percent after government rejected a 200-per cent hike they proposed a month ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no official announcement, but a check at the Lagos airport showed that two major private airlines, the Aviation Development Company (ADC), and Bellview Airlines began implementing the new air fares Sunday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their officials said they had government approval for the increase, which aviation sources said was meant to come into effect Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers expressed surprise at the increase, saying the government should have given the public at least one-month notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new rates, a one-way ticket from Lagos to Abuja INL002 from SSS.  064 (970317-17:52) QN PANAINL .PANADKR MSG063G/02E PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PAN(2) jumped from 2,925 naira to 6,150 naira (80 naira = 1USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rates include five percent Value Added Tax on the tickets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Airline Operators Association of Nigeria had been campaigning for the hike, because of high aircraft running costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operators had planned a unilateral fare hike of 200 percent last month, but were forced to abandon the plan after the aviation ministry threatened to ground their planes, if they implemented the hike.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - At least 21 countries and 100 multinational companies are participating in the 7th All- Africa Trade and Tourism Fair taking place in Nigeria's northern city of Kaduna, March 29 to April 6, Nigerian commerce and tourism minister, Rear Admiral Jubrila Ayinla announced in Lagos Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister told a monthly forum organized by the Pan- African News Agency (PANA) and the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), that facilities were in place for the fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that egypt was among countries already putting finishing touches to their stands at the fair pavilion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayinla, a member of Nigeria's ruling Provisional Military Council said the fair to be opened by Nigerian head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha &quot;is to provide a forum for the exchange and dissemination of information on intra-African trade.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to official figures, recorded total intra-African trade is put as low as 10 percent, while the greater percentage of business transactions remain unrecorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In spite of the vast potentials and great possibilities that exist for fostering intra-African trade to the mutual benefit of all member-states, the sector is not having the desired impact on economic development in the continent,&quot; the minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said, these potentials &quot;can be immediately developed by concerted efforts to exchange facts, ideas and existing resources through an appropriate forum like the one provided by the all-Africa trade fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayinla said the fair approved and supported by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), was part of efforts to boost continental integration under the African Economic Community, whose treaty was signed in Abuja in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fair is in line with the permanent 'buy African goods' campaign within the framework of the Lagos Plan of Action,&quot; the minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the national level, he said &quot;the fair provides Nigeria with the opportunity to package and showcase her enormous potentials as well as demonstrate our well-acknowledged hospitality to the African business community and its partners all over the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayinla, commandant of Nigeria's National War College for two years before he was appointed minister in July 1996, said the emergent trend in the world today dictated that &quot;political problems in Africa can best be tackled through improved economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no alternative than to cooperate, otherwise we will continue to depend on donor-nations, he said, adding that Africans should strive to dismantle &quot;the artificial barriers of history and colonialism,&quot; that tended to keep the continent perpetually marginalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the unfavorable developments in the multilateral trading system and the emerging trends of globalization and liberalization of the world economy, Africa is presently faced with the serious challenges of marginalization,&quot; the minister added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was no reason for instance, why other West African countries should be buying Peugeot cars from Europe, when Nigeria had a Peugeot assembly plant, or why Africans should troupe to Europe yearly on holidays, while tourism resorts abound on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian minister said in spite of political differences between Abuja and Pretoria over democracy and human rights issues, &quot;South Africa will be one of the largest exhibitors&quot; at the Kaduna fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa should form its own free trade area,&quot; he said, &quot;to explore the abundant resources god has given us. Let goods and services flow freely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 65th OAU ministerial council session held last month in Tripoli, Libya, urged all members countries to effectively participate at the fair, which has the theme: &quot;Promote Africa's Development -- Buy African Goods --Tour Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fair is divided into three components: a buyer-seller forum, an investment platform and a tourism segment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally scheduled to take place in Lagos in November 1996, it was postponed and relocated to Kaduna because of what Nigerian officials called logistic reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 6th African trade fair was held in 1992 in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations (PANA) - Conflict resolution will dominate the agenda of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, when he makes his first official trip to Africa this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political conflicts have succeeded one another on the African continent, more than 30 years since most of its countries won their flag independence.  These range from the six-month-old rebellion in eastern Zaire to the decades- old civil war in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since he assumed office in January, Kofi Annan has consistently said that the resolution of the conflicts was a necessity if africa is to attain the much-needed social and economic stability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, Annan wants africa to take the lead in efforts to resolve the conflicts in its domain, in line with the trend in other regions of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To illustrate this point, the Ghanaian said recently that: &quot;when we look at the peace-keeping operations around the world, there is a strong regional dimension to it.&quot; He was speaking in a recent interview ahead of the African trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Bosnia, it was the European countries...France and Britain and others...  who underpinned the operation, (and) in Cambodia, the Asian countries played a very important role even though troops from other regions joined them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Africa has to be able to organize itself to play its part even if it is a UN operation and other governments are going to join in...this is a message I have repeated and I intend to get across,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General has chosen an appropriate forum -- the summit of the Organisation of African Unity's central organ for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Lome, Togo, later this month -- to deliver the message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before attending the summit in Lome, Annan will travel first to South Africa to confer with President Nelson Mandela and other officials. Mandela has been making efforts to bring about a negotiated solution to the conflict in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan will meet Mandela a few days after the seizure of Kisangani, Zaire's third largest city, by rebels of Laurent Desire Kabila's Democratic Alliance for the Liberation of Congo/Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His other stops in the 11-day trip are Namibia, for a meeting with President Sam Nujoma, and Angola, to give a final push for a peaceful end to the internecine conflict that has ravaged the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Angola, Annan is to hold separate meetings with President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos and the UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi. The former guerilla leader has been reluctant to join a national unity government and this has impeded the full implementation of the Lusaka peace accord his movement signed with the Luanda government on Nov. 20, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Annan's intention is to use the March 26-27 Lome summit to make a pitch for urgent action in the continent's most-desperate conflict today, in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His message to leaders in Lome will be that African countries must be part of any multinational force that might be sent there to help the thousands of Rwandan refugees who have been forced out of their camps by the fighting, between the rebels and the government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That proposal, backed by France, has been repulsed by other United Nations Security Council members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I definitely intend to talk to the African heads of state about effective participation in any force that may be put on the ground in eastern Zaire,&quot; he said. He revealed that Egypt, Ethiopia and Tanzania had offered to participate in the proposed force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, the Secretary-General's repeated calls for the deployment of a multinational force to help the refugees, many of whom have died of hunger and diseases while foraging in the forest, has met with a tepid response.  Only France, of the western countries with the capability to provide logistic, material and financial support for such a force, has backed the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps a stronger indication, by African countries, of the intention to be involved in any proposed plan to end the crisis may galvanize support for the Secretary-General's call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan's trans-atlantic trip, which will last from March 18 to March 28, may well be worth it if it can provide the continent with the badly-needed tonic for self-help.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the meeting of the Secretary-general with the Sahrawi representatives M'hamad Khaddad and Achmed Boukhari, the Polisario Front has expressed readiness to cooperate with the UN Secretary-general in efforts to eliminate the inaction preventing the implementation of the peace plan in Western Sahara.

He said Polisario was trying to restrict the right of Sahrawis to participate in the referendum &quot;by limiting that right to persons whose names appear in the Spanish census of 1974, a census whose omissions and flaws have been acknowleged by all forums.&quot; Snoussi claimed that, &quot;while Morocco remains committed to the settlement plan, the other party is doing its utmost to delay the referendum process and even prevent it from taking place.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - INTRODUCTION: 1. This report follows two recent DHA/IRIN field trips to Uganda and describes developments affecting the humanitarian situation during January and February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first section of the report describes the current situation in Kitgum, Gulu, Arua and Kasese districts. Part two reviews the changing situation along Uganda's borders with Zaire and Sudan and looks at relations between Uganda and its neighbours. The report concludes by discussing the prospects for an improvement in the humanitarian situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Readers are encouraged to read this report in conjunction with IRIN's Humanitarian Situation Report of 4 December 1996, which provides an overview of the situation in Uganda. Readers are asked to note that this report focusses on the complex emergencies in Uganda and does not discuss Uganda's general food security problems, which have been the subject of a recent Government of Uganda emergency appeal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE CURRENT SITUATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kitgum District</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In mid-January a group of Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels launched a series of attacks on Kitgum's civilian population, leaving an estimated 312 people dead and 60,000 people displaced from their homes (1). The attacks took place in the north of the district, close to Uganda's border with Sudan, primarily in and around the villages of Lokung, Palabek and Padibe. According to reports from people displaced by the violence, the LRA entered their villages and distributed leaflets telling them to leave for Kitgum town. The rebels then attacked village residents with axes and clubs and set ablaze their houses and granaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Families fled in terror towards Kitgum town, along with injured people who had managed to escape. A number of people with deep head wounds and other injuries are currently being treated in Kitgum hospital. According to estimates compiled by the local authorities and provided by AVSI, the Italian NGO, there are some 12,113 displaced persons at the public school in Kitgum and another 4,669 at a hill top in the town. In and around the villages themselves, there are an estimated 22,140 displaced people at Palabek, 11,941 at Lokung, 4,062 at Padibe and 6,987 at Atanga (2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The health of the displaced persons, crowded into the temporary sites, is a matter of growing concern. There are reports of about 100 cholera cases in Palabek, Padibe and Hill Top camps and of measles cases in Palabek, Attange and Gandyang, a newly-established camp. Water and sanitation is reported to be poor, especially in Palabek and Lokung. The displaced persons are currently being assisted by the Government of Uganda and UN agencies and NGOs which are scaling up their programmes. They include WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR, AVSI, OXFAM, CRS, MSF and World Vision. Relief activities within the district are coordinated by the Kitgum Disaster Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The LRA's attacks, which continued into February, and the large-scale displacement they caused, took the district completely by surprise, as Kitgum had until January enjoyed far better security than Gulu district, its westerly neighbour. Kitgum, reported to be the LRA's transit point into and out of Sudan, has experienced attacks and abductions in the past, but the present scale of violence is without precedent. John Bosco Oryem, Kitgum council chairman, said that 'the January attack was a new development' because 'normally the rebels pass through the district and abduct in small numbers... (b)ut this time they killed and the numbers were enormous.' (3)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The attacks have prompted debate within Uganda as to the reasons for the current series of LRA atrocities. According to the accounts of former abductees reported in the national press, the LRA is avenging the population of Kitgum for its alleged cooperation with the Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF), and for the reportedly high levels of desertion from the LRA of rebels originating from the district. It also appears that the rebels may be seeking to displace populations in order to establish bases within Kitgum and points where they can deposit arms. This seems to be confirmed by national press reports of the UPDF discovering arms caches in Kitgum, including ammunition near Palabek and 29 anti-tank mines found near Lokung.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gulu District</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Insecurity has become a major fact of life for most of Gulu's population in recent years, and during January a series of attacks in Gulu town's suburbs highlighted the vulnerability of civilian populations to the LRA's campaign of terror. According to reports from the government-owned New Vision newspaper, attacks in the suburbs of Gulu town left 12 people dead during the weekend of 4/5 January and 14 dead on 18 January . The killings in the countryside continued during January; among the incidents reported was the 15 January killing of an estimated 26 people in villages around the River Olik, about 15 miles north-west of Gulu town. Military engagements between the LRA and the UPDF were also reported during January and February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Every evening, about 13,000 people enter Gulu town from neighbouring villages to spend the night in the town for their own protection (4).  Meanwhile, around Gulu district as a whole, most of the district's population of 390,000 people are now living in so-called 'protected villages'. According to figures from the local authorities, there are now 281,000 people living in 15 such sites around the district, a figure which includes resident populations and the displaced people who have joined them (5). Since November 1996 the UPDF has been encouraging people to move to these locations for their own protection. Politicians and soldiers are also on record as saying that the villages will be an important part of the UPDF's strategy to isolate the LRA and deny its members food, freedom of movement and the ability to re- group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The World Food Programme (WFP) has decided to implement its food relief to the sites through the UPDF, arguing that the security situation in Gulu is such as to prevent any other way of working. WFP's emergency operation aims to provide food for 70,000 vulnerable people in Gulu district between March and August, as well as 40,000 people in Kitgum. The agency hopes that the Government will step in to address other food relief needs arising from the current emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Humanitarian agencies and NGOs are divided as to whether to assist in the 'protected villages'. It appears that basic services in the villages are inadequate and that public health will be threatened unless international agencies intervene. Humanitarian agencies are, however, reluctant to be seen to be helping implement what they regard as a military strategy, while also questioning whether the villages will protect people or actually make them more vulnerable to attack. The LRA has already stated its opposition to the villages and attacks have taken place despite the presence of UPDF troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. The 'protected villages' are a risky strategy; by gathering people together in crowded conditions, with little to do except wait for the next relief handout, there is a danger the Government will further alienate the very people it would like to count as supporters. This danger will of course be greater if services in the villages are inadequate. It remains to be seen which agencies will decide to provide the assistance which will undoubtedly be needed. Agencies and NGOs currently working in Gulu town include UNICEF, World Vision, Oxfam/Acord and MSF-Holland as well as the Church of Uganda and the Catholic diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. The insecurity in Gulu has undermined the livelihoods of most people, which are overwhelmingly dependent on agriculture. While the cattle population has been decimated over the course of several years, the recent insecurity has also undermined the ability of farm families to harvest their crops and prepare for the forthcoming rainy season. The last harvest, which would have been a bumper crop due to good rains, rotted in the fields as farmers were too frightened to spent time on their land. The ongoing insecurity and mass displacement, as well as the burning of granaries and the destruction of tools by the LRA, threaten to prevent farm families from planting for the next rains, which will lead to food aid dependence well beyond the period envisaged in WFP's current emergency programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. The education and health systems, which were in a state of collapse prior to the establishment of protected villages, will now need to be revived to meet the needs of Gulu's population in the changed context. It is also to be hoped that measures will be put in place to enhance the protection of children, who have been victims of a horrifying LRA abductions campaign which continues unabated, and to combat the spread of landmines, which remain a source of death and injury and an obstacle to the resumption of agricultural activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. As the UN system seeks to respond to the array of humanitarian issues created by the current situation, UNDP in January created a UN Disaster Management Team (UNDMT) for Uganda, as a forum for policy deliberations and the coordination of UN humanitarian assistance to displaced populations across the north of the country. In this context, UNDP recently launched a $5, 357,000 inter-agency appeal to provide assistance to over 180,000 displaced people in northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arua District</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. Arua district, bordered by both Sudan and Zaire, has been subjected to widespread insecurity over recent years as a result of the activities of the West Nile Bank Front, which for many years had bases in Zaire. The insecurity continued during January, with several incidents including attacks on Sudanese refugees in Rhino camp, an ambush on a convoy accompanying two MPs, an attack on the hospital at Yumbe near the Sudan border, as well as cattle rustling and looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. During February Imvepi camp was attacked by the Uganda National Rescue Front II, a splinter group of the WNBF, and six Sudanese refugees had their ears cut off. Later in February, Ikafe refugee camp was attacked by 30 unidentified men and 6 refugees were shot dead, 7 were injured, and one had his ears cut off for alleged cooperation with the UPDF. These acts of mutilation, which bear a strong similarity to similar atrocities in Gulu, are the first of their kind in Arua.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. Arua district is home to about 100,000 Sudanese refugees, almost half of Uganda's total Sudanese refugee population. They were settled in four camps; Koboko, Ikafe and Imvepi, to the north-east of Arua town, and Rhino camp to the south-west. As a result of attacks by the WNBF, however, many of those refugees have been displaced. Within the Ikafe camp area, for example, an estimated 33,000 people out of an original camp size of 55,000, have been displaced from their homes. The insecurity in Arua has also displaced Ugandans from their homes; there are reported to be several thousand displaced people in Koboko town and in the counties of Maracha, Terego and Obongi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19. Displaced refugees find themselves struggling to survive in often desperate conditions. Whereas before they were able to supplement food rations with their own cultivation, having been displaced from the land they are now solely dependent on food relief. This is of particular concern given the fact that insecurity has made it very difficult to truck food relief to the district and WFP is currently supplying half-rations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20. The attacks against the refugees appear to be politically motivated, as the WNBF is believed to suspect some Sudanese refugees of supporting the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which is fighting a protracted war against the Islamic Government of Sudan. The Ugandan Government, for its part, has alleged on numerous occasions that the WNBF is being backed by the Sudanese Government, along with both the LRA and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), which is active in western Uganda (see below).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasese, Kabarole District</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">21. Since mid-November 1996 a group of Ugandan rebels called the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) have caused insecurity and population displacement in the Kasese area to the east of the Ruwenzori mountains. Initially the ADF took control of Mpondwe border post and the nearby town of Bwera, but the UPDF soon regained control of the area. Most of the 25,000 people who had been displaced from their homes into the plains gradually returned to their villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">22. The ADF continued to mount attacks during January and February and there have been a number of serious incidents, including killings of abductees and an attack at a burial service in Bushenyi in which five people were killed. Most of the incidents, however, have been acts of banditry, such as attacks on buses and trading centres. The rebels are reported to have split up into small groups and to have moved further afield than previously, towards Fort Portal to the north and into Queen Elizabeth Park to the south.  A number of reports in the New Vision state that the rebels are short of food and ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">23. The scattering of the ADF rebels within Uganda is the result of the takeover of eastern Zaire by the Zairean ADFL (Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo/Zaire) rebels lead by Laurent Kabila. As the Zairean rebels pushed northwards along Zaire's border with Uganda during January, the Ugandan rebels found themselves unable to operate out of Zaire.  Ugandan security sources, quoted in an article in the New Vision, welcomed the capture of Beni and Bunia airports by the Zairean rebels, saying that it would prevent the ADF from obtaining further supplies from Sudan, which the Ugandan authorities accuse of backing the rebels (see below).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UGANDA'S RELATIONS WITH ZAIRE AND SUDAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">24. Many observers of Uganda argue that prospects for peace in the country are bound up with Uganda's relations with Zaire and Sudan, and in particular the situation along their common borders. The border situation is currently changing, as Zaire's ADFL have established control along Uganda's border with Zaire and as the SPLA seek to regain lost territory in southern Sudan, along Uganda's northern border. These developments have been accompanied by increasingly hostile accusations and recriminations between Uganda, Zaire and Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">25. In January the Zairean Army made a statement accusing Uganda of sending several thousand Ugandan troops to support the ADFL rebels. The Ugandan Government, in a Foreign Ministry statement, described the accusations as 'false and baseless' and reiterated its support for Zaire's territorial integrity. The same statement also noted that President Mobutu had never acted on promises to disarm ex-Rwandan Government soldiers and Interahamwe militiamen who were destabilising neighbouring countries from within Zaire.  In February the Zairean authorities claimed a Ugandan military cargo plane carrying soldiers and equipment had crashed on the Zairean side of the Ruwenzori mountains, citing this as proof of the Ugandan army's involvement in the war in eastern Zaire. The Ugandan army denied the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">26. Whatever the truth of these allegations, it is clear that as the Zairean ADFL rebels have pushed northwards they have established control over territory where the ADF and WNBF had their bases. Indeed, as the ADFL moved north, taking Beni, Bunia, Mahagi, Aru and Ariwara, there were several reports in Ugandan newspapers of direct clashes between the Zairean rebels and the ADF and WNBF. With the ADFL controlling Uganda's entire western border with Zaire, it appears that the ADF have entered Uganda and broken up into smaller groups, while WNBF fighters have scattered eastwards into Uganda and north into Sudan. In the medium- and long-term the loss of Ugandan rebel bases in Zaire is expected is widely expected to improve the security situation in western Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">27. The war of words between Uganda and Sudan also escalated in January and in February Sudan twice bombed Moyo town in northern Uganda. The accusations began with statements by several Sudanese Ministers that Uganda was massing troops along Sudan's southern border in preparation for an attack, and that Uganda was conspiring with Ethiopia and Eritrea, accused of backing rebels in eastern Sudan, to overthrow the Government in Khartoum (6). The Ugandan Government repeatedly denied the allegations, describing the conflict in southern Sudan as 'an internal problem'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">28. Museveni's statement echoed previous remarks on relations between Uganda and Sudan, in which he has welcomed efforts to broker peace between the two countries while expressing scepticism about Sudan's willingness to live up to its commitments. In his New Year address to the nation, Museveni said that following the signing of an Iranian-sponsored peace accord between Uganda and Sudan on 8 September 1996, Sudan was bombing Uganda 'before the ink was dry'. He suggested the Sudanese government 'is not serious about peace. They seem to have an agenda which they must carry out at all costs.'(7)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">29. During the weekend of 8/9 March, the SPLA began an offensive in southern Sudan, and since then are reported to have gained control of several towns: Kaya, Gumuli, Kajo Kaji, Bazi, Kimba, Foki, and Morobo. Sudanese army spokesman General Mohamed al Sanousi Ahmed accused Uganda of having led the attack on Kaya, a claim denied by Eriya Kategaya, Uganda's Foreign Minister (8). The spokesman for the Sudanese army also claimed that attacks against Yei and Bazi were launched from ADFL-held areas in eastern Zaire (9). The SPLA offensive is currently ongoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">30. The Ugandan Government has alleged for many years that the LRA is based in southern Sudan and receives the active support of the Government of Sudan.  Certainly, people displaced in the border area by LRA attacks claim that the LRA came out of, and retreat back into, southern Sudan. It may therefore be expected that as the SPLA moves to establish control over southern Sudan, this will have implications for the security situation in northern Uganda. On previous occasions when the SPLA has controlled Sudan's southern border, LRA activities have been curtailed (10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">31. Within Uganda, political debate continues as to the best way of bringing peace to the north. The Parliamentary Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs released its report on the war in the north, recommending continued dialogue between Uganda and Sudan and strengthening the UPDF to deal with the rebels militarily. The Committee stopped short of calling on the Government to talk directly to the rebels, but in a Minority Report two MPs from the north, Omara Atubo and Norbert Mao, called for direct talks, saying no stone should be left unturned in the search for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">32. In the past, President Museveni has expressed his unwillingness to talk to the rebels unless all of the LRA's victims say they are in favour of talks.  In his recently-released autobiography, 'Sowing the Mustard Seed', Museveni states that, 'On the issue of security I refuse to talk to the bandits, not because they are armed opponents of the government, but because they are criminals... What Kony's bandits are doing is not a crime against the state: it is a crime against the population. They kill peasants, who have nothing to do with state power; they kill young people or kidnap them to make them cannon fodder; they rape women; they marry girls by force; and they spread AIDS in the north. These are crimes against humanity on a massive scale. I find it completely distasteful that people do not condemn with one voice these crimes of Kony and his bandits.'(11)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">33. The current humanitarian situation in northern Uganda remains grave.  Attacks on civilians and refugees are a daily occurrence, often resulting in deaths and horrific injuries. An estimated 100,000 people are displaced within Gulu district and swelling the size of existing settlements designated as 'protected villages', raising serious concerns about public health. In Kitgum an estimated 60,000 people have been displaced from their homes by LRA violence, while in Arua tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have been displaced from their camps by WNBF attacks. While this situation prevails, the food security of communities across the north is rapidly being eroded, raising the spectre of famine or future dependence on food relief. The insecurity also severely impedes access for agencies attempting to provide humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">34. Medium-term prospects for an improvement in the humanitarian situation in northern and western Uganda are inextricably linked with developments along Uganda's common borders with Zaire and Sudan. The takeover of eastern Zaire's border with Uganda by ADFL rebels appears to have made it more difficult for both the Ugandan ADF rebels and WNBF fighters to operate out of Zaire. This is widely expected to lead to improved security in western Uganda over the coming months. The situation in northern Uganda is also expected to be affected by developments in southern Sudan, where the SPLA is seeking to regain control of towns currently under Sudanese Government control. In the past, SPLA control over southern Sudan's border with Uganda has curtailed LRA activities in northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">35. In the long-term, Uganda will also need to address the development gap between southern and northern Uganda if lasting peace is to be secured.  Northern Uganda's current state of crisis merely exacerbates a situation in which the north has lagged behind the south in terms of agriculture, industry, infrastructural development, education and health services. This situation has fuelled resentment and grievances in the north and created a context in which northerners have a lower stake in Uganda's development than their southern counterparts. Unless and until this situation is addressed, something which in turn depends upon improved security in the north, Uganda will find it difficult to achieve lasting stability and economic development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Embattled Dolphin Group president, Ketan Somaia, is scheduled to meet with senior Mpumalanga officials in Johannesburg on Monday afternoon to finalise proposed amendments to his 50-year contract with the Mpumalanga Parks Board (MPB).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract, which was signed secretly in November last year, gave the Dubai-based Dolphin Group a monopoly on commercial development and transverse rights in six State owned game reserves, Blyde River Canyon, Pilgrim's Rest, Loskop Dam and Manyeleti Game Reserve.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community outrage however forced provincial politicians to step in and send a &quot;rescue mission&quot; to London to demand a re-negotiation, including the exclusion of Manyeleti and Pilgrim's Rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other suggested amendments are the scrapping of a 50-year secrecy clause, a reduction in the length of the contract from 50 to 25-years, improved community involvement in joint venture companies and other facets of the proposed developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPB, whose chief executive officer, Alan Gray originally brokered and signed the deal, was not represented on the &quot;rescue mission&quot; and will apparently not attend the finalisation of the contract in Johannesburg later today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the rescue team returned from London, Dolphin and our attorneys have been working on the proposed amendments and will probably be finalising them this afternoon,&quot; said Mpumalanga's Environmental Affairs spokesman, Gary Sutter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I cannot say if the final deal will be signed today or not- we cannot pre-empt a thing like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sutter confirmed that MPB will not be attending the meeting. He was also unable to say who from the Mpumalanga government would be representing South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin's public relations company declined to comment on the meeting today, saying they were having trouble contacting their client. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - Unemployment has dropped from 40 to 30 per cent here in the capital in four years time, head of the region 14 Administration reported yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Ali Abdo told a popular gathering convened to assess performance, discuss future plans and identity other priorities that the rate of unemployment which stood at 40 per cent in 1985 E.C. has dropped to 30 per cent in the following three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributed the positive trend to the opening of private firms the formation by the region of small-scale job creations schemes and the expansion of development works undertaken by the administration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head, however, said despite the encouraging trend, the prevalent unemployment rate itself vividly shows the impoverishment of metropolitans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, a document prepared by the regional council indicated that 3.3 billion birr is needed for the execution of water supply projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document says the regional government spend about 208 million birr for the implementation of water supply projects during the past four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also says the execution of the ongoing water projects costs 865 million birr until 1992 E.C. alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing projects include the Life-saving Water Survey and Construction, the Emergency Sub-terranean Water Development and the Dire Dam and Water supply Study and Control, according to the document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implementation of most of the water supply projects would be completed in the coming year, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also says that the regional administration over the past four years constructed and maintained roads, bridges, sewers and gravel roads at a cost of 92.8 million birr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The construction of medium level drains the administration planned to execute in the coming five years demands more than seven million birr, according to the document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the acute shortage of residential units in the capital, the document says associations and individuals have built over 6,600 houses with some of them still under construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors willing to construct houses for rent were also given land, it says adding that the regional administration on its part has plans to build close to 50,000 houses in the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan the regional administration adopted to alleviate the shortage of residential units is constructing 10,000 houses every year until the completion of the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-day popular gathering attended by representatives of residents of all kebeles in the capital discussed economic issues yesterday and is expected to deliberate on social affairs today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debre Zeit - bilateral and multilateral donors participating in the &quot; government-led workshop( on Ethiopian social sector investment programmes and indicative budgetary support of donors&quot; have agreed to give sum of 665 million US dollars for projects related with the vital sector of health and education in Ethiopia, the resident representative of the World Bank in Ethiopia, Mr. Fayez Omar, said at the conclusion of the three-day workshop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that out of the 665 million dollars, 323 million dollars was meant for the health sector which he added was the very amount calculated to be needed for the sector. He, however, noted that the sum of 332 million dollars for the education sector accounts for just 80 per cent of the expected amount and that it was short by a hefty 148 million dollars, elevating the total required funds to not less than 480 million dollars. but he said that there is a room for optimism as there are many donors, who did not participate in the workshop and hence couldn't propose their pledges and that this gap in the financing of the education sector could be filled when they show up with their pledges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formally closing the workshop the Minister in Charge of Social and Administrative Affairs in the Office of the Prime Minister, Dr. Kebede Tadesse, expressed great pleasure with the invaluable contributions the donors pledged to bring to reality the improvement in quality and quantity of the vital sectors of education and health. &quot;We are very much assured to go further with out efforts to improve these sectors because of your subscriptions today.&quot; Dr. Kebede said. He further appreciated the need for holding such dialogues between government and donors adding that 'we have very flexible attitudes allowing for mutual learning and cooperation to every extent possible.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also noted on the occasion that the largest share of the pledges was made by the World Bank, which pledged to allocate 340 million dollars, out of which 150 million dollars will be disbursed for the health and the remaining 190 million for the education sector. It is to be noted that these pledges are to be paid our of the 2.5 billion dollars pledged by donors and lending agencies at the December world Bank consultative Group meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his opening address, AAU President Dr. Mogessie Ashenafi said that research works within the faculty need to be attuned to solve national problems. He commended the faculty's &quot;good begining&quot; in this direction and hoped others would follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Invited guests, which included representatives of relevant government offices, embassies, the private sector and members of the press, visited the various research activities being conducted in the six departments within the faculty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the departments of: biology, Chemistry, Geology/Geophysics, Mathematics, Physics and Statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first two faculties, the Science Faculty, was reportedly established in 1950 with the founding of the then University College of Addis Ababa. At that time it was giving basic trainings in engineering, medicine and biology and students used to be sent abroad for their first degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faculty sources indicate that advancing science through excellence in teaching and research and contributing to the growth of science and technology in the country remain the main mission of the faculty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the faculty is staffed with 142 academics of whom, 73 are PH.D holders, 50 with MSc, and the remaining with BSc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research activities and findings of the faculty remain open to the public today as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The annual ritual of reburying their dead after heavy summer rains have washed graves open prompted the residents of Ermelo Trust, near Nelspruit in Mpumalanga, to petition their councillors this week to provide alternative cemetaries for the town, which is sited on a rocky hillside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents also complained in the petition, delivered to council offices on Sunday, that because the ground was so hard they could only dig graves two metres deep.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This means that we have to build expensive concrete and brick covers on the graves just to stop thieves from stealing our loved one's coffins and dumping their bodies next to the graves,&quot; explained one of the mouners at Petros Nhlanhla's funeral on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good coffins are so expensive that families have to save for years to afford them and then thieves dishonour both these family's sacrifice and the dead by stealing them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Take the incredible coincidences that created The Beatles, for instance. Imagine if John Lennon had been born in Cape Town and Paul in London and they'd never met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, here's a story something like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 25 years ago, in Galt, Ontario, a high school student tried to get out of a history project by telling his teacher he'd make a short film instead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So he made a four-minute thing shot on 16mm, and it worked. It was about springtime around a farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This got him fired up on film, but, Galt being a sleepy little town with buildings no higher than two stories and he couldn't find anyone in the town to advance his budding interest in film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke to his girlfriend, who casually said he should talk to her father, who was involved in film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought maybe he worked for Kodak or something, so I didn't speak to him for a while,&quot; the young man said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when he did, he discovered Robert Kerr and his partner Graham Ferguson &quot; inventing the IMAX system, right there in Galt&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were as surprised as I was to find someone interested in film-making in Ontario,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so one of the world's most intriguing partnerships was born, with the young man, David Douglas, becoming one of IMAX's best-ever film directors, and the small, home-grown IMAX industry made up of &quot;four guys from Galt&quot; growing to colossal proportions worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas is a man who's dedicated to everything Hollywood doesn't stand for, who has a vision of a new film system that's &quot;akin to live theatre, in which the audience is also a player&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMAX, incidentally, is a super-huge large-format film type shown on giant screens. It deals mainly with documentary subjects - ranging from wildlife and outer space to The Rolling Stones live in concert - and it packs people in like no other form of film-making does, because it's a sensation, an experience, rather than a movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making these giant films is an equal experience, according to Douglas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's really nothing like it. It's a very generous medium and it raises the level of what filmed entertainment should be about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IMAX evolved in an atmosphere where film was in a phase of decline to the rise of TV, and it balanced TV. It was hatched outside the Hollywood system and developed by documentary film makers in a tradition of experimental cinema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I often wonder if it would have remained true to itself if it had happened in Hollywood, but we had a long term view and wound up with new technology and a new tradition of film-making based on the spectacular photo- extravaganza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a 1990s version of what the National Geographic Magazine was to the 1950s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To make these films, one has to understand the experience of the audience in the theatre. It's a participatory medium and the audience has many choices to make on what to look at on such a giant screen. A good film should support all their choices well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It becomes an experience instead of a linear story. It's broadband - everything is included. Watching it is like being a fly on the wall of life, and the film can carry any number of storylines, many themes in the same image, whereas the small screen forces the viewer to go through a story only one way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a complex medium, but so is life. When IMAX works properly it's like life,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A veteran of more than 30 IMAX films as director or director of photography, Douglas says two of his favourite films are the pair he did with his producer wife, The Fires Of Kuwait and Survival Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fires was a &quot;dark and serious&quot; experience for him, which he admits &quot;left me feeling drained emotionally&quot;, as he stared through the lens at the inhuman devastation of the oil-well fires in Kuwait following the Gulf War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The flip side to that was Survival Island which was hopeful and positive, and balanced my emotions. After Fires I just needed to be around life, so we spent five months on South Georgia Island among fantastic numbers of creatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was an expedition in small ships with little chance of support if anything went wrong. We got off the island just before the big winter storms came in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In total contrast was his project on the Rolling Stones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just got on to what I can only describe as the Rolling Stones machine and we weren't in control of anything, travelling with this small army of some 400 people across the world. It was a fantastic combination of the medium and the show.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The highly competitive home video industry is coming under the spotlight at the Competition Board after bitter complaints from video store owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Competition Board said last week it was launching an investigation into the pricing policies and any alleged anti-competitive behaviour of the two leading video distributors, Nu-Metro Video and Ster-Kinekor Video, which has resulted in widespread dissent and a civil suit to be heard in the Pretoria High Court next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Competition Board director of investigations Steve Abraham said this was not the first spat between Nu-Metro Video, Ster-Kinekor Video and video store owners to come before the Competition board.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989, the board had to intervene when it became apparent that some distributors were engaging in restrictive practices which were subsequently outlawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The complexities and the competition law implications of the relevant issues raised by the latest round of allegations and counter-allegations - coupled with irreconcilable differences of opinion between the distributors and the dealers on those issues - requires a formal investigation,&quot; said Mr Abraham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leading complainants are Ultra Videos of Pretoria, Steers subsidiary Blockbuster Videos, and Cape Town-based Omega Videos, but Mr Abraham said the board had also received complaints from many other smaller dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesmen for both Nu-Metro and Ster-Kinekor said they &quot;welcome the investigation&quot; and &quot;believe it will bring stability to the market&quot;. They declined to comment further as the matter was now sub-judice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main concerns expressed by the dealers were Nu-Metro's and Ster- Kinekor's policies and pricing on bulk buying and the treatment of franchises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dealers said videos were sold to them in packages of four or five videos - which normally included one blockbuster, two &quot;medium&quot; films and two &quot;weak&quot; films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is that if a small store wants to buy top titles, it has to buy too many titles to get decent prices as low as R200 or pay top prices, as much as R320, for blockbuster films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps more damaging in the longer term is Ster-Kinekor and Nu-Metro's refusal to recognise franchises as bulk buyers, instead insisting on dealing with franchise outlets on an individual basis. As one dealer said, this practically removed franchising as an attractive vehicle for development, by &quot; robbing&quot; them of the discounts normally attributed to franchise bulk buying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ster-Kinekor and Nu-Metro also strictly disallow franchisors to sub- distribute their wares. &quot;In the event of us not performing exactly the way prescribed by the 'majors', which includes the signing of a &quot;conditions of sale agreement for Ster-Kinekor&quot;, we simply receive a threat of non-delivery, which can be potentially disastrous to any video store,&quot; the dealer said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Today the Cape Argus marks its 140th anniversary with much cause for celebration. Over the past six months it has undergone the greatest rejuvenation in its existence and it has emerged from the exercise with renewed vitality and strength, having passed the most critical test of all - the verdict of its readers, who now number more than before the rejuvenation began, confirming the Cape Argus as the biggest, oldest, favourite newspaper in the Cape metropolitan area - by far.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as we look back on the past 140 years there is much more cause for satisfaction. A newspaper which was launched in the time of Cecil Rhodes and which then unashamedly defended the imperialist ideal stands firmly and proudly today as a part of the new South Africa. That transformation has been momentous, but no more so than the changes that have shaped the Western Cape and the country itself; changes wrought by seminal events like the South African War, the two great world conflagrations in which Cape Town and South Africa played such a critical role, and the arduous struggle for the equality of all South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Argus was in the thick of these events, bringing its readers the information and informed analysis they needed to shape their own lives. But through it all there were also more intimate changes, catalogued in the daily notices of births and deaths, engagements and marriages; the political, intellectual, cultural and sporting highlights of a changing society, the fluctuations of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an exciting history which has brought with it new challenges for South Africans to face. The country, the Cape and The Cape Argus will face them together - as we have done for the past 140 years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Khayelitsha police station is sinking under the weight of the township's population explosion and needs a radical face-lift to reach service levels found at formerly white stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its staff members are battling with seemingly insurmountable problems in their aim to provide a professional service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The township needs at least three police stations if staff are to cope, said station commissioner Hennie Haarhoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serious problems such as a huge backlog of cases, a shortage of vehicles and staff, the difficulty of retraining poorly-educated &quot;kits konstabels&quot; and a clash between the state and the traditional laws of the Xhosa-speaking township are hindering effective police work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff members are alleging further problems are caused by a lack of transformation towards a more enlightened style of policing the community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sprawling township's population has more than doubled in three years - from 300 000 in 1993 to more than 650 000 last year - due to a mass migration from the former homelands of Ciskei and Transkei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new report compiled by Khayelitsha police station management focuses on the internal and external factors adding to the police's frustrations in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was released to members of the Provincial Service's standing committee on safety and security last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compared to other areas where police are viewed as more effective, Khayelitsha residents lodge a relatively low number of complaints - about 600 a month as opposed to 1 700 in Bellville which has a far smaller population of 180 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These figures indicate a lack of trust and co-operation from residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The crime is there, but it doesn't get reported,&quot; said Director Haarhoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the relatively low reporting of cases, detectives have been swamped with investigations, but do not have the staff to deal with the cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special task team had been called in to tackle a backlog of 3 000 cases, some 2 000 of which relate to serious crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was estimated that 75 percent of the population was unemployed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed robbery was escalating due to an increase in businesses in the township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to a lack of accommodation at the police station the detective branch had been relocated to Harare police station, about six kilometres away. But this split hindered effective co-operation between the two stations the uniformed branch in solving cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that people making complaints at the charge office have to be transported by police members to the new detective premises for the case to be investigated.This unnecessarily ties up staff and vehicles, both of which are in short supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are also having to fetch and transport witnesses to court or they will not appear due to a lack of public transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless we divide the area into smaller sections, I don't see how things can improve,&quot; Director Haarhoff said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Haarhoff said they needed an office block housing all support services such as finances, logistics, administration and human resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vigilante action in the community also poses an ongoing problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents who apprehend a thief may beat him badly before taking him to the police station. As a result such a person needs urgent medical attention before investigations can proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, Xhosa-speaking people, especially those who recently moved from rural areas in the Eastern Cape, do not always understand legislation and its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police functioning is often foreign to them and sometimes not acceptable to the community as a whole, the report reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The introduction to Khayelitsha police station of 150 &quot;kitskonstabels&quot; in 1987 has proved to be a massive problem too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many had little or no education and their retraining in the new dispensation is difficult - especially those who are illiterate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Haarhoff said these difficulties posed on-going obstacles to effective policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A solution, he said, would be to transfer some of the &quot;kitskonstabels&quot; to other stations in exchange for more supervisors, of whom Khayelitsha had a drastic shortage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff say the untenable situation at the police station is exacerbated by racism, little affirmative action, poor management, a language barrier between staff and residents and the continuing existence of the old &quot;brute force&quot; policing style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two police members, who are known to Cape Argus, but spoke on condition of remaining anonymous, said only two black policemen had been appointed to management level and more were needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the community did not trust Khayelitsha police because many of the coloured and white staff still treated residents abominably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspects were often beaten by police who also break people's front doors to apprehend suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White police officers must learn to treat the people nicely, to joke with them and ask first if they can search their homes instead of just breaking the door down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They must change their style if they want to work well in the community,&quot; one of the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two said the language barrier was a problem for Afrikaans and English- speaking coloured and white staff, many of whom declined to work in the charge office because they could not take statements from Xhosa-speaking complainants and witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On duty, these police often had to be accompanied by a black police member to translate for them, adding further to the staff shortage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was alleged the top management frequently refused suggestions made by black police members wanting to change the policing style to one more understanding of Xhosa culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management also failed to resolve problems put to them by black staff, such as the transport crisis. It was alleged that white staff take home the station's best vehicles, thus depleting the inadequate pool of cars for reaction to crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hardly any cars are left for duties after 4pm,&quot; a second source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Director Haarhoff denied that many of the vehicles used for shift work were being taken home by white officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best vehicles were allocated to the shifts and some of the cars were used by officers on duty at night, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has applied for a 36-seater bus to help transport staff to and from work and this will free up other vehicles used for this purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to allegations of a lack of affirmative action, Director Haarhoff said he expected the third round of appointments at the level of captain and superintendent to be made shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a case of us holding back promotions. We must wait for the process to be completed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workshops had been held with the local community policing forum to thrash out problems between the police and the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More workshops were planned for transforming the style of policing of members still in the old way of thinking when dealing with residents, he said, adding that police members only smashed down front doors if they had a search warrant to locate illegal firearms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this case we can't knock to warn the occupants because they frequently fire through the walls when they realise the police are outside and there are no brick walls to hide behind,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the language issue, he said that in Cape Town Xhosa-speaking police were in demand at stations serving an area with a large Xhosa population and that there were not enough of these members to go around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 40 black police reservists had recently joined the station and another 50 were being trained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many changes had been made at the police station, but there was still a long road ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not going to solve our problems overnight. We do the best we can,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Anti-apartheid campaigner Allan Boesak, back home to appear in court today on fraud and theft charges, is believed to have had a private meeting with President Mandela soon after arriving yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professing his innocence, Dr Boesak, who faces 21 counts of theft and nine of fraud involving nearly R2-million, received a hero's welcome at Cape Town airport after more than a year in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appeared in Cape Town Magistrate's Court today, but the case was postponed to August 4 in the Cape High Court. An African National Congress spokesman said the trial was expected to last at least eight months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boesak was given a red carpet welcome at the airport by about 3 000 supporters, led by Justice Minister Dullah Omar, who has come under fire for supporting Dr Boesak openly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Omar said he had gone to the airport to meet Dr Boesak at the express request of Mr Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was confirmed by a spokesman in the president's office, who said he did not understand what the &quot;fuss&quot; was about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman said he &quot;thought&quot; the president met Dr Boesak privately yesterday but could not say what the meeting was about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dr Boesak is a human being who does not deserve to be hounded in this way.  He is no longer a public representative. He is a citizen who is entitled to be supported by friends and those who know him when he faces difficulties,&quot; said the spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mr Mandela had indicated a need for South Africans to treat one another humanely throughout his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In that context the president would want to look at Dr Boesak not only as a citizen, but also as his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president often says the strength of a person is not never to fall, but to rise every time you fall,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of South Africa's &quot;dented&quot; history and the fact that many people in high places had been pardoned or forgiven and still played an important role in public life, the president urged public commentators and political parties to have &quot;a global view&quot; when looking at the affairs of the country, the spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boesak returned to Cape Town with his wife Elna and their five-year-old daughter Sarah-Len after several days consulting lawyers in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His four children from his previous marriage, Lieneker, Allan, Belen and Pulani, and his 84-year-old mother Sarah were at the airport to welcome him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boesak was carried shoulder-high by chanting supporters as hundreds more tried to touch him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if he were found guilty, the anti-apartheid struggle would stand condemned for what it had done. &quot;I have come back to this country, my country, my home, because I am not afraid to face those who have charged me; because I am, as they know, totally innocent of the charges they have levelled against me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Omar, who has been criticised by the National and Democratic parties for publicly pledging his solidarity with Dr Boesak, said he had been told by Mr Mandela to welcome him home. &quot;Comrade Mandela told me: 'Dullah, you're going to the airport.' I welcome Comrade Allan on behalf of the entire African National Congress,&quot; Mr Omar said to thunderous applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DP and NP say Mr Omar, as political head of the justice system under which Dr Boesak is being tried, should not show open support for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party said it was &quot;unacceptable, unsuitable and unjustifiable&quot; for a minister of justice to intervene with comments on behalf of an accused while the case against that person was pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were specifically critical of the minister's comments that &quot;struggle bookkeeping&quot; might be to blame for the charges against Dr Boesak, saying the minister should remember the background of rampant commercial crime and corruption against which the case would be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The minister should also remember that the most damaging aspect of the Boesak case was the heightened scepticism of foreign donor agencies channelling much-needed aid to legitimate local NGOs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Omar denied any conflict between his public support for Dr Boesak and his position as minister of justice. He said the criticism came from elements of the old apartheid era who were still operating in the new democracy. As minister of justice he had not interfered in the legal process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Omar said although 1994 had brought political change, most public institutions - media, police and judiciary - were still in the hands of those who controlled them in the apartheid era. In a marquee outside the airport, supporters chanted &quot;Boesak, Boesak&quot;, toyi-toyied, and jeered the two Afrikaans newspapers, Die Burger and Rapport, whom they accused of hounding Dr Boesak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boesak told the crowd he was totally innocent of the charges and said he had faced worse tribulations in his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's history and the nation's collective conscience would have to explain how it had come about that he had to return to Cape Town to stand trial while murderers of children were free, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How is it possible that I stand accused while those who took the lives of our children sit in Parliament?&quot; Dr Boesak asked.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Adv Denzil Potgieter SC, Chairperson, Media &amp; Communications Committee, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, March 16, 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has set May 30 this year as the deadline for submissions on the role which the media played in South Africa during the period from 1960 to the 1994 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TRC's working group on the media -- set up by the Human Rights Violations Committee of the Commission -- is pleased to report that it has already begun to receive submissions in connection with a possible special hearing on the media. Submissions from a number of individual journalists, as well as organisations, are expected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Submissions received so far support the impression given by the current public debate that there is considerable interest in this matter, not only within the media but also from the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Submissions, whether from individuals or organisations, should be sent to any regional office of the Truth Commission, or to the head office at P O Box 3162, Cape Town, 8000, to reach the Commission by 30 May 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decision will then finally be made as to whether a special hearing on the media needs to take place, and what form it should take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission has been given the responsibility by the Promotion of National Unity &amp; Reconciliation Act to &quot;establish the truth in relation to past events&quot;. These events specifically involve &quot;gross human rights violations&quot; erpetrated within a political context between March 1960 and 10 May 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission has a dual responsibility here, which suggests two sorts of submissions from the media: firstly, to offer victims, particularly those journalists whose stories of abuse under apartheid have not been heard, the opportunity of telling their stories; and, secondly, to provide &quot;as complete a picture as possible&quot; of the &quot;nature, causes and extent of&quot; such abuses, including &quot;the antecedents, circumstances, factors and context of such violations...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is not simply a question of looking at the role of the media during the apartheid years, and the experiences of individual journalists during those years, but also of describing the context in which the media functioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the Commission has the added responsibility of producing a final report in which recommendations are made to Parliament as to the future of those sectors covered by Commission hearings. This too provides all sectors of the media with an opportunity -- and a challenge -- to make suggestions for their future development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Zairean rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), capitalizing on their Kisangani victory, are advancing to the west and south of Zaire. Retreating FAZ troops are reported to have reached Yangambi, about 50 km west of Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADFL spokesman Raphael Ghenda told AFP that on Friday rebels had taken Pweto, a town on Lake Moero which straddles the Zambia-Zaire border.  Humanitarian sources today confirmed to IRIN the takeover. Sources also report looting soldiers passing through Luanza, south of Pweto. To the west, two disorderly soldiers were reported killed recently by the local population in Kikondjo, a riverside town southwest of Manono. Soldiers are reportedly fleeing towards Kolwezi, to the west of Lubumbashi and not far from the Zambian border. &quot;Lubumbashi is the next big target&quot;, rebel leader Laurent- Desire Kabila told a news conference in Goma on Saturday. &quot;We are still advancing,&quot; he added, reports Reuters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The ADFL continues to reject calls for a ceasefire, and Kabila is reported as saying that only face-to-face talks with Mobutu might &quot;constitute some kind of pause&quot;, reports Reuters yesterday. Joint OAU/UN Special Representative Mohamed Sahnoun and UN Humanitarian Coordinator Pierce Gerety met with Kabila on Saturday in Goma, but made no statement after the meeting.  The Kinshasa government has indicated its willingness to respect a ceasefire.  UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan is reported to be adopting a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude, while the European Union on Sunday appealed to all parties to &quot; respect both the refugees and the Zairean population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Joseph Kabila, Laurent Desire's 25-year-old son, who described himself as &quot;operational commander of the northern sector&quot; for the ADFL, told Reuters that the biggest problem after capturing Kisangani was a &quot;carpet&quot; of mines on roads leading to the city, except the one used by the FAZ for retreat. He said demining was his priority. He denied that aircraft had been destroyed by retreating soldiers and mercenaries, saying his forces had found no airplanes at the airport. He said no mercenaries appear to have died in the battle for the city, according to CNN. The government of Zaire alleged today that the battle for Kisangani involved &quot;heavily armed regular units of the Ugandan army equipped with sophisticated weapons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, urged the ADFL not to attack Ubundu, where up to 100,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees have congregated. Ogata, in a statement from Geneva yesterday, said that Ubundu &quot; is the last place where we can locate them and help them.&quot; &quot;The refugees are at the end of their strength. Their harrowing odyssey through the wilderness has to stop now, or many more lives will be lost&quot;, the statement says. Even if security can be established, the diplomatic and logistical challenges in supplying Ubundu - still technically under Zairean government control - will be formidable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The hazardous crossing of the Zaire river and capsizing of boats at Ubundu had left refugees stranded on rocks in the middle of the river on Friday, several sources say. An AFP correspondent, flying overhead, reported seeing the wreckage of three rafts and a large canoe stuck on the rocks in the river. Recent reports say that about 40 canoes are taking passengers across the river for a fee, while rafts are being constructed from plastic sheeting, bamboo and empty barrels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Three European NGOs (ACF, MSF-France and MSF-Belgium) have attempted to investigate the feasibility of establishing a new airlift route to Ubundu using an airstrip at Bokungu, 300 km southwest of Kisangani as a base. The team left Kinshasa on Friday, but were not permitted to fly from Bokungu to Ubundu by local officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Maj-Gen Paul Kagame, Rwandan vice-president and minister of defence, said that any multinational force for eastern Zaire could &quot;contribute to the deterioration of the situation&quot; because &quot;those who are looking for this kind of intervention have other motives altogether&quot;. In a broadcast on Radio Rwanda, referring to the plight of Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire, he said that the majority of Rwandan refugees had returned home, and that &quot;these ones (still in Zaire) particularly refused to return to their country. And there is not much we can do about it. I think they will have to pay a price for not making the correct decision...The issue is just to continue urging the refugees to return&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An emergency cabinet meeting was called by the Zairean government in Kinshasa today. Sporadic gunshots were reported overnight in Kinshasa, Reuters reported. A communique from today's meeting urged people not to give in to &quot;unwarranted panic&quot;, according to AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* While ADFL rebels declare that &quot;the Mobutu era is over&quot;, Zairean politicians and western diplomats are re-aligning themselves in the expectation of a further decline in the health of the Mobutu regime, analysts say. President Mobutu Sese Seko's return to Zaire from France has been delayed until next week, according to aides, and he has remained in hospital since Sunday. French Foreign Minstry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told a news briefing that &quot;Mobutu's health is an additional source of concern in the Zairean crisis&quot;, Reuters reports. Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derijcke said today that &quot;the Mobutu era came to an end some time ago&quot; and that Kabila &quot; cannot be ignored&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), the party of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi on Friday said that the UDPS and ADFL were pursuing the same objectives - &quot;the eradication of dictatorship and the establishment of a state that respects the rule of law.&quot; According to Gabonese radio, Adrien Mpongo Kunda said the UDPS took credit for weakening the government through non-violent means, thereby easing the progress of the rebellion. Adrien Mpongo further suggested that a Zairean roundtable conference be part of the Nairobi III diplomatic initiative. He further proposed a merger of the FAZ and ADFL forces as part of a future peace deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Following his visit to Goma, Mohamed Sahnoun met with Pierre Buyoya, Burundi's military ruler yesterday, but no details of the meeting have emerged. The Burundi regime now claims that the anti-tank mines which killed seven people in Bujumbura were part of last week's coup attempt. Five people have so far been arrested on charges of plotting to assassinate the regime's leader, Pierre Buyoya. A number of western embassies and aid agencies in Bujumbura have recommended their expatriates observe an informal curfew from about 7 pm onward. The official curfew - from midnight until dawn - is unchanged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Yasushi Akashi, has announced the appointment of Pierce Gerety as UN Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes Region. Gerety succeeds Martin Griffiths, who has resumed his functions as Director the Geneva Office of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs. Gerety, who most recently served as UNICEF's Emergency Coordinator for the Great Lakes, will be based in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Independent Belgrade-based radio B92, monitored by BBC, reported yesterday that a mercenary, known only as &quot;V.N.&quot; revealed that 60 mercenaries from southern Serbia are to leave this week to join others already in Zaire fighting on the government side. &quot;V.N.&quot; said that a three-month contract would earn him $6,000, while his family would receive $100,000 if he dies during the mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An international Convention against mercenaries adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989 has been ratified by only 11 countries. The Convention can enter into force only after 22 states have ratified or acceded to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The trial of Georges Rutaganda is to start tomorrow at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania. Rutaganda, allegedly a leader of the notorious Interahamwe militia, was charged last May with eight counts of genocide and crimes against humanity. The Tribunal ruled on March 6 that 16 witnesses for the defence in the trial of Rutaganda were being sought.  The witnesses were last known to be in Tingi-Tingi refugee site in eastern Zaire, and the Tribunal ruled that they should be located and placed under the protection of the Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Honore Rakotomanana, the deputy prosecutor the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda who resigned last month, will return to his native Madagascar, reports AFP. Rakotomanana and registrar Andronico Adede of Kenya both handed in their resignations to UN Secretary-General kofi Annan after an UN investigation into the Arusha operation accused Adede of mismanagement and said that Rakotamanana had failed to persue masterminds of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In a statement, Rakotamana said that he had resigned &quot;because of divergences of views between my hierarchial superiors and myself and in the superior interests of the population of Rwanda&quot;. Twenty-one people accused of masterminding or being involved in the genocide have been indicted by the Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rwanda, 128 new judges were sworn in at the National Assembly on Friday.  The cases of four suspects accused of crimes against humanity in Kibungu prefecture are expected to resume tomorrow, according to Rwandan radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The latest round of talks between Uganda and Sudan are reported to have ended in failure after intensive discussions in Entebbe which concluded on Saturday. The Ugandan Sunday Vision reported that the two sides failed to agree on the wording of a proposed communique, with Uganda seeking to condemn abductions of children in northern Uganda and Sudan refusing mention of this in the communique. On Friday Ugandan radio reported President Museveni condemning 'Sudanese-sponsored terrorists who mutilate Ugandan civilians and kidnap schoolchildren.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talks, chaired by Iran's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Akhbar Velayati and also involving Malawi's Foreign Minister, Dr A.G. Nga Mtafu, sought to improve relations between Uganda and Sudan, under growing strain over Sudanese accusations of Ugandan support for the SPLA offensive in southern Sudan and Ugandan claims of Sudanese support for the LRA and WNBF.  Iran's minister of Foreign Affairs announced on Sunday that the next round of talks will take place in June in Tehran, at foreign ministers' level.  Uganda's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Eriya Kategaya, had criticized Sudan the previous day for sending a civil servant, Under Secretary Ali Elnimari, to represent them in the recent talks. Earlier talks had either involved heads of state or ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPLA offensive continued over the weekend, with the SPLA reportedly capturing Lainya on Saturday afternoon. Lainya, a former Sudanese army garrison town, lies about halfway along the main road between Yei and Juba.  The capture of Yei by the SPLA was confirmed over the weekend, after initial denials from the Sudanese Government. On Sunday, the Sudanese Government reported that it had recaptured the eastern town of Chali el-Fil from the SPLA, which took the town in January. Chali el-Fil lies is in Blue Nile state about 30 km from the border with Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ugandan Sunday Monitor reported yesterday that Colonel Juma Oris, commander of the WNBF, was killed on Saturday during fighting near the Uganda- Sudan border between the WNBF and the UPDF. The report cited 'military sources' in Kampala but gave no further details. Juma Oris was previously a minister in Idi Amin's Government. The New Vision reported last Thursday that Morobo, a town close to Sudan's border with Zaire, which was taken by the SPLA on Wednesday, had since 1985 been the operational and training headquarters of the WNBF.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The International Secretariat of OMCT/SOS-Torture has received new information concerning 31 officers detained in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brief reminder of the situation: In September of 1996 OMCT was informed of the arrest and detainment of a number of Sudanese Army officers in Port Sudan on 15 August. The officers were transferred to Khartoum, where reports suggested that they had been tortured. The officers were also denied the right to receive visits from family and lawyers, so was impossible to ascertain their fate or exact whereabouts. It was believed that some had been executed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New information: According to a reliable source, the right to a fair trial is allegedly being violated in the case of 31 army officers and civilians currently on trial for attempting to overthrow the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OMCT has great concern over the defendants' right to a fair trial for three reasons. First, several of the defendants are civilians, and are being judged by a military court tribunal. Second, the trial is not open to the public.  Third, the tribunal ordered the immediate submission of the defence council's final statement. When the defence council asked for time to prepare the statement, they were told that the tribunal would file for judgement by the end of the day whether the defence statement had been submitted or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following persons are among the accused (given the circumstances the complete list is unknown) :</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LALIBELA (ENA) - A gold Cross weighing five kg. and believed to have seen eight centuries was stolen from the Medhanialem church in Lalibela. The mystery of the theft still revolves around those serving in the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bugna Woreda police office has detained some 13 of the church-men in connection with the robbery.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Issued by the Economic Policy Advisory Unit Office of the Prime Minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first quarter of 1996/97, internal balance of the economy was well maintained. Inflation levelled-off at a negative rate, growth of money supply decelerated, and the government budget attained an overall surplus. In the external sector, trade imbalance widened while foreign exchange market segmentation narrowed substantially. On top of last year's high growth rate, imports rose sharply and net foreign reserves declined marginally, due to both trade deficit and capital outflows, though still remaining ample with a coverage of several months of imports. At the same time, the exchange rate premium in the parallel market declined sharply following the termination of the franco valuta import trade in July, except for used vehicles which was allowed to continue until the end of September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inflation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inflation stood below zero during the quarter. Year-on- year inflation rate for the quarter as a whole was negative 7 per cent, and that of 12-months moving average was minus 1.7 per cent. Thus both in terms of trend and quarterly figures the general price level was declining. The fall in prices was most pronounced in cereals which showed a decline of 14 per cent, compared to the same quarter of the previous year, while prices of non-food items decreased by 2.3 per cent.  For food items in total, the quarter-to- quarter fall in prices was minus 8.8 per cent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negative inflation rate witnessed during the first quarter of 96/97 was, as in previous quarters, largely due to the impressive growth of food production during 95/96. Food prices appear to be set to stay constant for the current year as a whole, as agricultural output from the 96/97 main crop(Mehir) season is expected to show further growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, the decline of the inflation rate of manufactured goods and services (i.e. non-food items) over several months, which reflects both increase in domestic production and imports, is also of significance, though of lesser amount. It attests to prudent monetary and foreign exchange policies, in addition to growth of the non-agricultural sector. Price changes were limited between the first quarter of 96/97 and the last quarter of 95/96. The general price level decreased marginally by 1.3 per cent despite seasonal price increases of cereals by 2 per cent. But,. prices of non-cereal food items decreased by a significant amount of 2.8 per cent, or an annualised rate of 11.2 per cent. As for manufactured goods and services, the price index was virtually constant, having decreased by a mere 0.2 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the quarter itself volatility of prices was negligible. Except for the index of non-food items, the other indices for cereal and non-cereals showed no fluctuation of prices. Even for non-food items, price fluctuation was of a significant amount only once, between august and September, in which it amounted to nearly 3 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money supply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money supply in the first quarter compared to the last quarter of the previous year increased by a small margin of 1.2 per cent (annualised 4.8 per cent). Net foreign assets declined by a significant margin of a quarterly rate of 5.7 per cent, whereas net domestic assets increased by 5.8 per cent.  The decrease in net foreign assets was largely due to a single capital outflow, which accounted for three-fourth of the fall. Growth of net domestic assets, on the other side, was nearly all accounted for by an increase in net claims against the government at the end of the fiscal year, counter-balanced by a reduction of nearly half of this amount by expansion of residual(or uncleared balance) bank liabilities. Credit to the private sector accounted for a mere 5 per cent of the quarterly increase in net domestic assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit to the private sector increased at a quarterly rate of 0.4 per cent, whereas compared to the same quarter of the previous year it stood at 36.3 per cent higher. This indicates seasonality of credit expansion, which tends to be concentrated in the second half of the fiscal year. Given that net foreign assets are likely to decrease in dollar terms from the September level, and that net of the fiscal year, growth of money supply for the current year should be expected to fall well within the target rate of 9.1 per cent without any need to apply credit ceilings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broad money grew by 195 mn Birr, of which 171 mn was quasi-money and only 24 mn was narrow money. Within narrow money, currency in-circulation, in fact declined by 364 mn Birr, while demand deposits increase marginally higher, by 389 mn Birr. Hence, the quarterly increase in money supply is essentially attributable to a change in the composition of broad money, with a decrease in the ratio of currency to deposits. This is partly a continuation of a trend observed in recent years. But, the sharp decline of currency outside banks by 6.4 per cent between end-June and September 96 appears to be connected more with the termination of the franco valuta trade and the shrinking of the parallel market for foreign exchange during the quarter. As demand for cash holding declined due to the partial disappearance of the parallel market, dealers in foreign exchange have shifted, it seems, to deposit holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The year-to-year growth of broad money in September amounted to 9.2 per cent which is within range of the 96/97 target of 9.1 per cent. As the base figure of broad money will be increasing significantly in the subsequent quarters, the prospect of meeting the target of money supply by the end of the current fiscal year appears reasonably good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exchange Rate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several changes are envisaged in the foreign exchange regime, conforming with the policy to introduce an inter-bank foreign exchange market within the coming three year. As a first step, the existing auction was made more frequent by establishing weekly markets starting from 27 July. At the same time, franco valuta import trade was terminated, with a deadline of end-July later extended to end-September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this quarter the marginal rate of the auction market stayed stable, with slight changes from 6.35 Birr per US dollar at the end of June to 6.33 and 6.34 at end of July and August respectively. By the end of Septmeber, though, the rate increased significantly b a monthly rate of 0.8 per cent reaching 6.39 Birr per dollar. In real terms, the Birr, in fact, depreciated more as domestic prices fell by a quarterly rate of 1.3 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the parallel market the rate fell sharply in July by as much as 5.3 per cent from 7.6 Birr per dollar to 7.15. this fall was triggered by the announcement of the termination of the franco valuta import trade as of the end of July, and the deregulation of the current account envisaged for the future. In the following month the premium of the dollar widened with the rate rising to 7.27 Birr, in response to the extension of the deadline for the ending of the private sector franco valuta imports. By the end of September the rate had almost reverted to its previous position, decreasing to 7.18 Birr per US dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The differential between the auction and parallel market rates narrowed markedly during the quarter. Having stood at 18.9 per cent at the end of the previous quarter, the gap narrowed to 13 per cent in July and further to 12.3 per cent in September. Although the marginal rate did increase in September, the reduction of the premium was predominantly due the appreciation of the Birr in the parallel market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government Finance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although government revenue in the first quarter declined 18.6 per cent below the same quarter of previous year, total expenditure as well fell 15.5 per cent below, resulting in overall budgetary surplus. compared to 96.97 budget, the revenue performance of the first quarter is, however, unsatisfactory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the current fiscal year, total revenue is expected to increase by 7.9 per cent, with a growth of 9 per cent in tax revenue and 5.3 per cent of non- tax revenue. Against these budgetary figures, comparison of this year's first quarter with last year's show that revenue fell by 18.6 per cent, due to a fall of non-tax revenue by 37.5 per cent. Moreover, the revenue of both direct and indirect taxes in the first quarter compares unfavourably with the budgetary estimates for the fiscal year. The latter foresees an increase of 14.2 per cent in indirect tax revenue coupled with a constant level of direct tax revenue, while the result of the first quarter shows an increase of only 6.4 per cent for revenue from indirect taxes and a decline of 11.1 per cent in direct tax revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, strong conclusions should not be drawn from the performance of a single quarter, because of certain irregularities in the variations of revenue collection between fiscal years. Profit taxes, which account for no less than two-thirds of direct taxes, are payable by second week of November, more than a month after the first quarter. Actual payments, in fact, get made through out the year. Non-tax revenues also depend on profits of government enterprises, and additionally on proceeds from sales of government enterprises which has its own pace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, it would be valid to make year-to-year comparisons of quarterly revenue collection from indirect taxes, as these are largely free from irregular variations. thus the weak performance of the first quarter raise some doubt on the attainment of the current year's indirect tax revenue budget estimate. Revenue from taxes on foreign trade are apparently on target, so it is that of domestic sources which is lagging behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expenditure, on the other side, was markedly below the same quarter of last year as well as the budgetary appropriation for this year. Recurrent and capital expenditures in the first quarter fell by 15.7 and 15.1 per cent respectively compared to the previous year. The contraction of expenditure is even greater when viewed in terms of the budget for the current year which envisages an increase of 10.9 per cent in the recurrent budget and a 36.2 per cent rise in the capital budget. A relatively small part of the lag in the recurrent expenditure is due to a lower to seasonality.  But, overall, the indication from the performance of the first quarter is that there could be greater savings on the recurrent budget than foreseen, and that the appropriations for the capital budget might not be fully utilised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real Economy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quarterly review will no longer report on the manufacturing sector.  this is because of limitations of the available data, which, being confined to a fixed set of enterprises, do not cover new factories that are being established. consequently, it will be only foreign trade that is included in the discussion of the real economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first quarter the value of exports of coffee maintained the same level of last year despite falling prices due to a sharp rise in volume.  compared to the first quarter of the previous year, the quantity of exports of coffee surged by 24.7 per cent. this increase indicates that a substantially high level of stocks were held at the end of 95.96 coffee season, as exports of first quarter originates entirely from stocks. Other, non-coffee exports, on the other hand, declined by about 12 per cent.  although variability of seasonal changes could be an important factor, this decline of non-coffee exports is significant enough to adversely affect the export level for the year as a whole unless it is offset by the performance of subsequent months. In the first quarter it led to about 4.7 per cent decline in the total value of exports compared to the same quarter of the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorised imports by NBE(National Bank of Ethiopia), decreased by a quarterly rate of 2.4 per cent(annualised 9.6 per cent) compared to the previous quarter, but in comparison to the same quarter of last year (excluding fuel) increased by an annual rate of 12.2 per cent. Imports of consumer goods, however, rose sharply whether compared to the previous quarter or same quarter of last year. According to the former it rose by 27.2 per cent, and the latter by 56.4 per cent. This is partly a reflection of the re-direction of importers from franco valuta trade to official banking channels. But the figures also show real growth, perhaps of a substantive scale. Indeed there is, it seems, a continuation of pent-up demand from last year imported consumer goods, parallel with the high growth rate that is being registered tin the economy. It could take the whole of this year to exhaust this pent-up demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With imports poised to grow at a high rate while exports lag behind, the trade deficit in 96/97 should be expected to widen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - High level negotiations between the Dubai-based Dolphin Group and Mpumalanga provincial government on the future of Dolphin's proposed monopoly of key State-owned tourist attractions in the province are expected to be completed later today. No announcement on an amended contract will, however, be made today said Dolphin spokesperson, Mike Sharpes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin was forced into the re-negotiations by the provincial government after a wide-spread public outcry against a secret 50-year agreement between Dolphin and the Mpumalanga Parks Board (MPB) gave the controversial international company all commercial development and transverse rights to six State-owned game reserves, the entire Blyde River Canyon, Pilgrim's Rest and Loskop Dam.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPB was sworn to complete secrecy about the contract's contents for the full 50-years that the contract was in force by a special clause which was included at Dolphin's insistence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return, Dolphin undertook to pay MPB's budget deficit for 50-years and to invest at least R300-million in capital development in the region. MPB officials estimated the deal to be worth R12,2-billion to the government and possibly R55-billion to the local economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After two months of public, NGO and media objections, the provincial government intervened and sent a &quot;rescue mission&quot; to London demanding alterations to the contract to &quot;save the deal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final phase of negotiations, which began in Johannesburg on Monday and which is led by Dolphin's embattled president, Ketan Somaia, are expected to ratify a list of ten proposed significant changes to the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These changes include the exclusion of the secrecy clause, the exclusion of Pilgrim's Rest and Manyeleti Game Reserve from the deal and the cutting of the contract from 50 to 25-years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislative experts have, however, expressed concern that Dolphin has withdrawn its blanket offer to underwrite MPB's budget by pointing out that this is the only reason MPB was originally mandated to seek private sector investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga environmental affairs MEC, David Mkhwanazi, who is heading the governments delegation at the negotiations, said on Monday that he had never really supported the original contract but he was unable to say why he did not object to it sooner or why he had allowed it to be signed at all in November last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unconfirmed reports indicate that Premier Mathews Phosa paid a short visit and informal to the negotiations on Monday afternoon before flying to Mozambique where he is scheduled to visit South African farmers who have resettled in that country. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Invicta Holdings, the Cape Town distributor of agricultural and construction equipment and parts, is on line to reap bumper profits for the year ending this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a special meeting to place new shares with two institutions and increase the company's authorised capital yesterday, managing director Mike Rose-Innes said it was &quot;safe to say profits will be well up on last year&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the six months to September, Invicta saw net profits jump 102 percent to R15,1 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company is currently trading at around 500c a share, just shy of its all-time high of 520c reached just over a week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shareholders voted at the meeting in favour of issuing three million shares at an issue price of 475c a share for a total consideration of R14,25 million to Old Mutual Asset Manager and Coronation Asset Management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rose-Innes said Invicta had been approached by the two institutions about six weeks ago for new equity, and &quot;we decided to go ahead with a private placing and take some debt off our balance sheet&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We run a very conservative company in an industry where you don't want excess debt on your balance sheet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry has certainly treated Invicta well over the past two years, and the company is now eagerly eyeing the privatisation of co-operatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Privatisation of co-ops will have a very good effect on Invicta because for the first time they will have to become totally profit oriented,&quot; Mr Rose- Innes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The farmers have much more choice now and certainly our market share has in some areas has increased dramatically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps more the important side to Invicta is its construction equipment business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We bought the construction equipment business of CSE in July and, while it wasn't profitable when we bought it, it has ceased losing money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have begun to see a lot of positive signs in the construction industry - there are a lot of new contracts coming out and trading in that company is reasonable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rose-Innes said Invicta now used the same warehouse for its agricultural and construction equipment, and the CSE branches were selling agricultural equipment, and Northmec branches were selling construction equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CSE, in effect, goes from five branches to 14, and Northmec from nine branches to 14,&quot; Mr Rose-Innes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This had increased the distribution for both businesses with little effect on service because most of the engines used on both agricultural and construction equipment were the same.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The storm over Justice Minister Dullah Omar's backing for Allan Boesak as he faces a fraud trial is building, with a call for a parliamentary debate on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Omar's protestations that his support for Mr Boesak is being demonstrated in his capacity as an African National Congress provincial leader - rather than as Minister of Justice - have been rejected by opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party's Doug Gibson, who called for the parliamentary debate, said: &quot;Has Mr Omar taken leave of his senses? He has lent his support to an attack on the rule of law, with which he has been entrusted with protecting and upholding.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DP said Mr Boesak had the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. &quot;Instead of addressing the charges against him, however, Mr Boesak has chosen to present himself as a political martyr and to smear the justice system with the claim he is now fighting 'the same people' he was compelled to fight under apartheid,&quot; Mr Gibson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party spokesman Patrick McKenzie said it was clear that the &quot; struggle&quot; would be used to discredit the judiciary and the legal process, by turning the Boesak trial into an O J Simpson-style event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr McKenzie said South Africa risked being labelled a banana republic by what he termed the direct interference of the minister of justice in a legal process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP also supported the principle that a person was innocent until proven guilty. &quot;However, it seems as if the ANC and the minister of justice have already found that a person involved in the struggle is innocent and will remain so - regardless of the legal process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr McKenzie said the precedent this set would be that anyone could excuse a crime by blaming it on the struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pan Africanist Congress also expressed misgivings about ANC government members supporting Mr Boesak.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Cape Argus is 140-years old this year. And the biggest local story in it's history? Unquestionably it was Nelson Mandela's release from jail on February 11, 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that emotion-charged day, a legend was born - a beginning made in a relationship between a revered leader and his people which is probably unique in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To stay with the story and reflect all the passion, the drama, the expectation and the joy of that momentous occasion, the Cape Argus was stretched to the limit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not far behind, if only because of its element of surprise, was news of the world's first heart transplant operation, which brought international fame to Chris Barnard and Groote Schuur Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heart transplants are routine operations today. But in 1967, the world caught its collective breath at the sight of Louis Washkansky being kept alive by the beating heart of pretty Denise Darvall, who had died hours earlier in a motor accident in Main Road, Observatory - a stone's throw from the hospital. The historic heart transplant operation took place on December 3, 1967. Mr Washkansky died, from rejection, 18 days later, on December 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For sheer drama, it would be hard to beat the stranding of the vessel Seafarer on the rocks at Mouille Point during a violent winter storm on July 1, 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noel Harford, Cape Argus shipping reporter at the time, was in a deep sleep in his Rondebosch home when he was jolted awake by the ringing of the telephone. The caller was the newspaper's works manager, Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Jenkins, living then at Three Anchor Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'd better get over here fast!&quot; Jenkins said tersely, &quot;There's a great big bloody ship on the rocks, right under Mouille Point lighthouse!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When daylight came, under leaden skies, the predicament of those on board was frighteningly exposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seafarer was fast on the rocks, broadside on to gigantic winter Atlantic swells, which thudded against her hull, broke over her fo'csle and showered her superstructure with spray. The cries of the terrified people on the bridge could be clearly heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within a short time, a crowd of several thousand had gathered on the lawns at Three Anchor Bay to watch the unfolding drama. Those who came (it was before the days of television) saw one of the most dramatic rescues in South Africa's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just when it seemed that the terrified people on board would perish while thousands stood helplessly by, Alouette helicopters from the SAAF squadron at Ysterplaat arrived. Displaying breathtaking skill in the atrocious conditions the SAAF pilots lifted the marooned people, one by one, to safety on the lawns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Seafarer broke in two a short time later and Harford led the paper for a full week with his stories of the rescue and subsequent Seafarer developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The year of 1966 produced another dramatic story when, on September 6, Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd was fatally stabbed in the House of Assembly by a parliamentary messenger, Dimitrio Tsafendas. Within minutes, veteran parliamentary reporter, Tos Wentzel, was on the phone dictating the stunning news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years later, on the night of September 29, 1969, the Boland town of Tulbagh was hit by an earthquake. Several people died and the homes of many of the poorer families were reduced to rubble. The shock was felt even in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1974, the Rosenkowitz sextuplets, born on January 10, made headlines.  Their story was followed by Cape Argus as they grew into adulthood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 25, 1981, a snap message on the telex from a country correspondent was the first intimation of the disastrous flash flood that swept through Laingsburg. Immediate reaction was: &quot;Floods in Laingsburg?  What's this, then, April 1?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the news editor took the message seriously and sent off a team by car.  Pronto. As a result the Cape Argus was well placed to report on the appalling devastation caused when a &quot;wall of water&quot; thundered down a normally dry Buffels River after a freak cloudburst some distance away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the apartheid years the Cape Argus - described by State President PW Botha as being &quot;beyond redemption&quot; under the editorship of John O'Malley - reported the heroic struggle of disenfranchised people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stories that made headlines included the notorious Trojan Horse incident on October 15, 1985, when police sharpshooters, hiding in a railway truck, opened fire in Thornton Road, Athlone, killing three young people and wounding 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are only some of the Big Stories of the last 50 years, not to mention reports that made headlines in the 90 years before that. Or any of the big international stories of the past 140 years - Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon, for one.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - I'm grappling to settle on a topic for this week's column when my telephone rings and by the tone I recognise it as an internal call. It's our security desk downstairs telling me that there's a Philip wanting to speak to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip is a vendor for the Big Issue, the new magazine which has hit the streets of Cape Town to provide homeless and long-term unemployed people with a dignified alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Big Issue follows in the footsteps of its famous London counterpart which helps people on the street earn a living by allowing them to keep a portion of the cover price of the magazine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Town project has the full backing of its London sister publication, which is rooting for its success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here vendors keep R2 of the R3,50 selling price and they're expected to buy their own stock after a start-up allocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip, who is 68 and came to Cape Town for an eye operation, has come to deliver a complimentary copy of the second edition of the Big Issue to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is after after an article which appeared in the Cape Argus about a month ago about the magazine and its operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip's had the eye operation (the hospital called him the day after the article was published) and he's ready to hit the streets with his bag bulging with the latest edition of the Big Issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a glorious day outside and, with his upbeat attitude, he's bound to do good business as he heads towards St George's Mall, his trade-mark green hat planted firmly on his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A good portion of his market is likely to be the tourist trade, people who recognise the title from the streets of London and who know the philosophy behind it. The residents of Cape Town are fast catching on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am deeply touched that someone in Philip's position is able to make the gesture of giving away a free copy for the purposes of promoting the product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It speaks volumes for what the Big Issue project is all about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I didn't tell Philip was that I had already procured the latest edition of the Big Issue from a vendor the day before and it struck me, as I paid over the money and looked the seller in the eye, that this was a venture that deserved the support of every Capetonian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How often before have I averted my eyes from people on the streets because they make me feel uncomfortable?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By paying over money for something I want, even my body language changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, I accepted Philip's gift in the spirit it was offered, and resolved in the lift on the way back to the newsroom to use it to promote the cause - hence this column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You see, by backing something like the Big Issue, you have nothing to lose and the city as a whole has everything to gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies which give advertising or in-kind donations can honestly claim that they are putting their money where their mouths are by supporting a social upliftment initiative, instead of simply complaining about the problems on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who buy the magazine will know that their money is going directly to people who find themselves on the proverbial skid-row, but who have taken the conscious decision to help themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Big Issue's credo is &quot;A Hand Up, Not a Hand Out&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then, to boot, you will discover that the Big Issue is a professionally produced and highly readable product which has some interesting, off-beat and well-written stories along with listings of arts and culture events in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ideally, those behind the project are hoping that the magazine will virtually sell itself because of the content, and the vendors will happily have no trouble in finding buyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Street people have been in the news again recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are accused of robbing city coffers by vandalising parking meters (although one can't help wondering to what extent a rudderless traffic department has contributed to the parking debacle).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are the stories of robbed tourists and the recent arrest of a gang of suspects whom the police described as street kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally, there's the Chamber of Commerce and Industry's proposal to legislate against sleeping in doorways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a South Africa filled with impoverished people and in a region where alcoholism is an unquantified social problem, we have to accept that there is no short supply of people trying to earn a living on the streets - whether they sleep there or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, the solutions lie in finding economic alternatives for those who can be helped, lobbying for the social programmes and day-centres which can provide shelter for those who might be too damaged to be able to help themselves, and dealing with crime firmly and fairly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Anti-apartheid cleric Allan Boesak returned to South Africa to a tumultuous welcome - and a fresh controversy involving the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The past is still so closely with us that there is a danger of it being exploited with relative ease. In a country where, within our recent memories, political trials were illegitimate and punitive, it is a simple matter to invoke that era in the cause of confusion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what appears to be happening in the case of the Rev Allan Boesak, on trial for fraud. The controversial cleric and important figure in the resistance movement of the 1980s is quite within his rights to argue his innocence, but so is the public within its rights in questioning his broader assertions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boesak says it is the struggle against apartheid which is on trial, and we say that is manifestly not true. He is on trial, and not for his politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is where the recent statements of Justice Minister Dullah Omar become problematic. He has at the very least given the impression to the public that he - and by implication the party he represents - has concluded that Boesak is innocent. There is a nobility in refusing to ditch former comrades, but there are limits too: it would be one thing if Omar expressed the hope in his personal capacity that the courts would clear Boesak, entirely another if he appears to pre-empt their findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is quite wrong for the media, or anyone else, to try someone in public before due process has taken place. This newspaper has studiously avoided stoking hysteria in its coverage of the Boesak case. But it is equally wrong, especially in the democratic South Africa, for major public figures to prematurely declare innocence without adding the rider that they will abide by the decisions of the courts. These courts are now people's courts in the proper sense of the word: let them do their work and let us discuss their findings once they are made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team, which includes police, the Defence Force, traffic authorities and provincial political leaders, is to embark on a so-called &quot;broken window&quot; approach to root out violence and crime in the minibus taxi industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highly successful anti-crime strategy, pioneered in New York recently, entails following up even the smallest violation (for example, breaking a window), which, it is believed, eventually leads to the elimination of bigger crimes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows a shootout between members of the Defence Force and taxi drivers in Nyanga yesterday in which two men were killed and a woman was seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conflict started after the soldiers arrested a taxi driver, during a routine anti-crime operation, for allegedly being in possession of an illegal firearm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting was condemned by Western Cape premier Hernus Kriel, provincial Police Minister Gerald Morkel, Transport Minister Leonard Ramatlakane and the mayors of the Cape Town and Tygerberg councils, Theresa Solomon and Lukas Olivier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a joint statement, they said taxi violence necessitated firm action and announced the formation of a special task group comprising police, soldiers and traffic officers to help the provincial task team on taxi violence, which was established last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We as political office bearers...are serious about efforts to stamp out lawlessness and to bring about an effectively regulated taxi industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Flagrant violations of the law must come to an end and will not be tolerated,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Ministry spokesman David Frost said the new anti-crime campaign plan required all those involved to take part in a multi-agency approach, which would be used to address the situation and enforce the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Frost said the implementation of the plan in Cape Town would need the support of the authorities and specifically that of taxi commuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are investigating the Nyanga shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear who fired the fatal shots, but ballistic results are expected later today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - The National Expertise Commission (CNE) on precious stones of Zaire believes that more than one third of Zaire's diamond production worth about 300 million dollars are smuggled out each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to European diamond dealers, between 300 and 400 million dollars worth of diamond are smuggled out of Zaire every year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission based its statement on the fact that although diamond mining was on the upswing in the Kasai area, official production figures slumped from 9.5 million carats in 1990 to 4.8 million carats in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To redress the situation, the Zairian government has arrested a number of black market diamond dealers in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the CNE, 500,000 people live directly or indirectly from the smuggling of precious metals in the Zairian region of Kasai.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - A Kenyan linguist attending a three-day meeting on African language policies in Harare on Tuesday proposed the establishment of a thesaurus on African languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting a paper at the inter-governmental conference on language policies in Africa, the Kenyan delegate said it was likely that all present day languages originated from Africa either as hieroglyphics or phoenician and later progressed as Greek and other European languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expert said linguists had a huge task because of the existence of tens of thousands of different languages in the world today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said some African countries such as Nigeria had over 400 different languages and yet only three, Hausa, Ibo and Yoruba were national languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan expert, however, expressed hope that a thesaurus of African languages could be established by the next generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope as experts gathered here today we can reach an agreement and form an association for linguistics and comparative linguistics or establish a university of linguistics as well, which could probably be funded by UNESCO so that as Africans we could slowly realize our dream,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Africa was a paradise for linguistics and comparative linguistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other delegates to the conference highlighted the use of African languages as the best way of ensuring participation of Africans in society as well as in the planning and management of development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference is expected to examine and adopt a document to serve as a reference framework for a ministerial conference which begins here on Thursday to evaluate language policies and practices in member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 30 African and European countries are represented at the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the conference on Monday, Zimbabwe's education minister Gabriel Machinga said african languages had been relegated to the background because of historical situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said recommendations by the experts would constitute a landmark in African thinking as to which direction africans ought to take on the language issue, given the complexities of the different situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machinga said the discussions by the experts would also contribute towards the production of a language atlas, which would be a useful tool for Africans to chart new paths in the area of policy formulation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A Zambian journalist, serving a three month jail term for contempt of court, on Tuesday withdrew an apology he had made to the Supreme Court in February, saying it had acted unfairly in handling his case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during the opening of his appeal in Lusaka, Masautso Phiri, News Editor of the privately-owned Post newspaper, said that he had apologized not because he was guilty, but because of his recognition of the Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phiri was on Feb. 11 charged with contempt of court and consequently jailed for three months, for publishing an article which purported that in November 1996, seven Supreme Court judges were bribed by the state to throw out a petition filed by the opposition parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties complained about President Frederick Chiluba's nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had alleged that the judges were paid one million U.S. dollars each by the state to dismiss a petition in which the opposition parties are challenging last November's presidential and general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his apology last February, Phiri expressed regret and apologized to the court for his &quot;erroneous&quot; article which, he said, was not meant to ridicule the bench.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reversing that position Tuesday, Phiri, who is partly representing himself, said that had he been given a chance to make a plea, he could have pleaded not guilty and taken the line of defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What transpired on February 10, without even giving me chance to take a plea made my heart bleed and I wondered what was happening to the integrity of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a journalist, we must be partners with the judiciary in monitoring democracy and good governance in this country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was also withdrawing his apology because it would serve no purpose, since even when he had offered to apologize, judge Matthew Chaila had told him that even if he apologized he would not accept his apology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phiri has also demanded the withdraw of three of the seven judges who heard his case because of the differences he has had with them during the course of his duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that his relations with judges Chaila, David Lewanika and the Deputy Chief Justice Bornaventure Bweupe were not good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He applied to be granted bail, in the interest of justice, so that he can defend himself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Uganda Coffee exports dropped by 10 percent to 496, 378 bags in February, The government-owned New Vision newspaper reported Tuesday, quoting officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It quoted the Uganda Coffee Development Authority monthly report released last week as saying the drop was due to the scaling down of the coffee season in central and eastern Uganda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decline in international prices during the first quarter (October- December) was also blamed for the drop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said during the period, farmers sold large quantities of coffee stocks in order to meet their financial needs. This depleted stocks at the farm level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in spite of the drop in exports, prices paid to farmers in February increased drastically, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average price for Kiboko rose from 500 shillings a kilo in January to between 600 shillings and 700 shillings per kilo at the end of February (1, 000 shillings = 1 USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Fair Average Quality coffee prices ranged between 1,300 shillings and 1,450 shillings a kilo and Arabica parchment 1,600 shillings and 1,700 shillings per kilo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said the slight improvement in prices in the coffee market led to an increase in sales registration during the month. Sales made during February totalled 743,431 up from 522,253 bags in January, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cumulatively, exports during the first five months of the 1996/97 season reached 2.3 million bags worth 173.6 million U.S. dollars, compared to 1.8 million bags valued 185.4 million dollars realized in the same period last season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This represents an aggregate rise in volume of 25.1 percent and 6.39 percent drop in value.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerian head of state Sani Abacha has said that noticeable lapses from Saturday's multi-party council elections would be corrected in future polls under the military regime's transition to democracy programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exchanging views Monday with a 38-member election monitors from the United States in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, he described the polls as &quot;a cornerstone&quot; to the transition programme, scheduled to end October 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No elections in any part of the world, including the United States could be perfect and hitch-free,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the team, representing the Autonomous America for Democracy in Africa, the American Bar Association and the Congress of Racial Equality, said they monitored voting in 63 polling centers in different parts of the country, including Abuja, Lagos and the western city of Ibadan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha told them to be objective in their appraisal and to shun sensation, adding that independent assessments would help the government to correct mistakes and prepare for future challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He restated his commitment to the transition programme and said it was regrettable that some countries had chosen to castigate and refused to recognize his government's democratization efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha urged the United States to abandon its cold disposition towards Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have always regarded America as our friend and we equally expect the United States to be closer and be of assistance to Nigeria in her time of crisis,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described his administration's transition programme as &quot;absolutely transparent with no hidden agenda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their individual assessments, the poll monitors generally agreed that Saturday's elections &quot;were free and fair as there were no deliberate attempts from any quarters to either intimidate voters or cause any disturbances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said they observed mainly logistic problems in the conduct of the polls, especially late arrival of materials to polling stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the future, the group suggested extensive training of electoral officers and the setting up of arbitration teams to go round and settle on- the-spot problems that could arise during INL002 from SSS.078 (970318-17:09) QN PANAINL .PANADKR MSG077G/02E PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PAN(2) balloting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, preliminary results from the elections showed that the United Nigerian Congress Party continued to lead four other rivals across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress was reported to have clinched at least 230 council/chairmanship seats, with strong showing in Lagos, the northern states of Katsina, Niger, Borno, Kaduna; the eastern state of Enugu, the southeastern state of Akwa Ibom and the western states of Ogun, Ekiti, and Ondo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party of Nigeria is second. It has some 128 council/chairmanship seats with impressive performance in the western states of Oyo and Osun, the northern states of Kano and Sokoto and the eastern state of Imo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Center Party of Nigeria, along with the Grassroots Democratic Party and the Congress for National Consensus are trailing. They have run- off/by-elections planned in at 147 councils or wards, where polls were either cancelled, failed to take place or were stalemated Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 8,000 councillorship and chairmanship seats were at stake from the 776 councils in the 36 states within the federation, with an estimated 56 million eligible voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian newspapers reported Tuesday that four election-related deaths were recorded in the southeastern state of rivers and midwestern state of Delta between Saturday and Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no official confirmation of the deaths, which reportedly occurred over electoral disputes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Police from Mozambican, South Africa and Zimbabwe have seized 344 apparently stolen cars in joint operations that began in January, the Maputo daily newspaper, Noticias, reported Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Raul Freia, a superintendent in the Mozambican Police Public Relations Department, 221 of the vehicles were recovered in Mozambique.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">All were apparently stolen in South Africa and most of them are four wheel drive vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zimbabwe, 92 vehicles were seized. Freia said that five of these had been stolen in Mozambique. He did not know the origin of the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, the police recovered 31 cars, all of which had been stolen in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freia said that the number of cars to be returned to their legitimate owners could rise, since the operation had not yet finished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He confirmed what many Mozambicans have been saying ever since the operation began Jan. 25: that in some cases the real crime was not car theft but insurance fraud. In such cases, South Africans sell their cars in neighbouring countries, wait a few weeks and then report them stolen and claim the insurance money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the operation, one South African, whom Freia named as Van der Back, was caught red-handed in just such a fraud. He sold a car in Mozambique, then reported it to South African Police as stolen. But the Mozambican buyer was able to identify Van der Back, who is now under police custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freia said that people falsely reporting their cars as stolen would face &quot; severe penalties.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UGANDA, KAMPALA (PANA) - Uganda's first stock exchange, expected to take of within the next couple of months, will assist in the divestiture of loss- making and poorly-managed public enterprises through public flotations, Ministry of Finance officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the state-run Capital Markets Authority, Leo Kibirango, said last week the long-awaited Kampala Stock Exchange will begin business within one to two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former governor of the (central) Bank of Uganda, Kibirango made the announcement during a two-hour news conference on the licensing of seven stock brokerage firms/dealers and investment advisers. These would be authorized to deal in the buying and selling of stocks and shares.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the authority's statute, a minimum of three competing stock brokers are needed to establish a limited liability company which would be licensed to establish the stock exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ball is now in the court of the licensed brokers to put their act together and apply for permission to launch the long-awaited stock exchange,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formation of the exchange, he said, would be a private sector initiative.  Therefore, its launching would depend on how soon the players make their request to the authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excited by the news, the executive director of the Enterprise Development Project under the privatization department, Leonard Muganwa, said: &quot;The Kampala Stock Exchange will quicken the pace of privatization and economic reform and make the country more attractive to interested investors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exchange, he added, will also &quot;provide a venue for the prospective market professionals to be partners in building Uganda's future,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 20 major enterprises are targeted for divestiture through public flotations within the next two three years. They include some of the country's most potentially profitable enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies to be privatized through public flotation include, the Uganda Commercial Bank, Uganda Posts and Telecommunication Corporation, Uganda Grain Milling Company, Deffe Marketing Board, Uganda Consolidation Properties Limited, Uganda Airlines Corporation, National Insurance Corporation and the National Housing and Construction Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to public criticism that public enterprises were being sold to foreigners and big magnates and that the small man was not having a stake in the &quot;national cake,&quot; the government decided to introduce the method of public flotations of shares in government owned firms which could be picked up and bought by small businessmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under public flotation, a strategic investor would be allowed to buy majority shares of 51 percent in a given enterprise in order to provide the much needed initial capital, management skills and technical know-how as well as technology transfer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining shares would be offered to the general public either through off-the-counter transactions or sold through the stock exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public flotation method will go a long way in removing anxiety among the general public that the national cake was going entirely to foreigners,&quot; said Anne Bwomezi, the information officer of the Privatization Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will also democratize ownership and management of these enterprises,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank inspired privatization of public enterprises was meant to have covered about 85 percent before the end of 1997. But has been delayed partly because of the delays in the take-off of the country's stock exchange and the criticisms levelled against the measure by some vocal politicians, parliamentarians and individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its inauguration in May 1996, the authority's board of directors has worked out a plan aimed at achieving three major objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the creation of an institutional framework within which the demand and supply of securities will be managed and facilitation of financial intermediation in the economy, the promotion of investor confidence through the establishment of a regulatory regime for the securities industry in order to protect investor interests, particularly those of the small investor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authority's board is also aiming at the promotion of a regional East African Stock Market by cooperating with the capital markets authorities in Kenya and Tanzania, with the major aim of standardizing the regulatory market procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This would facilitate cross border listings of shares and would also provide adequate levels of liquidity in the market to attract foreign investor capital,&quot; Sarah Walusimbi, of the authority, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attraction of highly experienced and reputable brokerage firms to form a stock exchange was recognized by the authority's board as one of its priority tasks in the work plan, according to Kibirango.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the first seven brokerage firms to be licensed had to fulfil the criteria of character, competence and possession of adequate capital to provide financial services to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the brokerage firms licensed, so far, is the African Alliance Uganda Limited. It is a subsidiary of the Capital Alliance Holding Company of South Africa with a capitalization of 300 millions U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When established the Kampala Stock Exchange will join 16 other active African equity markets with a combined value of 260 billion dollars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (PANA) - As rebels continue to make territorial gains in eastern Zaire, the country's High Council of the Republic, that is, the Transitional parliament has voted a motion to remove Prime Minister Leon Kengo Wa Dondo from office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Zaire reported on Wednesday that the premier was sacked because of his &quot;incompetence&quot; in dealing with the war being waged by Laurent Desire Kabila's Democratic Alliance for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the radio, monitored in Brazzaville, Congo, his departure was &quot; massively&quot; endorsed by members of parliament during an extraordinary session on Tuesday night. The law makers accused him of failing in his mission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parliament also called for the negotiations with &quot;the enemy&quot; (the ADLC rebels) but ruled that the peace talks should not be conducted by Kengo's government. Kengo was elected prime minister in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well informed sources in Brazzaville said the cabinet was expected to meet on Wednesday to review the political situation after the removal of the prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cabinet session will be held in the absence of Kengo, who has travelled to Nairobi, Kenya, to attend the Great Lakes summit on the Zairean crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another move, deputies who attended Tuesday's parliamentary session expressed their intention to recall Mgr. Laurent Monsengwo, the former speaker who was elected by the country's National Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Roman Catholic bishop was dismissed two years ago by a parliamentary coalition of supporters of President Mobutu, Kengo and Etienne Tshisekedi's radical opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress abstained from the vote to oust Kengo, on the ground that the legitimate prime minister was still Tshisekedi, who was elected by the National Conference in December 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on Tuesday morning, travellers from Kinshasa said there was great panic among people in the Zairean capital. after the capture of Kisangani, the country's third largest town, by Kabila's troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairperson of the Congolese Red Cross, Ida Victorine Nze, revealed Tuesday that members of the Mobutu family had fled to Brazzaville. Among the refugees is Mobutu's son, Capt. Kongolu Mobutu, sources said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A diplomatic source said small groups of U.S. nationals have also arrived in Brazzaville from Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Brazzaville-based World Health Organization (WHO) regional office for Africa has launched a 20-year plan of action to speed up the elimination of female genital mutilation (FMG) which reportedly affects some 100 million women on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unveiling the plan on Monday, the WHO Regional Director for Africa, Ebrahim Malick Samba, said his office was committed to assuming a leading coordinating role as &quot;WHO's campaign against the practice of female genital mutilation cannot be compromised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A news release during the occasion said the 50-page regional plan seeks to boost country activities for the prevention and elimination of FGM and other harmful traditional practices which affect the health of women and children in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Female genital mutilation or female circumcision is a general term used to describe the cutting of the internal or external parts of the female sex organs with sharp objects for reasons which are not medical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is performed on infants, young girls between the ages of five and 10 years, adolescents and even older women of childbearing age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some African cultures, the practice is regarded as an obligatory rite for a girl's transition from childhood to adulthood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the practice is often carried out without anaesthesia by mostly village women or traditional midwives, or in some cases, male barbers, under unhygienic conditions, its effects on the health of women and children have been devastating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practice is associated with negative health consequences such as pain, shock, bleeding, urinary tract infections and the risk of blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis B and the HIV, which causes the incurable acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO plan to accelerate the elimination of the practice in the next two decades is in phases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first short-term phase, covering 1996-98, is estimated to cost 2.1 million U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there will be an eight-year medium term (1999-2006) to be followed by a nine-year long term (2007-2015) implementation periods, which are to be developed and costed separately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan of action, to be undertaken in collaboration with partners at national and international levels, aims to reduce the practice by 40 percent in the number of females undergoing FGM in the 1-20 years age group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another objective is to increase by 55 percent, the number of countries implementing supportive programmes aimed at stopping the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 27 of the 46 WHO member countries covered by the regional office practice FGM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zaire and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

This body is a branch of the civil service, with the possibility of an appeal against the secretariat's decisions to the Constitutional Council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mozambican constitution decrees that it is the Constitutional Council that supervises elections. But the council has never been established. So, its functions are exercised, on an interim basis, by the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the debate, opposition deputies objected to this scheme. They demanded the establishment of a National Elections Commission as an &quot; intermediate body,&quot; in between the secretariat and the Constitutional Council/Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue was remitted to the assembly's Commission on Agriculture and Public Administration, and this eventually produced a unanimous opinion that such an intermediate body should be created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its proposal was for a nine member National Elections Commission, whose chairman would be &quot;a person of recognized moral and professional integrity, who can provide guarantees of impartiality, and who will be appointed by the president of the republic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven members of the commission (also persons &quot;of recognized moral and professional integrity&quot;) will be elected by the assembly, on a basis &quot; proportional to parliamentary representation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This should mean that the majority Frelimo party will choose four of them and the opposition benches the remaining three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ninth member of the commission will be &quot;a technical expert appointed by the government.&quot; In addition, the director of the secretariat will be allowed to attend meetings of the commission but without the right to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government has agreed to draft a bill establishing the National Elections Commission along these lines and will deposit it with the assembly by the end of this week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Former Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister Tamrat Layne, who was fired in 1996, has been charged with abuse of power along with eight other alleged accomplices, the ministry of justice said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that he was due to appear in the Federal Supreme Court next week in Addis Ababa on three counts of abuse of power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alleged accomplices include a government official believed to be one- time aide and secretary to Tamrat, and seven alleged business associates. No names were given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement also gave no further details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamrat was fired Oct. 24 from his post of deputy prime minister and minister of defence. He was also stripped of his seat in the federal parliament and his post as secretary-general of his party, the Amhara National Democratic Movement, and as deputy chairman of the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Democratic Revolutionary Front coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night he was sacked, Tamrat appeared on state television admitting to fellow parliamentarians that he was guilty of &quot;gross misconduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was resigning his post &quot;for acting contrary to the principles for which his party, the ANDM, had stood for over a decade and a half.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, the party informed the ruling coalition of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to inform the federal parliament of Tamrat's sacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamrat's party, one of the four ethnic-based parties in the coalition, played a key role in the armed struggle, spearheaded by Meles' Tigray People's Liberation Front, to oust former dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in May 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamrat was named Ethiopia's prime minister during the country's transition period from 1991 to 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a new federal constitution and Ethiopia's first multiparty elections in 1995, he was named deputy prime minister and minister of defence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria has initiated moves to send detectives to Britain and the United states in pursuit of investigations into recent bomb blasts in the country, the inspector-general of police, Ibrahim Coomassie, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told journalists in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, Tuesday that the country was particularly keen on following the investigations in the United States because of a recent state department warning about bomb blasts in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to know how they (U.S.) knew about it (the bombings),&quot; he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state department in a widely publicized statement warned U.S. nationals in Nigeria and those planning to visit the country of likely bomb blasts in Lagos between December 1996 and Jan. 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the period, no fewer than three bomb blasts occurred in Lagos, all targeted against the military and killed at least three people. The authorities have blamed the country's opposition groups, some of whose members are self-exiled in Europe and the United States, for the bomb explosions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coomassie did not say whether the investigation would involve interrogation of Nigerian exiles in the U.S. or Britain, charged last week in a Lagos magistrate's court with treason in connection with the bomb blasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 16 people were charged, four in absentia, since they are exiled abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include nobel literature laureate Wole Soyinka, former chief of army staff Lt. Gen. (rtd) Alani Akinrinade and opposition National Democratic Coalition leader Anthony Enahoro. They have in separate statements from their bases in either U.K. or U.S. denied the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coomassie did not explain if these countries would cooperate with Nigeria on the extradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has mutual legal assistance accords with the United States and Britain on drug related issues. But it was unclear if this could be extended to include other criminal cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic sources in Lagos said the countries would likely feel reluctant to cooperate if the case had to do with politics, especially with their cool diplomatic relations with Nigeria over democracy and human rights issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. and European countries have maintained a regime of limited sanctions on Nigeria since the return of military rule following the annulment of the 1993 presidential election by the last military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measures were toughened in the aftermath of the November 1995 execution for murder of nine Nigerian minority leaders, among them, author Ken Saro- Wiwa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa (ENA) - A prosecution witness yesterday told the Federal High Court that Derg investigators used to entertain at Sodere after they throw into pits corpses gathered from various prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness, then a driver of the Central Investigation said he had transported many corpses from the Central Investigation and a detention centre known as &quot;Bermuda&quot; to the Kotebe Teacher Training College and saw the bodies put in grave dug earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness, now a pensioner, also said he had found his car stained with blood, adding that he also saw many other corpses burried into newly dug pits.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clothes of the deceased which the witness, 50 claims to have transported from the Central Investigation to the college were also set on fire over the graves few days after the execution of the prisoners, he told the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that he had witnessed investigation heads and their colleagues entertaining at Sodere for they were presumably tired of burying corpses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other witnesses, then members of the Prisons Administration, have also testified that they, under the order of chiefs, had brought about 20 prisoners from Kombolcha in October 1986 and handed over them to then heads of the Addis Ababa Central Investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three witnesses of the prosecutor who said has spent long years in &quot;Bermuda&quot; and other prison cells since 1976 EC explained to the court overall situation of the prisons including torture devices and mechanisms used by their tormentors. They also displayed the bodily harm they had received during the torture and named other prisoners who did not return after being called out of their cells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness who said was taken away from her work place, Addis Ababa University in July 1969 E.C. had suffered long hours of torture with her limbs bound rightly, blind folded and mouth gagged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she had languished in different prison cells before her release in 1973 E.C. for allegedly being a member of the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Party (EPRP) and s spy for the C.I.A. She also called out the names of five inmates including a-14-year-old girl who did not return after being taken away from the prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Special Prosecutor has requested the court to see for itself the mass grave in the Kotebe Teacher Training College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial was adjourned until tomorrow, March 20, 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa (ENA) - The general manager of the Ethiopian Investment Authority says the nation's call for investment has been met with &quot; satisfactory&quot; response from both domestic and foreign entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with Merewa, a magazine published by the Press and Information Department in the Ministry of Information and Culture, Ato Tadesse Haile, said favourable conditions have been created fro entrepreneurs to invest their capital in the various fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incentives the Investment Code offers has attracted more and more local as well as foreign entrepreneurs to engage in different sectors, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts are being exerted to show to the world the immense resources and wide-range of investment opportunities the country has at its disposal, the general manager told the bilingual magazine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A thirty-minute documentary video film has been produced on Ethiopia, he said, and indicated that it is being distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Tadesse indicated that 3,186 domestic and foreign investment projects with a combined capital of 22.3 billion birr and creating employment for 169, 846 people were approved up until December 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said 1610 of the projects were certified by the authority while the remaining were given licences by the regional investment offices, Ministry of Mining and Energy and the National Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manager said 541 projects with a capital of 3.5 billion birr and employing 22,548 people had already been put into effect up to June 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 524 projects creating job opportunities for 29,655 people are in their implementation phase, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the total projects, forty are owned by foreign investors, he said, and pointed out that seven of these which cost 197.6 million birr have already been implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Tadesse further indicated that three of the projects are in the industrial sector, one in the field of agriculture, two in construction and one in the area of mining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said nine additional foreign investment projects with a capital of 170 million birr will soon begin operation in the field of mining.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa (ENA) - Students' associations to be set up at the Addis Ababa University and other schools, besides working for the respect of the rights of their members, should encourage students to understand prevalent social problems and engage in development activities, Speaker of the House of Peoples' Representatives has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Dawit Yohannis, who was a member of the leadership of the University.  Students' Union of Addis Ababa (USUAA) during the reign of Emperor Haile- Silassie, has said that &quot;this generation should give priority to development activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said students' associations, in addition to their effort for the respect of academic freedom, should also create a forum through which they could raise the political awareness of their members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The improvement in political awareness would also help students appreciate the development problems of the public which later would enable graduates to be active participants in development endeavours, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As students have already begun participating in development activities during summer vacations, they would understand the development problems of the country,&quot; the House Speaker added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle awaiting the new generation in development the country demands no less commitment than the fight waged against dictators, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling the activities of USUAA - Ato Dawit said the work of the union had helped most of the students raised in towns to understand the severity of tenancy and national oppression in rural Ethiopia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union was also a source of inspiration to continue the struggle in various directions, the House Speaker added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the struggle was conceived during the time when Ethiopians had no right to assemble, he said, students took to streets to agitate the people to fight for their freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tagel a publication of the union, was also a good forum to broaden the scope of understanding of the general public, Ato Dawit explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Dawit, who then was nicknamed as &quot;bodyguard of USUAA&quot; - said the union emerged stronger after Tilahun Gizaw assumed the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transitional council of students, set up last year at the Addis Ababa University, has reported the preparation of a statute vital for the establishment of the council proper that would take part in academic, and administrative affairs of the university.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - While the humanitarian situation throughout the Great Lakes region remains precarious, the United Nations appealed to-day for US$ 324.5 million to meet the emergency humanitarian needs of over 1.4 million refugees, internally-displaced persons and returnees affected by the ongoing emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for the Great Lakes Emergency, prepared by the United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations operational in the region, covers the period January to December 1997. Programmes and activities within the Appeal will address emergency humanitarian needs for 460,000 internally-displaced people and refugees in Zaire, 615,000 internally-displaced people and refugees in Burundi, 326,000 in Tanzania, 33,000 in Uganda and Zambia. Acting on the specific request by the Government of Rwanda, humanitarian requirements for Rwanda are not included in this regional Great Lakes Appeal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Eastern Zaire, the conflict between the Government and rebel forces continues to have a devastating impact upon innocent civilians as it spreads deeper into the interior of the country. Hundreds of thousands of Rwandan and Burundian refugees remain unaccounted for and the number of war-affected and internally displaced nationals within Zaire has grown considerably. In Burundi, over a million people have been uprooted and tens of thousands killed in the civil war and violence that has engulfed that country. Tanzania, facing pressure from the presence of a remaining caseload of Rwandan and Burundian refugees within its borders, and Uganda, which is threatened by a spill-over of the crisis, are also adversely affected by developments in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to respond rapidly and adequately to the fluid situation, projects within the Appeal have been drawn up on a regional basis in a manner which allows material and human resources to be transferred at short notice to where there is the greatest need. The main requests are for US$ 116 million for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), US$ 145.5 million for the World Food Programme (WFP), US$ 35 million for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), US$ 8.5 million for the World Health Organization (WHO), and US$ 8.1 million for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assistance sought from the international community will be aimed at preventing suffering, promoting voluntary repatriation of Rwandan refugees and providing sufficient assistance to enable internally-displaced and conflict-affected persons to return to normal economic and social standards of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community is now faced with one of the worst humanitarian crises and is calling upon donors to respond generously and without delay to this appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Zairian soldiers retreating from the country's Kivu region have pillaged, raped and killed with virtual impunity in recent months, with people in many towns and villages living in constant fear that they will become the next victims of such human rights violations, Amnesty International said in a report released today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fears have escalated in the past month, after the government launched a military counter-offensive to recapture territory lost to the L'Alliance des forces democratiques poiur la liberationa du Congo-Zaire (AFDL), Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As evidence of brutal human rights violations mounts and military actions are stepped up, we are calling on the international community to put pressure on the Zairian government now to stop further human rights violations by its security forces,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the mass exodus of refugees at the end of last year, the human rights situation in Zaire has fallen off the international agenda. Other governments have appeared unwilling or unable to take action to help people suffering gross human rights abuses in Zaire and plans for a humanitarian intervention force foundered after the forced repatriation of refugees to Rwanda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women, members of religious groups and non-Zairians, many of Rwandese or Burundian origin, have been among those specifically targeted by Zairian troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 5 or 6 December , according to several local sources, soldiers of the Forces armes zairoises (FAZ), Zairian Armed Forces, brutally raped school girls at the Lycie Likovi secondary school in Bunia. The soldiers are alleged to have raped the young girls savagely and systematically, leaving seven of them dead. In a similar event, a witness reporting that FAZ soldiers who went to Bunia raped and kidnapped young girls in late November, said: &quot;This has turned disgust with FAZ to bitter hatred&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Church workers have come under sustained attack, with local officials in Kisangani accusing the church of collaborating with the rebellion. Church buildings have been repeatedly searched or looted, and church personnel have been harassed and intimidated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the start of the conflict in eastern Zaire, the Zairian authorities have detained Zairians of Tutsi ethnic origin, refugees, journalists and human rights activists who have tried to investigate abuses against Tutsi or speak out against government policies in the conflict zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kisangani, capital of Haut Zaire region, at least 80 Rwandese and Burundian prisoners were being held 'for their own safety' since November 1996 in detention centres run by the Service national d'intelligence et de protection (SNIP), National Intelligence and Protection Service. Unconfirmed reports say that they may have been transferred to the remote Osio prison, 17 km from Kisangani, where conditions are appalling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International has appealed directly to the Zairian Prime Minister to release these people immediately if they have not been charged with recognizable criminal offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early January, the Minister of Defence, General Likulia Bolongo, announced that the armed forces have to rid themselves of &quot;criminals, runaways, pillagers and vagabonds&quot;. This announcement led to the arrest of scores of soldiers on charges of looting and desertion. On 21 January, 14 soldiers were sentenced to death by court martial in Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization believes that the death penalty is an inhumane violation of the fundamental right to life and has therefore appealed to the Zairian Government to have these death sentences commuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International calls on the Zairian Government to ensure that its forces respect the human rights of the unarmed civilians -- including the displaced and refugees -- in the conflict zones and elsewhere. The organization is also asking both the Zairian Government and the AFDL to allow full access to territories under their control to human rights activists and others investigating reports of human rights violations in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government around the world should also prevent further transfers of light weapons and associated military equipment, as well as military personnel, to the government forces and to the armed groups in the region,&quot; the organization said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News Service 24/97 AI INDEX: AFR 47/10/97 RWANDA: AMNESTY DELEGATES BACK FROM RWANDA REPORT NEW WAVE OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been a significant increase in incidents of human rights abuses in Rwanda since the forced mass repatriation of refugees from Zaire and Tanzania in November and December 1996, an Amnesty International delegation returning from a visit to Rwanda said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation reported a series of worrying developments, including an increase in unlawful executions by the Rwandese Patriotic Army (RPA) -- especially in the context of reprisal operations, deliberate and arbitrary killings of civilians by armed groups believed to be composed of soldiers of the former Rwandese army and interahamwe militia, killings of Hutu civilians by Tutsi civilians and &quot;disappearances&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been killings in Rwanda on an almost daily basis, especially in the northern and western regions, and several hundred people are estimated to have been killed since the beginning of the year -- the majority unarmed civilians including young children,&quot; the Amnesty International delegates said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The northwestern region of Ruhengeri has been especially affected by the recent upsurge in human rights abuses. For example, in Kinigi, at least 20 Tutsi civilians were killed on 25 January by armed men believed to be soldiers of the former Rwandese army or militia. The following day, at least 140 people lost their lives in what is believed to have been a reprisal attack by Tutsi civilians in the presence of RPA soldiers who appeared to do nothing to protect the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the killing of three Spanish members of the organization Medecins du Monde in Ruhengeri on 18 January, scores of unarmed civilians were reportedly killed by RPA soldiers during military search operations in the surrounding areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 4 January, in Nkumba -- also in Ruhengeri -- at least 55 unarmed civilians were reportedly killed by RPA soldiers after they surrounded a house where there were suspected infiltrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 60 returnees from Tanzania were beaten to death by Tutsi civilians in two separate incidents in Rusumo, in the eastern region of Kibungo, in mid January. Some of the bodies were reportedly found in ditches, others in latrines. Several people have reportedly been arrested in connection with the killings. In a separate incident, in the same area and around the same period, approximately 20 people were reported &quot;disappeared&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutsi families as well as Hutus believed to be collaborating with the current authorities in denouncing infiltrators have been targeted by groups allied to the former Rwandese army. For example, in Taba, Rural Kigali, around 20 people were killed in two separate incidents on 23 December and 5 January. On 9 February, at least 11 Tutsis were reportedly shot dead after being forced to get out of vehicles on the road at Tare, also in Rural Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several members of the former Rwandese army recently returned from Zaire have also been killed, in some cases while in detention, in other cases in their homes along with their families. The identity of the perpetrators is not always known. Between 18 and 23 January, a former Major, Jean de Dieu Bizabarimana, his wife and their children were killed in Nyarutovu, Ruhengeri, and former Major Francois-Xavier Uwimana and his six children were killed in Nyamyumba, Gisenyi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent increase in violence is spreading fear among a population already tense and suspicious of reprisals on both sides in the aftermath of the return of more than one million refugees, many of whom are suspected of having participated in the 1994 genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fear in Rwanda is tangible. People are terrified to speak and many told us that they no longer dare travel to certain regions. We were informed of cases of unexplained killings and 'disappearances' occurring even in the capital Kigali,&quot; the delegates said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These fears are affecting the local population and foreign organizations alike. The killing of five United Nations human rights workers in Cyangugu, in the southwest, on 4 February has had a particularly devastating effect, preventing international and local organizations from carrying out independent investigations into human rights violations in certain parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International believes this could herald the start of a dangerous situation where the perpetrators can carry on killing defenceless civilians with no independent observers left to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government of Rwanda must take immediate measures to prevent a situation where such acts of extreme violence become a fact of a daily life,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government should exercise control over its own security forces and ensure that officials involved in human rights violations are suspended from their duties and brought to justice. All incidents of human rights violations should be the subject of an independent and impartial investigation and the results should be made public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is also urging armed opposition groups to immediately stop carrying out deliberate and arbitrary killings of unarmed civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda's government cannot be held accountable for the actions of armed opposition groups; however, it has a responsibility to ensure that there are no reprisal killings by its own forces, the organization said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Zaire's Transitional Parliament (HCR-PT), voted yesterday to remove Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo from office. About 470 delegates of a total 738 attempted to oust Kengo in a vote &quot;by consensus&quot; shortly after he flew to Kenya to attend a summit in Nairobi to discuss the Zairean crisis.  The vote also called for a ceasefire and talks with the rebels. It was not immediately clear whether the vote carried legal authority; many of Kengo's supporters stayed away. Kengo had been re-appointed Prime Minister of the Crisis Government by President Mobutu in December 1996. Kengo said in Nairobi today that he was still Prime Minister, according to Kenyan KTN television.  EU Special Envoy Aldo Ajello told KTN that the Parliament's decision was &quot; illegal&quot;. Zaire's deputy Prime Minister Lambert Mende Omalanga is quoted by AFP today as saying the vote was &quot;unconstitutional&quot;. Zaire has suffered from constitutional chaos since the early 1990s. Anzuluni Bembe, a senior Zairean parliamentarian, told Reuters that a three-quarter majority would be needed fo rthe vote to be valid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* CNN showed pictures of troops of the former Rwandan government captured in the battle for Kisangani. They claimed they were forced to fight by the Zairean Armed Forces. Hundreds of Zairean government troops were reported to have handed over their weapons to rebels at a military camp outside Kisangani.  The ex-FAZ troops are to be &quot;re-educated&quot; re-trained, rebel commander Joseph Kabila, son of rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila told Reuters. Serb mercenaries based at Kisangani are accused of executions and torture of civilians by local people. An IPS report from Belgrade yesterday reported that despite Serbian government denials of official involvement in mercenary operations in Zaire, CNN TV pictures had shown Yugoslav-made uniforms, sniper rifles and fighter planes being used in Kisangani. A mercenary recruiter in Bosnian Serb army said that Croats and Muslims had also been recruited; &quot; Imagine, we'll be on the same side now&quot;, he is reported is saying. In a CNN interview, Jospeh Kabila denied that the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) was receiving help from either Angola or Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* ADFL rebels claim to be over 100 kms west of the Zaire river, and have taken Kasongo and Kibombo, south of Kindu. In an AFP report, Kabila is reported to offer the Zairean military the opportunity to lay down their weapons and &quot;await the army of liberation.&quot; He threatened those who continue fighting with trials in special tribunals. Well-placed sources told IRIN of looting by retreating FAZ forces in Kabinda, 100 kms northeast of Mbuji-Mayi.  Isangi, 150 km west of Kisangani has also suffered looting, the sources say.  Lebanese businesspeople in Lubumbashi have started to evacuate their families, according to Reuters. Twenty-five Lebanese women and children were evacuated to South Africa last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The diaspora of Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire continues to spread.  Humanitarian sources say some up to 2,000 refugees have arrived in Lodja, over 250 km west of Kindu. They are thought to have come from a group earlier collected at Kalima. The refugees remaining at Tingi-Tingi, despite being in poor condition, are being moved to Amisi by ADFL authorities. A further 28 unaccompanied minors were flown by UN agencies from Tingi-Tingi to Goma yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A 35 metric ton WFP IL-76 cargo flight headed for Kisangani from Mwanza had to turn back today when it was ordered to land at Goma. A later flight succeeded in reaching Kisangani. A smaller plane carrying an interagency team flew from Goma to Kisangani to meet the cargo flight and make preliminary assessments. Rebel authorities in Kisangani broacast a demand to the local population to return looted relief food seized from aid agency warehouses within two days or &quot;face severe consequences&quot;. Two truckloads have so far been returned. WFP currently has about 150 MTs in stock in Kisangani, and an additional 100 MTs or more may have been looted during the takeover of Kisangani and retreat of FAZ troops last weekend. The re-opening of the airlift route bodes well for the supply of food to 35,000 displaced Zaireans in Kisangani, but means of reaching refugees at Ubundu, 30,000 of whom have now crossed to the west of the river, remain uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* US State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns said that reports of the involvement of neighbouring countries in the Zaire conflict was &quot;an extremely troubling development... that Zaire is threatened on all sides.&quot; Burns also mentioned &quot;men in arms coming across the Angolan-Zairean border.&quot; US military specialists and contractors are due to arrive in Brazzaville, Congo, on Wednesday to make preparations for a possible evacuation of US citizens, reports AP. Reports from Congo indicate that several dozen US citizens have already taken refuge in Brazzaville. Belgium has recommended that its citizens quit Zaire if their presence is not essential. The foreign ministry announced that there were 2,800 Belgians living in Zaire at the beginning of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* President Mobutu Sese Seko's son, Nzanga Mobutu, said that rumours concerning his father's health &quot;criminal and irresponsible&quot;, and said he would invite the press to Mobutu's villa near Nice, France to &quot;clarify the situation&quot; as soon as the ailing president is discharged, reports AFP. Close aide Honore Ngbanda Nzambo Ko Atume announced that Mobutu would return to Zaire at the end of the week. Le Monde reported Tuesday that Mobutu was receiving blood transfusions to compensate from &quot;bladder hamorrhaging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Nairobi summit today included the presidents of Kenya, Congo, and Zimbabwe as well as Vice President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Prime Minister Peter Mafany Musonge of Cameroon. International envoys Howard Wolpe (US) and Aldo Ajello (EU) as well as Joint OAU/UN Special Representative Mohamed Sahnoun will attend as observers. Senior US diplomat George Moose and Salim Ahmed Salim, OAU Secretary-General are also attending the summit.  Canadian special envoy Marius Bujold was also in Nairobi today. Ajello said that one of the tasks before the meeting was to develop an agenda for the OAU- sponsored meeting in Lome on March 26, reports Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel leader Kabila, not invited to the summit, has dismissed it as &quot; irrelevant&quot;, and has scorned Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi as &quot;another Mobutu&quot;, reports say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* US Assistant Secretary of State George Moose and French Foreign Minister Herve de Charrette made a joint plea for Kabila to &quot;accept the international community's invitation to a ceasefire and dialogue&quot;. French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said that continued operations by the rebels could have &quot;extremely grave consequences&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The population of Lugufu camp near Kigoma, Tanzania, housing Zairean refugees transferred from centres in Kigoma town, has swelled to 46,000.  About 500 new arrivals (down from 1,000 a day last month) are registered every day in Tanzania, a mixture of Zaireans and Burundians. Kigoma region in Tanzania holds the largest concentration of refugees in the Great Lakes region. The combined population of Zairean and Burundian refugees in Tanzania has quadrupled in the last four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A press release from the Ugandan President's office appeals to the UN Secretary-General to assist Uganda in securing the release of Ugandan abductees, alleged to be held in Sudan. The statement says that 24 school girls from St Mary's College, Aboke were kidnapped on 10 October 1996 and were being held in Aruu, southern Sudan. Another six girls were rescued by Ugandan forces, the statement says. President Museveni's letter to Annan said that the girls are among &quot;thousands who have been abducted into Sudan by agents of thhe Sudan Government.. Many of these, according to evidence, are sold into slavery and others are gang-pressed into banditry activities.&quot; Uganda reserves the right to take &quot;all legitimate measures to end such criminality&quot;, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another round of peace talks between Sudan and Uganda are scheduled for June in Iran. Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Mohammad Taha, announcing the talks in Khartoum, said, however, that Ugandan &quot;agression&quot; and &quot;direct support&quot; to southern rebels meant that the current crisis in relations would be hard to resolve, reports AFP. Sudanese SPLA rebels said on Wednesday that their forces had retaken Chali-el-Fil from government forces, near the Ethiopian on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNHCR Nairobi say that about 100 Rwandan detainees remain at Wilson airport, having flown in from Tingi-Tingi camp in Zaire just before it fell under the control of Zairean ADFL rebels. At the beginning of the week, unconfirmed reports say that some detainees are thought to have escaped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UN today launched an appeal for $324.5 million for the Great Lakes region. The appeals covers needs in the countries of the region during 1997 excluding Rwanda, which has requested to be treated separately. The appeal describes programmes by UN agencies to provide urgent humanitarian assistance to 1.4 milllion refugees, displaced and war-affected populations. It also includes projects to repair environmental and social damage caused by refugee camps in eastern Zaire and Tanzania. Voluntary repatriation of Rwandan refugees remains a priority objective, while repatriation of Burundians is not currently promoted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two previous appeals for the Great Lakes launched in 1996, covering calendar 1996 plus January 1997, raised a total of $582.2 million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - JOE Nkuna (54) is one of those poor and illiterate subsistence farmers that all game wardens fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lives in a small impoverished village right on the fence of the Blyde Canyon River Reserve and counts the days before his clan's land claim is finally processed so that he can put his cattle onto the 'virgin' bush just beyond the hated fence which has locked him out of his ancestral home for the past 20-years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only good thing about wild animals, he believes, is that you can eat them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, within the space of two short months, Joe's entire set of lifelong beliefs about the best use of land and wild animals has changed dramatically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he's not the only one. Communities all around the Blyde River Reserve and a similar reserve at Loskop Dam have suddenly released that untouched bush and the 'pests' that live in it are worth billions of rands to foreign investors and tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paradigm switch in beliefs isn't, however, the result of an educational or community outreach drive. It has, in fact, been the result of the exact opposite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe only realised that there was real money, and the chance at creating a sustainable local economy out of conservation tourism after &quot;the Parks Board tried to steal our land for a second time and sell its use to foreigners for fifty years&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is even longer than apartheid lasted and, at my age, I won't last to see the land free again. But, when we heard how much these people were prepared to pay for use of the land, we didn't need a school education to know that there is a lot more money there than in just farming,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now, we'll keep most of our land as bush, like the conservationists want it, and will only reclaim a small part for our cattle and houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return, communities like Joe's will receive 20 per cent shares in the joint venture companies Dolphin will form with MPB to run the reserves, as well as benefiting from massive infra-structure creation projects and the growth of a guaranteed 'feeder' economy to supply the reserves with essentials and other items such as curios and auxiliary attractions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, if there's one other thing that communities such as Joe's have discovered during the Dolphin debate, then it is that even small, isolated and rural communities have a voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already this voice can be heard asking why if Dolphin is prepared to offer 20 per cent, then surely there must be someone out there willing to offer 25 per cent? - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - IF nothing else, the Dolphin Deal debacle has taught State funded Parks Boards that they are answerable to mere mortals - even if those mortals are dirt poor and illiterate communities living along their boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The days when Parks Boards, which control the World's second biggest canyon at Blyde River and a clutch of popular reserves in Mpumalanga, simply decided what was 'best' for conservation and for affected communities are gone forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But so are the large State subsidies and other resources which ensured that South Africa can today boost of Africa's best run reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accepting that reserves will be eroded by land and resource pressures unless they can be made to pay for themselves and at the same time uplift surrounding communities and economies, conservationists agree that controlled commercialisation is the only realistic option.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not ideal, as demonstrated when Dolphin president, Ketan Somaia, conceded that he would never be able to buy the sweeping monopolistic rights to similar sites in the First World, such as the USA's Grand Canyon, as he was being offered here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All he would say was the &quot;Africa is different - its a completely different game down here&quot;. MPB officials agree. It's eat or be eaten, they insist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, the MPB's bungling of its commercialisation programme has also been used as an excuse by government leaders in Mpumalanga to re-exert direct political control over the previously autonomous parastatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the guise of &quot;rescuing&quot; the multi-billion rand deal, which gives the controversial Dolphin Group the right to commercially develop various state owned game reserves in the heart of South Africa's 'safari' region, the government slashed the financial and executive powers of both the MPB and the independent watchdog Environmental Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also limited MPB's mandate to only six provincial reserves and announced an immediate restructuring process of both the MPB's Board of Directors and its internal structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite continuing doubts about the business credibility of Dolphin's president, Ketan Somaia, who is involved in a R35-million tender dispute in Kenya, the government also recommitted the province's key tourist attractions to Dolphin's control for at least 25-years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a halving of the original contract which gave Dolphin a complete commercial monopoly of the six reserves, plus the historic town of Pilgrim's Rest and Africa's reputed last undeveloped &quot;Big Five&quot; bush game reserve at nearby Manyeleti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revised contract expressly excluded both Pilgrim's Rest and Manyeleti and also tones down the 'exclusive rights' enjoyed by Dolphin via a zoning of reserves into bands of exclusive Dolphin and public access operational areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normal South African tourists, hiking fundis and even back-packers, who were collectively referred to as the &quot;sub-economic&quot; market by Dolphin when the deal was first announced, will therefore continue to have free access to at least parts of the affected game reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost as important is the MPB's recognition of the principal that game reserves are a common resource used by surrounding hotels, lodges and other tourist establishments to attract visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If any one company gets complete development and transverse rights to these 'magnets', the entire subsidiary industry is effectively destroyed - just to subsidise the budget of one small government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">department currently employing less that 600 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other, and by now well publicised, amendments to the contract include the dumping of a 50-year secrecy clause, the removal of a &quot;get-out&quot; escape clause for Dolphin should they find the deal less profitable than expected, and greater equity ownership of joint venture companies by surrounding communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Dolphin pointedly withdrew its initial blanket offer to cover MPB's budget deficit for the full contract period, it did commit itself to underwriting the parastatal's budget for at least 10-years while simultaneously paying the MPB 25 percent of any profits it generated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial guarantees will enable the MPB to develop or expand other community reserves and to pro-actively tackle nature conservation in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPB insists that it had no choice but to seek private sector investment. It asked government for a R55-million personnel and salary budget for the 1997/ 98 financial year but was told it would only receive R11-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if it had received the R55-million it asked for, this would still have only covered its basic running expenses and would have made absolutely no provision for capital growth, expansion or upgrading of reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had to ask quite simply whether there was even a future for conservation in the region unless we found a joint venture partner. And despite our recent experiences, MPB still believes that unless we commercialise, our parks will go exactly the same way as those further north in Zimbabwe and elsewhere in Africa,&quot; explains MPB spokesman, Gary Sutter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no choice - it's commercialise or stagnate and eventually die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political intervention and close media scrutiny has also led to a rethink by the MPB of some of the scheme's more contentious development projects - such as a massive 'White Mischief' theme hotel in the parastatal's flagship Songimvelo Game Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although previously virtually unknown to tourists, Songimvelo experienced wide exposure when the Michael Douglas movie 'Ghost &amp; the Darkness' was shot on the reserve's magnificent grasslands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building on the Victorian Age theme of pioneer Kenya, MPB proposed that a 300 bed R250-million hotel with a number of smaller 'boutique' camps be built at the reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guests would have to leave their vehicles outside the park and would be transported to the hotel by period steam train, via the railway station which was built as the principal set for the movie. Even the hotel's safari vehicles would be built to resemble 1940 vintage cars and rangers would be called 'Askaris' and dressed in appropriate Kenyan costume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Askari idea was quickly dropped when journalists had to disbelievingly explain to MPB officials that the word has violently political connotations in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservationists and archaeologists have also objected to the importation of a Kenyan theme to South Africa, when Songimvelo already has extensive ruins of stone walled settlements, possibly related to the gold civilizations of Great Zimbabwe and Thulamela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more sarcastic critics quip that the Lost City or a recreation of history visionist Cyril Hromnik's (check spellling) Dravidian colonies would be more appropriate and just as marketable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other grandiose projects that have been shelved, for now, include a cable car in the Blyde River Canyon and an American South paddle steamer, possibly with a small casino on board, on Loskop Dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Definite developments or innovations which are going to be implemented include the introduction of hot air balloon safaris, white river rafting safaris on the Blyde River and R400-million worth of new hotels and lodges over the next three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These new developments will also be 'branded' or 'themed' to make them unique, but officials assure that the themes will be less contentious than the Songimvelo project. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - IS Dolphin really the environmental boogeyman that it's made out to be in the media?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost without exception, the multi-billion dollar company has been portrayed by the press both here and in Kenya as a ruthless profit obcessed monster, headed by a president who successfully defied the Kenyan Parliament for seven years after allegedly failing to deliver on a R35-million tender he won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Dolphin with its 20 000 employees, 29 odd subsidiaries and various other interests is more than just Ketan Somaia or the Mpumalanga parks deal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also Block Hotels - at 70-years Africa's oldest and one of its most respected hotel groups which dominates the tourism lodge industry in Kenya and is making fast inroads into Zimbabawe, Namibia and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporting this, is the 50-year old UTC Destination Management, voted Tour Operator of the Year 1995, which claims to bring more than 750 000 tourists to Africa every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin is also Delphis Bank, a newspaper group, a TV production company, a music studio, a cinema chain, commodities trading, vehicle manufacturing fanchises, a sugar refinery, a vehicle rental company and a long string of casinos, restaurants and heath clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin's president, Somaia, started life as simple Mombasa trader but quickly built himself into one of Kenya's most powerful figures through a series of controversial take-overs and buyouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Mpumalanga legislative team, which visited Dolphin operations in Kenya and Dubai were &quot;completely awed by their standards of proffessionalism, vast interests and reputation&quot;, with opposition politicians drooling over Dolphin suggestions that it would pick up the tab for the province's first international airport, an offer to pump millions into small business development and also pay to set up an international standard tourism college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, Africa isn't for sissies. In anycase, if you look at the amounts involved in the alleged fraud in Kenya, then the alleged misappropriation is a drop in the sea compared to the Kenyan economy - or even the Dolphin economy. All businessmen have at least some deals that go sour and some that work out,&quot; explained Freedom Front whip, Hein Mentz. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - It seems unlikely that the revised and &quot;sanitised&quot; contract between Mpumalanga's Parks Board (MPB) and the Dubai-based Dolphin Group which was announced yesterday will save the career of MPB's outspoken head, Alan Gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new contract, which was drafted during often strained all-night negotiations in Johannesburg earlier this week, slashes Dolphin's hopes for a 50-year monopoly of state owned game reserves in Mpumalanga to a watered down 25-year right to operate in a limited number of reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin will, even then, only enjoy exclusive operation rights in certain zoned areas of affected reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even this revised contract seems destined to be brought into question after the national Portfolio Committee on the Environment sent a letter to Minister Pallo Jordaan on Monday demanding a full investigation into the desirability of the deal, based on the premise that the game reserves involved are a national asset which should not be commercialised simply to pay for the running of a single government department employing less than 600 people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost immediately after the revised deal was clinched on Wednesday provincial politicians, who had up until now been unusually silent about widespread public criticism on the deal, began directing blame for their embarrassment at Gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Gray's own environmental affairs MEC, David Mkhwanazi, told the Mail &amp; Guardian on Tuesday night before releasing internal and confidential government memorandums from a 'special file' that &quot;I never once supported the original contract ... it was steamrollered through&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I set out all my reservations in a memo to Gray in October last year before he signed the original contract - but he never listened. If he had, none of this would have happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memorandum, dated ten days before the contract was signed on November 1 last year, stresses Mkhwanazi's unease about the commercial monopoly that would be created if one company was granted sole rights to all the reserves and also question's Gray's commitment of government funds to the deal without cabinet approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though I clearly instructed him to put the matter before the cabinet for ratification before signing anything, this was not done. Instead we were given a colourful slide presentation by the MPB,&quot; added Mkhwanazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the guise of rescuing the multi-billion deal, Mkhwanazi also announced that he had &quot;re-exerted&quot; his political control over the supposedly autonomous parastatal, was busy changing legislation so he could scrap the MPB's internal tender committee, was severely curtailing the powers of Gray and was placing severe financial limitations on the Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also stressed that the government was taking over control of salaries at the MPB after complaints that people in equivalent posts were earning widely different salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&amp;G incorrectly referred to Gray as a consultant last week but has since established that he serves as the MPB's chief executive officer on a 5-year fixed term contract with a cash salary of between R34 000 and R40 000 per month, plus various benefits and perks worth an additional but unspecified sum. Gray's superior in the Department of Environmental Affairs, to whom he supposedly answers, earns only R13 800 per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a lengthy lawyer's letter this week responding to the M&amp;G's revelation that many of his private companies enjoyed the patronage of the MPB, Gray also denies that he personally brokered the deal with Dolphin, insisting that Dolphin was introduced to him by Mpumalanga Finance Corporation head, Sam Cronje.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Cronje was until late last year a partner in Air Excellence - the company which shares office space with Gray's Lowveld Helicopter Services (LHS) and which LHS staff insist has taken over operations for LHS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronje failed to respond to M&amp;G's repeated attempts to contact him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray also continued to refuse to say how much money the MPB had spent with LHS to date, or to explain why the parastatal had ordered a fixed-wing aircraft from the helicopter company to fly politicians down to Cape Town three weeks ago, to brief parliament on the Dolphin Deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because LHS doesn't have any fixed wing-planes, Gray's company was forced to sub-lease a King Air from a rival Nelspruit company. It is unclear whether LHS added its own 'commission' on to the charter price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he denies still being involved with Air Excellence, the listed director for the new company is Gray's good friend, Sean McMurray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMurray serves on the MPB's board of directors and also leases the MPB its regional offices in Witbank. Gray denies that he has any business links with McMurray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMurray accompanied Gray and his MPB team on their investment seeking trip to the east, where he met with Dolphin at similar times as MPB in both Dubai and London. During the meetings, he sold half of his interests in his Royal Hotel in Pilgrim's Rest and Promenade Hotel in Nelspruit to Dolphin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPB also recently appointed McMurray as chairman of the Somalanga Development Company, which will develop MPB's flagship Songimvelo Game Reserve in a joint venture with Dolphin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Johnnic stake was negotiated through the National Empowerment Consortium, a grouping of black trade unions and business, and puts the Siphumelele group up alongside better-known partners in the consortium, such as Cyril Ramaphosa's New Africa Investments and Wiseman Nkuhlu's Worldwide Africa, giving Montsi a seat on Johnnic's new board of directors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the other big stakeholders in Johnnic, Siphumelele is rooted in the Western Cape - a factor which encouraged the banks to fund the transaction, Montsi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shareholders in Siphumelele range from estate agents in Athlone and community leaders in Kensington to doctors and lawyers in Paarl and fruit dealers in Pniel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Johnnic deal will give them an indirect stake in a range of businesses from SA Breweries and the Premier group, with its retail, food and pharmaceutical interests, to M-Net and Times Media, owners of publications including Business Day and the Sunday Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Orlando, Johannesburg, Montsi went to school in Lesotho, &quot; to escape the Bantu education system, which stunted people&quot; and worked for years as managing director of the Lesotho Development Corporation. He came to the Western Cape in 1987 to work as general manager in SA Breweries' beer division and left six years ago to start his own consulting business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My friends said, Why leave? You have a nice house, a comfortable life and plenty of free beer. I said, I am a man who likes to ride wild horses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like to create new things and make things happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operating out of offices in a Newlands house, Montsi and Associates' main activity is linking black entrepreneurs with mainstream business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A contract with the Anglovaal group enabled Montsi to turn R6-million of Anglovaal business towards black entrepreneurs last year and R26-million in the same direction this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has a similar contract with the National Industrial Chamber, an arm of the National African Federated Chambers of Commerce (Nafcoc) funded by USAid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fishing - Montsi and Associates has a small hake quota and own a fishing vessel - and property development are other arms of the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Projects completed include the Nyanga Station shopping centre and the conversion of the old Diep River bus depot into a business village which opened last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newest project is the R9-million restoration of the historical Bree Street- Shortmarket Street block in the city centre. The project includes plans for a hotel, restaurants and crafts shops, including a blacksmith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Montsi is married to Fazila and they have four children who do not see enough of their father, he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - As the first step in a move into the services industry, Western Cape investment group Siphumelele has taken a R120-million stake in Fedics in partnership with two other black empowerment groupings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fedics shareholders ICS and Servgro have each sold a 16,67 percent interest in the group to the consortium, which consists of Siphumelele, KwaZulu-Natal- based Investments Progress Holdings and Gauteng-based Nozala Investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siphumelele director Tiisetso Tsukudu will sit on the board of Fedics, which will be chaired by Nozala director Dawn Mokhobo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siphumelele chief executive Lionel Jacobs told the Cape Argus the Fedics investment was in line with plans by the group to move into the beverages, hotels and leisure industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headed by Sam Montsi, Siphumelele has 90 shareholders including the Food and Allied Workers' Union. Its interests include a stake in Johnnic, a 51 percent holding in Expercable in a joint venture with Phillips Business Electronics, a 6 percent stake in Channel 6 Television, a 20 percent holding in Cape Talk Radio and a 75 percent interest in a joint venture with Nedbank Investment Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is our first completed move into the beverages, hotels and leisure sector,&quot; Mr Jacobs said. He confirmed that other investments in the sector were in the pipeline but he would not give details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a passive investment,&quot; Mr Jacobs said. &quot;We have joint control and we intend to be involved in active management at all levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have real expertise which we can add to this investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fedics, which has a turnover of R710 million a year, has interests ranging from contract catering (through Fedics Food Services) to travel and tourism.  The group owns two inflight catering companies - Air Chefs, a joint venture with Transnet, and Gate Gourmet, a joint venture with Swiss Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fedics also has a 40 percent interest in Protea Hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Managing director David Wigley said the transaction valued the company at R360 million which meant that the consortium was &quot;getting a good price&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would get a rather better price on the public market,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal would put Fedics in a strong position to compete for public sector contracts, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are lots of opportunities in that market and we think this will enrich our chances in a market where we are reasonably successful already.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Despite vehement protests from some residents, the Kensington night shelter for vagrants is going ahead and construction has just started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is according to Lawrence Wakens, chairman of the Haven Night Shelter in Kensington, who said the protesters were &quot;in the minority&quot; and would not deter the night shelter committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent church service at the shelter site was marred when picketing protesters opposed to its location got involved in a slanging match with members of the Night Haven organisation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shelter will be built on the corner of 13th Avenue and Dapperweg, the same site as the Kensington Sports Club, and will house 38 vagrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although generally in favour of the idea of a night shelter, residents say they do not want it on the doorstep of their sportsclub, fearing the club will be affected by construction of the shelter and that the vagrants will cause an increase in crime and gangsterism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was rejected by Mr Wakens, who said night shelters in other areas had contributed to a decrease in gangsterism because vagrants were off the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can looking after a vagrant aggravate gangsterism? That is very far- fetched. We are providing a service by taking the vagrants off the street and trying to rehabilitate them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Wakens said the Cape Town municipality's community liaison unit found the majority of Kensington residents supported the shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Haven had bought the ground and acquired a lease for 25 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planning process went on for more than three years without objections until the establishment of the sportsclub last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the project was definitely going ahead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Some of the Western Cape's top policemen are poised to take early retirement as their careers founder in the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some cite affirmative action for blocking their career paths in the new police service and some also hammer the new constitution for imposing restrictions on police investigations of serious crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top officers say there is no future for them in the police and that it was a case of leaving while the going is good. They said it would be suicidal to &quot; pour our hearts out&quot; because &quot;anything could happen&quot; and severance packages could be refused.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key officers believed to have applied for severance packages include West Metropole area commissioner Quinton Visser, provincial head of detective services Willem Smit, head of the Violent Crimes Unit Leonard Knipe, Priority Crimes Unit boss Boet Claasen, head of logistics Barney Engelbrecht and Mitchell's Plain's station commissioner Johan Kleyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several of those contemplating early retirement also were recently implicated at the Truth Commission over the 1986 shooting of seven African National Congress activists in Guguletu. These include directors Knipe and Kleyn and public relations chief John Sterrenberg, Fanie Bouwer, provincial head of proactive policing and Senior Superintendent Sterrenberg are also expected to apply for early retirement packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Visser confirmed he had applied for a package. &quot;I've reached the age to retire. With 35 years' service behind me I have done my bit,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Knipe, who would not confirm or deny he was leaving, said he was concerned about the mass walkout of experienced top police and the drain of expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether I'm leaving or not is between myself and the commissioner. But I will continue to be a police officer until my last hour in the service,&quot; Director Knipe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Knipe has indicated privately that the fettering of detectives investigating serious crimes is a contributing factor in resignations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - What started out as a discussion among a few friends concerned about gangsterism and drugs on the Cape Flats, developed into People Against Gangsterism And Drugs (Pagad).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation quickly captured the attention of the world when its supporters were allegedly involved in the fiery public lynching of gang leader and drug merchant Rashaad Staggie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The birth of Pagad dates back to July 1995 when 10 friends, all of whom are still part of the organisation, began getting other people involved and highlighted drugs and gangsterism as a major problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of meetings were held to devise ways of addressing the issue and to talk about the failure of existing organisations to eradicate the scourge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the attendance at these meetings increased, the need to establish an effective and dynamic campaign against gangsterism and drugs became apparent.  The silent suffering of the people no longer sufficed and they sought ways to empower themselves against these social evils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad was seen as the means of empowering the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was against this background that Pagad decided to invite religious leaders of all denominations and people from different backgrounds to take part and to broaden its base in articulating its objective of eradicating drugs and gangs from society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roman Catholic priest Christopher Clohessy was one of the many outspoken non-Muslim clerics to come out in support of Pagad's ideals of Pagad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people need to be able to defend themselves. I'm one who wants a gun- free society. If the gangsters attack the people, they must be able to carry legal firearms and defend themselves,&quot; Father Clohessy advocated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, the organisation held meetings with government officials and departments at which they also raised the issue of corruption in government structures. Their concerns about drugs and gangsterism were also raised with the police, justice and correctional services departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad national secretary Sharief Khan claims: &quot;In spite of all these efforts by Pagad, no meaningful change was brought about by the police and justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a nutshell, all avenues that could be followed concerning the problem were exhausted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 11 1996 a march on Parliament was organised, calling for visual deterrents to gangsterism and drugs and more competent and effective legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation also handed Justice Minister Dullah Omar a memorandum listing their demands that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Those convicted of drug dealing should be hanged or given life sentences;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Those suspected of drug dealing should be monitored constantly and their properties searched without warrants;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Current lists of business people who were convicted on drug-dealing charges should be made known to the community;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All assets of guilty drug dealers should be frozen and their property confiscated and used for rehabilitation purposes;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The public should be informed about drug dealers linked to international syndicates and the type of drug routes and modus operandi of drug dealers; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Witness protection programmes should be established for people prepared to speak out against the criminals and all confiscated drugs should be publicly destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the organisation took to the streets and marched on the houses of known Cape Flats drug dealers and gangsters. Some of their first marches were violent with some supporters damaging houses and torching vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, on a cold August night, a march on the London Road, Salt River, house of the Staggie twins led to the brutal public slaying of Rashaad Staggie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This gruesome act was met with outrage by many people, including Pagad supporters, and evoked storms of protests and condemnation from a range of organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also led to the media being much more critical in their coverage of Pagad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the incident also spurred other groups in other urban centres to organise themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this period, the organisation's popular leaders, Ali &quot;Phantom&quot; Parker and Farouk Jaffer, were expelled from the movement because they were accused of bringing it into disrepute by allegedly inflammatory statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both were invited on several occasions to attend a Pagad general meeting to face the people and answer their questions, according to the current leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both refused to show up and, were expelled without any opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of further Pagad marches and protests also were marred by violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One at the Waterfront resulted in the death of Achmat Najjaar while most of the regional leaders were arrested during a confrontation with the police at the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Khan said their goal of eradicating gangsterism and drugs was a tremendous task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is remarkable that after 66 marches in the Western Cape, only three ended in confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Pagad succeeds, the entire country and all its citizens will benefit and reap the fruits of the tears, sweat and blood of those who selflessly fought in the struggle against gangsterism and drugs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After numerous marches, it became apparent that the strategy was working as drug dealers started cracking under the pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many stopped trading while others desperately tried to relocate their operations and began pushing up the prices of the drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the organisation came in for a lot of stick from the government because of Pagad's insistence on carrying firearms and covering their faces during their marches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Khan said: &quot;At a later stage, the wearing of facial covering and the carrying of firearms in a legal march became illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seemed as if the police wanted to stop Pagad from growing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of these obstacles, Pagad, which was at one stage merely a local organisation progressed to become a nationally structured body and will hold its next national conference in Cape Town at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Khan said there was no organised or systematic approach to ridding society of gangs and drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No single agency or level of government had taken responsibility for the eradication of the scourge in its broadest sense and there was currently no special plan to manage and co-ordinate crime prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategic initiatives were developed without adequate analysis of the root causes of the high crime rate and have focused on only a few aspects of the problem and existing crime prevention efforts have relied on reactive strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Pagad did not want to reduce the crime rate, it wanted to totally eradicate gangs and drugs from society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We argue that everyone is affected by the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let us not wait until we become victims, we already have seen how our children have been raped by gangsters...we have seen how our fathers and mothers have been brutalised and we have seen how our tourists have been robbed, raped and terrorised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pagad says we are sick and tired of this scourge and beg of you, as caring human beings, to stand up for yourselves and your children and join the fight against gangsterism and drugs,&quot; said Mr Khan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the message Sol Kreiner, former mayor and a leading figure in athletics circles, has brought back from the World Indoor Athletics Championships in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kreiner felt the Cape Town bid team should have made more of the opportunity to promote its Games bid at the Paris event.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was remiss not to have had someone there representing the bid,&quot; he said. However, he had done his bit. He had had breakfast with top African athlete Haile Gebrselassie, and gave him a bid T-shirt which he wore often for the remainder of his stay in the French capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kreiner said: &quot;There were a number of International Olympic Committee people in Paris and I sensed from them and other observers that although there are favourites Cape Town has a very good chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What has come across very strongly is that nobody has won or lost the right to host the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot can happen in the next six months and there are a number of events which could influence the final decision. A key example is the World Athletics Championships in August in Athens. The feeling in Paris was that if this was not very well organised it could seriously harm the Athens bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, South Africa is still in with a very good chance but clearly a lot of hard work must be done. There are 56 people Cape Town must convince if it is to win. This brought home to me how important it will be now to mobilise Africa's prominent athletes. One cannot overestimate the importance of establishing a presence at international sporting events of this kind and actively getting African athletes to back the bid.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Almost 92-cents of every one rand in Mpumalanga's budget for the 1997/ 98 fiscal year will be spent on civil service salaries and other recurrent expenditure because of the provincial government's bloated staff component, Finance MEC Jacques Modipane said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a cut of at least 6000 employees during the past year, this is an 11-percent increase in recurrent expenditure in last year's budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capital expenditure, in comparison, has been reduced by 36-percent in order to allow the provincial government to meet the national GEAR growth targets by the year 2000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further reduction in capital expenditure will also, Modipane said, be made during the next fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that Mpumalanga's 1997/ 98 budget of slightly over R5-billion was an effective reduction of 8,5-percent on last year's total allocation to the province, Modipane added that the only way Mpumalanga would meet its targets was to slash the public service staff by a further 15-percent before the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time for trade-offs, be they political, social or technological has dawned upon us. We will need to have the guts to offset the popular remuneration of civil servants against the provision of other goods and services,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance head of department, Leon Botha, described the budget as survival planning and said that &quot;if we can survive this, then we'll be able to survive anything&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In line with national policies, the education and health departments took the lion's share of the budget, while public works and housing followed fairly closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a budget which will change the lives of people this year, but it is a good start on our new multi-year budgeting approach, in which we will attempt to target very specific areas for accelerated development in a staggered three year budget plan,&quot; explained Modipane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that Mpumalanga was playing a leading role in the expansion of own revenues, Finance head of department, Leon Botha pointed out that Mpumalanga had managed to collect R180-million from its own limited resources because of improved collection and enforcement systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modipane dismissed criticism in the Steyn Report on the Remuneration of Traditional Leaders that Mpumalanga had grossly overpaid the members of its House of Traditional Leaders by saying that the province had a &quot;duty to maintain the status quo and to keep the country intact. If we had decreased the chief's salaries, they would have embarked on guerrilla warfare&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other interesting points in the budget included the decision not to make any provision for the Mpumalanga Parks Boards estimated budget deficit.  Opposition MPLs pointed out that there is therefore no &quot;safety net&quot; for the parastatal if its controversial deal with the Dolphin Group fails to materialise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga did also not budget for any remuneration packages for retiring teachers because, Botha explained, central government had merely asked the provinces to gauge how many civil servants would possibly seek retrenchment packages and had not asked them to budget for the packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we need the money, central government will transfer it to us,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province has also again neglected to budget for any capital investment to get Mpumalanga's first international airport off the ground, which Nelspruit based businessmen claim is costing the province at least R1-million per day in lost trade opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha did, however, say that they had made R200 000 provision for an additional feasibility study by foreign consultants later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition MPL's and parliamentary observers described the budget as a conservative yet focused and well researched attempt to bring government spending in line with its other macro growth strategies. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Four people, including one leading candidate in one of the five political parties involved in last Saturday's local council polls, were sentenced to various jail terms Wednesday by a magistrate's court in Akure, western Nigeria, for electoral offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate for a council chair, Pojo Joshua of the Congress for National Consensus party, in the western state of Ondo, is to spend one year in prison without an option of fine for unlawful possession of a voter's card belonging to his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from across the country said dozens of suspects were arrested for alleged offenses during the elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a government official has warned of severe punishment against anyone found to have engaged in sharp practices in the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to descend on them (the offenders) and all those arrested will be decisively punished,&quot; Navy Capt. Joseph Adeusi, military administrator of the south-eastern state of Akwa Ibom, told journalists Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking after a meeting between Nigerian head of state Gen. Sani Abacha and 36 state military administrators to review the conduct of the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adeusi said while some of the hitches were &quot;human and understandable, we have resolved that some lapses will not be taken lightly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among practices considered grave, he said, were the removal of voters cards and ballot boxes during voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 56 million eligible voters took part in the polls to choose some 8,000 councilors and chairpersons from the 776 council areas in the country of some 100 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian newspapers also reported four deaths in the south-eastern state of Rivers and the Mid-western state of Delta in poll-related incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise, overall reports indicated that the council elections, the first multi-party polls under the military government's 36-month transition to democracy programme, went well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 38-member election monitors from the United States said apart from a few logistic problems, the council elections were free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nigeria Congress Party has continued to maintain a commanding lead against four of its rivals in results so far released by the election commission nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elected council chairmen are to be inaugurated Monday by the state administrators. They will in turn induct the councilors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The electoral commission is to fix dates for run-offs or by-elections in councils were balloting were either stalemated, cancelled or did not take place Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter says a successful Ethiopian experiment in new farm technologies may help solve the problem of food shortages in Africa and other parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an article published in a U.S. newspaper on Thursday, Carter said new farm techniques introduced to Ethiopian farmers in 1986 had led to 200 percent to 400 percent yields over traditional methods, creating a record grain harvest in 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Simple&quot; techniques, such as seedbed preparation and improved seed varieties, were introduced by the Atlanta-based Carter Center, a non-profit organisation; Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug and Japan-based Sasakawa Africa Association, under a partnership called Sasakawa-Global 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The famine in Ethiopia and the surrounding nations in the mid-1980s prompted the partnership to work towards promoting efficient farming techniques in those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Knowledge about improved practices was available but not flowing from African research centers through government extension services to small-scale farmers,&quot; Carter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We set out to break this logjam, and now more than half-a-million small- farm families have greatly increased their yields,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former president explained that unlike many other internationally- funded programmes, the partnership worked closely with each country's government, allowing a network to expand from the highest political officials to the individual farmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What has happened in Ethiopia demonstrates that a plentiful food supply is possible for all nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is needed is the political and social will of the developed world to address the root causes of food shortages, not just donate money,&quot; Carter said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm, in which the Nigerian federal government has 40 percent equity participation, said in a statement it expected 22.5 billion dollars in revenue over 22 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - The Organisation of African Unity's (OAU) ongoing efforts to resolve the five-month old crisis In Zaire through negotiations is likely to come unstuck as the anti-government forces have defiantly decided to settle the issue on the battle field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series of meetings so far held also appear to be fraught with flaws that the rebel movement, led by 56-year-old Laurent-Desire Kabila, is exploiting to its advantage and splitting the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as Wednesday's mini-summit in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, was going on, Kabila declared that the war would continue, describing the talks as &quot; irrelevant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit, hosted by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, was attended by Congolese President Pascal Lisouba, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, Cameroonian Prime Minister Peter Musonge and Zairian Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo. Also participating at the summit dubbed &quot;Nairobi lll&quot; to discuss solutions to a crisis, were OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim and OUA/UN joint Special Representative to the Great Lakes region Mohamed Sahnoun.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous summits in Nairobi (November 1996), South Africa (December 1996), Nairobi (January 1997) have all produced communiques demanding a cease-fire which analysts now say are out of touch with the realities on the ground in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels have now captured over a fifth of the country's territory and have vowed to proceed to Kinshasa, the Zairian capital, to end President Mobutu Sese Seko's 31-year-old rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts familiar with the conflict say African leaders' decision to isolate the rebel movement from directly participating in the talks is likely to harden attitudes towards any reconciliation and cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is so because the rebels have reportedly received overwhelming political support from residents of the four towns they have so far captured, including the garrison town of Kisangani, the third largest city, which they captured last Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African leaders have also not involved other leaders from Angola, Rwanda and Uganda, whose governments are reportedly providing logistical support for the rebels, while the former Angolan rebel movement UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi, is said to be on the side of Mobutu's retreating government forces, thus further complicating the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a mistake not to involve all these parties,&quot; said an official familiar with the African-sponsored initiatives. &quot;The rebels have been given the impression that their side of the story is irrelevant. Kabila has already said the decisions of the meeting are not binding because he feels isolated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that South African President Nelson Mandela and Sahnoun had already set a precedent by meeting both sides, yet African leaders were excluding Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was clear during the final communique of the Nairobi summit, which referred to Kabila's rebel movement, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo/Zaire, as &quot;the other party to the conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila is also said to be opposed to Moi hosting the talks because of his perceived friendship with Mobutu, especially after the participation of Kengo wa Dondo at the Nairobi summit as the official Zairian government representative. Moi also visited Mobutu in Gbadolite in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels now view the African leaders' initiative as collectively biased against them and may not co-operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They see Moi as not a neutral mediator because he has already publicly condemned Kabila and was against South Africa's hosting of both parties,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Moi appeared to brush aside these concerns when he officially opened the summit, saying he was more concerned with pushing for a cease-fire which the rebels have rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that with Zaire's participation and presence, the search for peace will indeed gain considerable ground. All the parties to the conflict should restrain themselves and guarantee a negotiated settlement. We must not relent until we are assured that this is attainable,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nairobi communique expressed concern over the continued loss of lives, suffering of refugees and displaced persons as well as destruction of property and infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, it did not say what steps were being taken to bring the warring factions together despite calls for an unconditional acceptance of the five- point UN peace plan, which calls for a cease-fire, withdrawal of foreign forces and mercenaries, negotiations, protection of refugees and elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe insisted that the UN plan would be pushed for implementation despite Kabila's belligerence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is the view of those fighting because they are fighting for a cause, especially if their fighting is making progress,&quot; he said. &quot;But one important way of fighting which should never ever be rejected is negotiations. There comes a time when we say we have fought enough and must negotiate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that it was important for Kabila and others to listen to those who want to see peace and the process of democracy taking place in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Kabila and his rebel colleagues will respond and participate according to the requirements of the UN plan is the big question which even the African leaders cannot answer with certainty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga Parks Board's (MPB) board of directors has come to the defence of their embattled CEO, Alan Gray, after the province's environmental affairs MEC criticised his handling of the Dolphin parks deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEC Mkhwanazi said earlier this week that he had expressed his reservations about the deal's possible consequences to Gray in an urgent memo, before Gray signed the deal in secret last year November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never once supported the original contract ... it was steamrollered through. I set out all my reservations in a memo to Gray in October last year before he signed the original contract - but he never listened. If he had, none of this would have happened,&quot; explained MEC Mkhwanazi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memorandum, dated ten days before the contract was signed on November 1, stresses Mkhwanazi's unease about the commercial monopoly that would be created if one company was granted sole rights to all the reserves and also question's Gray's commitment of government funds to the deal without cabinet approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though I clearly instructed him to put the matter before the cabinet for ratification before signing anything, this was not done. Instead we were given a colourful slide presentation by the MPB,&quot; added Mkhwanazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPB's board of directors, however, passed a strongly worded resolution pldging their full support to Gray on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Board chairman, Dr Patrick Maduna, said that despite &quot;unsubstantiated accusations&quot; against Gray in the press, including allegations that an aviation company owned by Gray had been patronised by the MPB, the Board had found no grounds to suspect his integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that no 'evidence' could be found of any perceived or possible wrongdoing, the Board said in a statement that they were satisfied that Gray had conducted himself in a &quot;highly professional&quot; manner and would continue to have their full support and confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maduna later conceded to Sapa, however, that the Board had not examined the charges or attempted to verify whether they were correct or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The memo from the MEC to Gray did not go before the Board but there is truth in the statement that the Dolphin deal counld have been handled better - no-one can refute that. The Board expressed its support for Gray based on the information before it,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the guise of rescuing the multi-billion deal, Mkhwanazi also announced that he had &quot;re-exerted&quot; his political control over the supposedly autonomous parastatal, was busy changing legislation so he could scrap the MPB's internal tender committee, was severely curtailing the powers of Gray and was placing severe financial limitations on the Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also stressed that the government was taking over control of salaries at the MPB after complaints that people in equivalent posts were earning widely different salaries. Gray serves as the MPB's chief executive officer on a 5- year fixed term contract with a cash salary of between R34 000 and R40 000 per month, plus various benefits and perks worth an additional but unspecified sum. Gray's superior in the Department of Environmental Affairs, to whom he supposedly answers, earns only R13 800 per month. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - An attack on three displaced persons camps in Buganda commune of Cibitoke province of Burundi has left 135 dead and 144 wounded, Radio Burundi announced today. The dispatch says the attack, in which 300 shelters were burnt, was mounted by &quot;genocidal groups&quot; and that the camps were among those described by these groups as &quot;concentration camps&quot;. This implies that they were regroupment camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regroupment camps holding about 200,000, mainly Hutu, civilians are part of the government's strategy to counter insurgency by rebel groups, in particular the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD) and its armed wing, the Forces for the Defence of Democracy (FDD). Former UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes, Martin Griffiths said on March 7 that the international community should be &quot;fundamentally opposed&quot; to the regroupment policy, which the Burundian government claims is voluntary, but observers say is at least partially involuntary. However, given reports of malnutrition and health problems in the camps, UN agencies were willing to offer limited help to alleviate suffering under certain conditions. &quot;The dilemma for aid agencies is how to meet humanitarian needs without having the effect of encouraging the military policy&quot;, Griffiths said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a presentation yesterday by the Burundian Prime Minister, international aid agencies were warned that the Burundian government would henceforth be exercising a greater role in &quot;coordination&quot;, and would set priorities and areas in which NGOs should work. UN agencies, donors and NGOs have expressed deep reservations at being asked to supply services to the inhabitants of the regroupment camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* African leaders yesterday called for an immediate ceasefire in Zaire and negotiations to end the country's civil war, but made no new proposals for resolving the turmoil. The six-nation mini-summit in Nairobi called for the urgent implementation of the UN five point peace plan, drawn up by Mohamed Sahnoun, Joint UN/OAU Special Representative for the Great Lakes region, and urged all parties to facilitate access for humanitarian assistance. In a final communique, the leaders expressed grave concern at the rapidly deteriorating situation in Zaire and &quot;loss of lives, suffering of refugees, displaced persons and other victims of the conflict, as well as destruction of property and infrastructure&quot;. The Summit requested the establishment of a mechanism for monitoring the implementation of the peace plan and stressed the importance of Africa's involvement in the process. Leaders asked the 17- nation extraordinary summit of the conflict resolution Central Organ of the OAU, to be held in Lome, Togo on 26 March, to address this issue. UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, currently on an African tour, including South Africa and Angola, will attend the Lome summit. He said today that the Security Council would have to consider establshing a &quot;monitoring mechanism and that can only be done by troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at yesterday's summit, its chairman Kenyan President, Daniel arap Moi, warned that continued conflict in Zaire and the Great Lakes region would have repercussions &quot;far and wide&quot;. The president said that a negotiated settlement was necessary to arrive at a lasting solution. The summit, which lasted about four hours, was attended by Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, Pascal Lissouba of Congo, Vice-President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, Prime Minister Peter Mafany Musonge of Cameroon and Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, who was voted out of office in his absence by about 470 members of Zaire's 738-seat transitional parliament. Also attending the summit was the Secretary-General of the OAU, Salim Ahmed Salim and Sahnoun. Kengo's spokesman, Famboy Dema, called the vote a &quot;flagrant violation&quot; of the constitution of Zaire. The US government has also questioned the legality of the parliamentary vote and said that the US would continue to recognise Kengo as the legal authority of the government of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgium indirectly criticised the sacking and called on political parties in Zaire to end their &quot;useless quarrels and mobilise behind a common goal&quot;.  Military leaders are widely believed to be behind the move to sack Kengo.  However, Zairean Chief of Staff General Mahele Bokoungu said on CNN that the army remained non-political. Sources say that some generals want a replacement who would negotiate with Laurent-Desire Kabila, leader of the rebel group, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire. Kengo, who returned to Kinshasa today, has repeatedly refused to negotiate with the ADFL. The ADFL said that the sacking of Kengo did not change anything and that their objective was still to reach Zaire's capital, Kinshasa, by June. Spokesman Raphael Ghenda told AFP that the rebels wanted &quot; a major clean-up of the country's political rulers&quot;. Zaire's army also pledged yesterday to continue the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* General Mahele yesterday addressed officers and men of the FAZ in Kinshasa. He blamed the &quot;bad performance&quot; of the army in the east on the Zairean &quot;political class&quot;. He urged the solderis to respect military discipline, and said they had lost the battle, not the war. According to state-run Voice of Zaire radio, he called on the soldiers to respect military laws and regulations, protect people and property and defend the country's territorial integrity and republican institutions &quot;at all costs&quot;. He urged the army not to give in to &quot;mind poisoning&quot; which can make the army commit &quot; reprehensible acts&quot;. The army would from henceforth control acquisition and management of weapons and logistics directly, he said, while urging a lifting of the European arms embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko left hospital yesterday and will return to Zaire &quot;by the weekend&quot; said aides. Mobutu had been in hospital since Sunday after returning to France on 21 February for his third stay since surgery for prostate cancer in Switzerland in August last year. In a sign that preparations for his return to Zaire were underway, Mobutu's private plane was reported to be standing by at Nice airport. Mobutu was also scheduled to meet with journalists at his Riveria villa today but the session was cancelled at the last minute. In a telephone interview with CNN, Mobutu's son, Nzenga, said that his father would return to consult his parliament about whether he should enter into negotiations with Kabila. Asked whether Mobutu favoured negotiations, Nzenga said that it was &quot;too premature to discuss&quot; but that following yesterday's Nairobi summit he hoped that a solution could be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Swiss member of parliament and Berne based activist group urged the government and banks yesterday to freeze Mobutu's Swiss bank account, estimated in 1982 to be worth about US$ 4 billion. A spokeswoman for the Swiss Banker's Association said &quot;we are not aware of any reason to believe&quot; Mobutu had money in Swiss banks, reports Reuters. The plea was in response to Kabila's recent call for the return of Mobutu's fortunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* As fears grew that soldiers may loot Kinshasa, growing numbers of Zaireans, including another of Mobutu's sons, Kongolo Mobutu and two of his cousins, have left the city for neighbouring Congo. Kongolo, nicknamed &quot; Saddam Hussein&quot;, is reported to have fled last Thursday by river boat.  Sources said that he was booed on his arrival by Zaireans and Congolese.  Yesterday, Nzenga Mobutu denied that any close family members had fled Zaire.  Sources in Kinshasa say that the city remains very tense. Western diplomats and a source close to the presidency told AP that there a dangerous divisions among top generals between those loyal to Mobutu and those who would want to seize power in his absense. Many foreigners are also fleeing the city and some shops boarded at the weekend remain closed. The Congolese Red Cross has announced plans to set up a processing centre for refugees from Zaire at Moukondo in Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* France today recommended that its citizens to leave Zaire &quot;provisionally&quot; if their presence is not essential. France sent 100 troops, three planes and two helicopters to Libreville, Gabon and Brazzaville, Congo last night to assist in any evacuation if necessary. French Foreign Minister Herve de Charrette said in an interview on 17 March that France was not &quot;seeking to gain anything&quot; in the Zaire crisis. &quot;I do not believe that we have any real interests in this part of the world - we have duties&quot;, he said on France Info radio. A 30-member US military team arrived in west Africa today to make plans for a possible evacuation of US nationals from Zaire. The deployment, however, did not represent a commitment or intention by the US to deploy other forces in the region, said a Pentagon spokesperson. Some 650 US citizens live in Zaire. Germany also advised its 200 or so nationals - 130 of them based in Kinshasa - to leave Zaire for security reasons, but will see how the situation develops before deciding on an evacuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to Reuters, many residents in Lubumbashi - Zaire's second largest city and capital of the country's copper belt - say that they welcome the ADFL and promised little resistance to a rebel advance on the city. Some believe that the city will fall as early as the weekend. A Belgian expatriate told AFP &quot;they (the rebels) always make their decisive victories on Saturday - so this Saturday could be Lubumbashi's turn&quot;. Kabila had said, following the capture of Kisangani on Saturday, that Lubumbashi was his next target.  However, yesterday Kabila said that he may be tempted to head straight for Kinshasa or to the diamond capital of Mbuji-Mayi and bypass Lubumbashi, which lies only 30 kms as the crow flies from the border with Zambia. Some inhabitants, meanwhile, are reported by AFP to be taking precautions against looting or have left, some fleeing overland to Zambia. One source told AFP that the outflow was so great on Wednesday that the Zairean side of the border was closed for several hours to cope with the backlog. The daily Zaire Airlines flight to Kinshasa has been packed all week and Sunday's flight to Johannesburg was moved up to Wednesday. It was filled with women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An Ilyushin transport plane which landed in Kisangani on Wednesday with the first batch of relief food supplies since the city fell to the ADFL on Saturday was briefly delayed at the airport today following problems over the plane's paperwork. Officials from WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR and MSF flew from Goma to Kisangani again today to assess the situation in Kisangani and Ubundu, 100 kms to the south. At Ubundu, some 100,000 refugees have gathered on both sides of the river, many of them in poor condition. Kabila announced yesterday a one week ceasefire to facilitate assistance to the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Amnesty International has issued a statement expressing concern for the safety of nine men accused of involvement in a plot to assassinate the country's leader, Pierre Buyoya. The men, arrested on 8 and 9 March, are reported to have been tortured and at risk from further abuses. Amnesty says that although the men have also been accused of being responsible for a series of mine explosions in Bujumbura, they have not been properly charged with any offence. So far, at least 40 people, are reported to have been arrested in connection with last weeks alleged plot. The Amnesty statement says that it is investigating reports that the arrests may be politically motivated and may relate to the accused's membership or association with the PARENA party and its opposition to the current regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARENA's president Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, under house arrest since 19 January, has been outspoken in his criticism of Buyoya. Bagaza's father, who required medical treatment, was prevented from leaving the house and died.  The secretary-general of the Front pour la democratie au Burundi (FRODEBU), Augustin Nzojibwami, was arrested on 11 February and accused of subversion activities. He was subsequently released following a decision by Burundi's Supreme Court not to uphold the order. FRODEBU's executive secretary was detained for questioning in late February and tortured. Since Buyoya came to power in July last year, Amnesty says it has documented numerous cases of extrajudicial execution, arbitrary arrest and torture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Tunisia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brief description of the situation : The International Secretariat has been informed, by a reliable source, of the arrest and alleged torture of Miss Radhia Aouididi. Her arrest is believed to be related to her links with her fiance, a Tunisian political refugee in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to information received, Miss Radhia Aouididi was arrested on 9 November 1996 at Tunis-Carthage airport as she was about to board a plane to France to be reunited with her fiance. Miss Radhia Aouididi was apparently found to be in possession of a false passport. She is said to have been denied requests for a passport and her identity card had been confiscated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Radhia Aouididi was reportedly held incommunicado during a period exceeding the maximum 10-day limit to such detention under Tunisian law. On 9 January 1997, Miss Radhia Aouididi allegedly appeared before the examining magistrate for a second time, after the 10-day legal limit for police custody had been exceeded. It is alleged that Miss Radhia Aouididi was tortured and threatened with rape. She is currently being detained in Manouba Prison, in Tunis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Radhia Aouididi had previously been arrested and detained for a day or two, during which time she was interrogated about the political activities with the unauthorised Islamist party al-Nahda of her brother, Mr Nourreding Aouididi, an asylum-seeker in Europe. Her second brother, Mr Abdelaziz Aouididi, was reportedly arrested at the main police station in Sfax on or around 14 November 1996 when he went to find out his sister's whereabouts and her legal status. Mr Abdelaziz Aouididi was subsequently released. All passports of Miss Radhia Aouididi's family have been allegedly confiscated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 24 February 1997, the Tunisian weekly newspaper &quot;Realites&quot; published an article evoking Miss Radhia Aouididi's arrest, the responsibility of her fiance in organising her flight to France and the fact that she &quot;had lost her virginity before her arrest&quot;. Around 25 February 1997, Miss Radhia Aouididi's lawyer lodged a complaint against &quot;Realites&quot; for defamation, intrusion into her private life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should be noted that the International Secretariat wrote to the Tunisian Permanent Representative in Geneva setting out the facts and pointing out that the situation contravened the human rights international instruments to which Tunisia is party. This communication remained without reply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the allegations of torture, threats of rape and content of this newspaper article, the International Secretariat is gravely concerned over the respect of the physical and psychological integrity of Miss Radhia Aouididi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action requested : Please write to the Tunisian authorities urging them to :</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">i. guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Miss Radhia Aouididi and immediately inform her family of her personal and legal situation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ii. order her immediate release if she is detained without valid charges or, if such charges exist, bring her without delay before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee her procedural rights at all times;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iii. carry out an exhaustive and impartial enquiry into the facts, identify those responsible, bring them to justice and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law; iv</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with national laws and international standards.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa (ENA) - The Ministry of Mines and Energy disclosed yesterday that over 1,000 kg. of gold is smuggled out of the country annually produced by artisan gold producers only in Odo Shakisso Woreda, known for its high placer gold deposit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study conducted by the ministry on illegal production and trade of gold and other precious stones indicated that 30,000 to 40,000 artisan gold producers are illegally engaged in the business in the woreda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study revealed that illegal gold production is also rampant in Tigray, Metekel, Wollega, Assossa, Bench, Maji and Keficho areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the study, in the process of gold production by artisans, the amount wasted is greater than what is actually produced for lack of modern technology and know-how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry said the number of illegal producers, the magnitude of wastage and its subsequent impact could be far greater had the scope to the study was not limited to these areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artisan gold prospectors were given legal status, exempted from mining income tax and provided with technical assistance in line with proclamation Number 52/85, the study said, adding, the number of people engaged in illegal mining, however, has not dropped as expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study further revealed that some of them are not willing to be licensed and those who obtained licences prefer to sell the gold to illegal businessmen. The study attributed the problem to the absence of sound control strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the measures taken by the government to ward off the smuggling of gold out of the country and local gold wastage, was purchasing the gold from the artisans themselves for which the government allotted 10.8 million birr revolving fund since 1985 E.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 305 kg. of gold was purchased in the period between 1986 to 1989 E.C.  the study said, adding, the advantage will be only earning foreign exchange as the purchase will not be profitable due to competitions with businessmen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A rare disease related to smallpox has broken out in eastern Zaire, and threatens in particular children under 15. Monkeypox (French: Orthopoxvirose simienne), a viral infection acquired by humans from wild animals but occasionally spread through human contact, is reported from areas near Katako-Kombe, in the Sankuru region of eastern Kasai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the disease was identified in 1970, the vast majority of reported cases have occurred in Zaire. Between 1982-1986, 331 known cases were reported in Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A surveillance system was set up in late 1981 but had identified only small clusters of cases with little evidence of any inter-human transmission.  However, missions by experts from Medecins sans Frontieres Belgium, the World Health Organization and the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC), undertaken in August 1996 and followed up in February 1997, have found evidence of a more serious outbreak with possible public health implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's outbreak in Katako-Kombe started in February, but was only reported in July. Seventy-one cases were reported up to 30 August, of which six proved fatal. Specimens collected at the time and tested at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Smallpox and other Poxvirus Infections at the CDC, confirmed monkeypox infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An international mission was sent to Lodja and Katako-Kombe in the Sankuru region of Eastern Zaire from February 17 to March 1 1997 to investigate a possible further outbreak. The mission, which was led by the World Health Organization, included experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, the European Union, Medecins Sans Frontieres-Belgium (MSF) and local health and research authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, the second mission was interrupted because of the retreating Zairean soldiers (FAZ) who looted several of the affected villages, killing at least 30 people in Katako-Kombe following the rebel Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) advance on Kindu, some 280 kms east of Katako-Kombe. There is speculation that fleeing soldiers may become infected and spread the disease if they continue to travel beyond the area. Rapes by retreating FAZ soldiers have often been reported elsewhere in eastern Zaire, and might be a source of human to human monkeypox infection in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its premature end, WHO reported that the mission had identified some 98 cases. The average age of the victims was about 12. The illness has afflicted all ages from 1 month old to 62 years old, but children under 15 are the most susceptible. This is attributed to the fact that vaccinations against smallpox, which appear to provide some protection against monkeypox, were stopped some 15 years ago. Smallpox was widely considered to have been eradicated in 1980. Three-quarters of the cases examined by the team did not have the smallpox vaccination scar. Although the observed death to case ratio was 10% in the 80s, amongst 88 current cases that were traced only 3.4% had died by March 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, the viral infection was believed to be transmitted only from wild animals (its natural hosts include chimpanzees, monkeys and squirrels) to humans. However there is a high incidence of cases amongst family members and findings suggest that two-thirds of the current cases originated with other infected people. Monkeypox is now believed to be transmitted more through human contact than once thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possiblility of increased inter-human transmission coupled with the difficulty in reaching the affected areas in order to provide treatment increases the possibility that it will become a serious public health problem.  However, despite the rise in the number of cases, the WHO claims that actual inter-human transmission remains poor. A WHO report in 1988 states that the longest chain of human transmission appeared to be four person-to-person infections in a row without animal contact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the WHO and CDC, to prevent an escalation in the number of affected people all cases need to be isolated, and cared for by one person who is vaccinated against smallpox. Humanitarian sources claim this could be problematic given the current advancement of the war in Zaire. Moreover, aid workers are concerned that the possible arrival of the Rwandan refugees, who are for the most part in poor health and are currently fleeing towards Sankuru region, could contribute to an escalation in the number of cases and its spread. However, CDC cautions that &quot;it is not known whether this newly identified person to person transmission potential of the disease is sufficient for monkeypox to sustain itself in human populations in an area where there is no introduction of the virus from wild animals&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO also recommends that scratches from animals should be avoided, and that meat from wild animals should be eaten well-cooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO has requested that all suspected cases be reported immediately to the nearest WHO representation.</SPAN></P>
