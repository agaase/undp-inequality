<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 30, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A little-known struggle for independence continues in West Africa -- and South Africa has strange links to it. Ann Eveleth reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the presidential inauguration of Nelson Mandela on May 10 last year was heralded as the end of colonialism for a beleaguered continent, but nobody seemed to notice that one distinguished guest was celebrating a very different anniversary that day: the 21st birthday of the Front for the Liberation of Seguiet el-Hamra and Rio de Oro marked the continued resistance of the Sahrawi people to their status as Africa's last colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mohamed Abdelaziz, president of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) and secretary general of the Polisario Liberation Front, must have viewed the coincidence as a coming of age for his government-in- exile. Now that apartheid was gone, world attention could focus on freeing his tiny desert country from the ravages of two decades of Moroccan occupation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The emergence of a powerful new South Africa governed by Polisario's old ally -- the African National Congress -- would shift the balance of power in the United Nations toward the Sahrawis and bring an end to Moroccan King Hassan's dithering over the long-awaited independence referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Polisario has since turned 22, however, and neither the referendum nor formal recognition by South Africa have been forthcoming. Instead, there have been signs that the old South African-Moroccan alliance which fuelled the war of annexation is continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy President Thabo Mbeki made a mysterious visit to Morocco last year -- speculation was that he was fund- raising for the ANC -- and Mandela this month postponed a visit to the Sahara until he could arrange to visit both sides of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's Foreign Affairs Department has come under increasing criticism for this ambiguous stance -- which is all the more surprising given the parallels between the two liberation struggles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forced into what could be described as the arid interior bantustan of the western Saharan nation after Morocco's high-powered army annexed the 1 000km-long coastal belt on the eve of Sahrawi independence from colonial Spain in 1975, the Polisario fighters have defended the &quot;liberated zone&quot; with 19th century weapons and sheer pluck against a combined onslaught by up to 30 000 soldiers, aerial bombardments and napalm attacks targeting fleeing civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Housing the Sahrawi women and children in desolate refugee camps in the southern Algerian military zone around Tindouf, Polisario set up a government-in-exile and declared the independent Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in 1976. Its growing army was sent back into the desert to repel the occupiers' advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A nomadic people descended from a section of the 11th century Almoravid Dynasty which abandoned northward expansionism to return to the desert, the Sahrawi delivered countless staggering military blows to the well-endowed Moroccan army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, the Polisario fighters could reach little more than a stalemate with Hassan's warriors, who were armed to the teeth first by the French, and later by the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hassan's resolve strengthened as internal dissent against his corrupt, autocratic regime grew. He survived several assassination attempts from dissidents, and strikes and demonstrations were widespread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Amnesty International recorded thousands of cases of detention without trial of Moroccan dissidents, the monarch soon discovered he could divert attention from the domestic pressures wrought by massive income disparities through Morocco's desert war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite growing international pressure from the United Nations and the International Court of Justice for a referendum to determine the future of the Sahara, Hassan increased his forces in the occupied territory. By the time the two sides signed an uneasy ceasefire agreement in 1991, he had accumulated about 130 000 troops in &quot;Morocco's 41st province&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morocco's intransigence was bolstered annually by more than US$200-million to $500-million in military aid from Saudi Arabia, US$50-million from the US, and unknown covert assistance from South Africa's apartheid regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Successive UN resolutions however, pointed increasingly to the inevitability of a referendum, so Hassan adopted a new strategy. Hoping to weight the referendum in his favour, he began infiltrating thousands of Moroccan settlers into the occupied territory, claiming they were Saharan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refusing to allow UN personnel or foreign journalists to visit the occupied port city of El Aaiun, Hassan alternately blocked and rejected the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) -- and imprisoned genuine Sahrawis in the territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hassan's forces bombed a Sahrawi field hospital for nomads on the eve of the ceasefire agreement, reducing it to rubble. Refusing to grant passports to Sahrawis, detention without trial, torture and pressure on prisoners to renounce their claims to independence were just some of the means employed to prevent decolonisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The formation of a plethora of pro-Morocco &quot;Sahrawi&quot; political parties by Spain and Morocco failed to convince UN missions to the territory. But in the face of US foreign policy and divisions in the Organisation of African Unity, the UN was too weak to prevent the 176 ceasefire violations documented during the first year of the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morocco received a windfall in international support in 1991 when it backed the US war against Iraq. The international community remained largely silent after the 1991 Amnesty International report stated that 800 Sahrawis had &quot;disappeared&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And as these kudos continued to grow in the aftermath of the Gulf Oil War, Morocco grew bolder in its violations of the agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 30, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African journalists are struggling to find a unique voice in the face of Western stereotypes and diverse beliefs, writes Chris Louw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenyan journalist Charles Wachira walked around in the streets of Harare last week, shaking his head in disbelief. &quot;I never knew an African state like this existed,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Look at the roads, man. Not a single pothole! And the cars are all brand new. I'm shocked, man.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wachira was one of about 30 journalists from all over the continent who gathered in Zimbabwe to take stock of the state of journalism in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But finding a voice of its own for African journalism to counter the &quot;onslaught&quot; of the American and European media with their preconceptions, soon proved to be difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like Machira, most journalists found that Africa is just too big, too diverse, and the countries too isolated to be able to unanimously come up with indiginous definitions for concepts like &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;human rights&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the journalists were free-lancers, and almost all were loosely related to the Inter Press Service Third World News Agency (IPS), the fledgling organisation which for the past three decades has been trying bravely to give the South its own voice against the overwhelming communications networks of the Northern hemisphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting was soon sobered by Dr Ibbo Mandaza, editor-in-chief of the Harare-based Southern African Political and Economic Magazine, who reminded delegates that intra-regional trade in Africa amounted to a mere four percent of all African trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lambasting the northern countries for what he termed their neo-colonial approach to Africa, Mandaza maintained that all African countries were still forced to earn foreign currency by exporting their raw materials, thus undermining their industrial basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have a hostage economy, a subsidiary economy. There is no African state -- only a hostage state, a mimic state; it is a farce, to say the least.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most newspapers on the continent, said Mandaza, were forced to toe the line by governments who had little room for political and economic manoeuvering and consequently soon lost legitimacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One after the other the journalists confirmed what Mandaza was saying: many of those present had been detained or intimidated by their respective governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only the Northern media was accused of being biased against Africa. Zimbabwean feminist Dr Patricia McFadden accused African journalists of being the main culprits when it came to perpetuating stereotypes of women.  Women, she said, were seldom taken seriously by African publications as public figures in their own right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The difficulty faced in establishing commonly accepted moral guidelines for African journalism was graphically illustrated when delegates from Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire insisted that female circumcision, which is still prevalent in their countries, was an acceptable ritual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of human rights, and more particularly gender rights, led to a heated discussion. Female delegates were up in arms, accusing men of perpetuating the suppression of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The West African journalists stuck to their guns, maintaining that female circumcision could not be regarded an abuse of rights because so many women supported this ritual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But &quot;politically correct&quot; arguments also very often stranded on the hard rock of African realities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One example: Josephine Masimba, a Zimbabwean, establishes herself as a firm feminist in the gender debate. Later, she tells me of her experiences of police in Harare. She was having supper with her sister in a restaurant one evening and left to buy something from a pharmacy around the corner. On her return she was stopped by two policemen who accused her of &quot;loitering&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was arrested and taken to a police station where she was thrown into a cell. It was a Friday night and she knew she would spend the weekend in jail if she did not pay an admission of guilt fine. In the end she had no option but to pay 50 Zimbabwean dollars. &quot;According to police records,&quot; she says, &quot;I am now a self- confessed prostitute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while delegates complained about Northern media stereotyping of Africa as impoverished and woeful, most topics chosen by the delegates for discussion centred on exactly the same issues: desertification, cattle theft, the impact of the large-scale import of second- hand clothes on local economies ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of the conference each delegate gave a short account of the present political, social and economic situation in his or her country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jean-Baptiste Kayigamba from Rwanda focused on the genocide in his country. He has become cynical about the destructive forces of ethnicism, and says that he is an outsider in the country of his birth. A million people killed in the past two years ... the chairman had to stop him -- the delegates had only two minutes to summarise the woes of their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yohannes Abdi from Ethiopia talked about the crisis in neighbouring Somalia. Somalians are flowing into Ethiopia in their thousands to flee starvation in their own country, bringing with them poverty and social problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethnicity has a kinder flavour in his region. Soon, he says, Ethiopia will be divided in nine ethnic regions, most of them semi-independent, &quot;states on their own,&quot; according to Abdi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abdoulaye Gandema from Burkina Faso listened to what everyone else had to say. In his country, if only 20 000 head of cattle were to be stolen, the economy would grind to a halt. Like so many African countries, the 'Land of the Upright People' is caught in the humiliating grip of poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &gt;From Nigeria, Remi Oyo complained about the pervasive corruption; from Zambia, Joe Chilaizya said his people are cynical about their democratically-elected rulers - - some people are even re-saddling old man Kenneth Kaunda with their hopes for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &gt;From Kenya, Charles Wachira tells of an opposition party led by a white man, Richard Leakey. &quot;The question now is: do we want to be ruled by someone of our own skin-colour who is not reliable, or do we prefer to be ruled by a white Kenyan whose actions pass the test of transparency?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost everyone refers to fears about the economic might of South Africa. Castle Lager is drunk all over Africa now; South African businesspeople move into Africa &quot;very aggressively&quot;. Fragile local industries will just not be able to withstand the capitalist onslaught from the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is soon clear that Africa is a continent caught up in woes. A journalist's paradise, if you will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last word goes to a Zimbabwean receptionist. Kenya's Charles Wachira tells him one night: &quot;Your country really functions very effectively, man. You must be sure not to let it go to the dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The receptionist, a mild-mannered, middle-aged Shona, flashes an angry smile: &quot;That's where the country was, Sir. But we took it back from the dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 30, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aziz Pahad, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, rejects the claim that his is the least effective government department, reports Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africans are still extremely parochial and the Department of Foreign Affairs cannot be expected to act aggressively to protect human rights internationally if its citizens are complacent, says Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Aziz Pahad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning the tables on the department's critics, he asked what the rest of South Africa was doing to stop human rights abuses in East Timor, Sudan and anywhere else they may be happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pahad was responding to criticisms of his department from parliamentarians and and academics published in the Mail &amp; Guardian, who slated it for being the least effective and least transparent in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the speed at which South Africa entered the arena of international affairs had been breathtaking. Within six months after April 1994, South Africa was readmitted to the United Nations and its organs, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the Commonwealth, the South African Development Community and the Non Aligned Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &gt;From May to December 1994, South Africa established relations with 35 countries and more than 160 foreign trade delegations visited the country in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't need to get too philosophical about foreign policy. Our mission is clear -- we need to reflect the nation's position internationally, protect the interests of South Africa and South Africans internationally and ensure that the new South Africa is able to participate in the New World Order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our responsibility is to protect human rights, democracy and good governance internationally and transform the world situation from its present position in which rich countries get richer and the poorer get poorer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He rejected the criticism that the Department of Foreign Affairs was Eurocentric in its approach because more money had been budgeted for its missions in the first world than in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From the time we came into government we have been saying consistently that South Africa is not a European outpost, it is an African country. But we have to be practical, we have to establish links with countries that can help us achieve our economic objects and further the RDP project.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pahad said now that South Africa had established a presence in many African countries, it will begin to play a more proactive role on the continent, particularly in assisting in the resolution of conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We must not be too romantic about the problems in Africa. We have to look at the continent pragmatically, learn where our interests lie, before pouring money into embassies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said it would also be foolish to ignore the fact that South Africa's major economic links were with the European Union, the country's largest investment partner. At the same time, the department was mindful of the economic opportunities opening in Africa, Asia and South America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela's visits targeting Africa and the Middle East were not &quot;accidental&quot;, they were aimed at exploiting the potential in those areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whether we like it or not, foreign policy is driven by economics.  Diplomatic relations with a country does not mean an acceptance of its internal politics -- they are state to state links, not state to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This means that while we can oppose the human rights policies of a country, we often cannot afford not to have a relationship with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controversy over South Africa's links with Indonesia and Sudan could be seen in this light. Pahad said the South African government had taken up the issue of the occupation of East Timor with the Indonesian government. This was done publicly and privately during Mandela's visit and by calling in the ambassador of Indonesia for a note verbal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He questioned what other political parties and political organisations were doing to rally South Africans to condemn Indonesia's actions, saying the department could not take up political platforms on such issues -- that responsibility lay with civil society which could be far more aggressive than diplomats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pahad said South Africans were still very parochial and could reflect the greatness of their nation by showing a far greater concern for other countries. The mindset that South Africa was too beset by its owns problems to assist others had to be broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign affairs were also not the preserve of diplomats and officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, a misapprehension which developed under the previous government. Every cabinet minister was at liberty to act on the foreign stage to pursue the objectives of their line function, provided they were briefed by the department first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Department of Foreign Affairs' role is to coordinate and assist them. The presidency, especially, is expected to play a leading role in international affairs. It would be foolhardy for us not to take advantage of the president -- South Africa's main marketer -- and his deputies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pahad promised that the Department of Foreign Affairs would publish a green paper &quot;soon&quot; and would draft it in consultation with academics, trade unions, political parties and the private sector. The document would give a vision of South Africa's policy well into the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to the criticism that the department was still dominated by a white, male staff, Pahad said the new government inherited six components of Foreign Affairs -- the existing Department of Foreign Affairs, the ANC's Department of International Affairs (DIA) and the TBVC departments of Foreign Affairs which had to be merged into one new department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's foreign operatives had worked in more countries than those of the former South African government, although their activities were limited to mobilising support for anti-apartheid activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The DIA personnel were probably the most experienced foreign affairs operatives. The ANC had more offices internationally than the old South African government and its staff interacted on various levels,&quot; Pahad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But we couldn't ignore the fact that there was an existing Department of Foreign Affairs, we were not prepared to make political appointments and we were committed to integrating the TBVC foreign affairs staff.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Ann Eveleth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Greater Durban Television (GDTV), South Africa's first regular community access television station, is up and running, charting new waters in public broadcasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GDTV is operating under a temporary licence granted to a coalition of community-based video groups by the Independent Broadcasting Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GDTV took to the airwaves last week with a range of community-based videos from church organisations, community groups and in-house videos filmed in the station's studio on the University of Natal's Durban campus (UND).  Broadcasting from a borrowed radiation laboratory at the university, GDTV hopes to de-mystify TV broadcasting and generate wide community participation in a project aimed at &quot;bringing Durban closer together&quot; through video.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kubeshni Govender, a freelance video producer and media studies masters student at UND, who represents the Film and Allied Workers Organisation (Fawo) on the station's steering committee, said GDTV was open to &quot;anyone from the community with an interest in broadcasting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Govender sees the station as the natural extension of a video training project Fawo has run over the past four years for members of disadvantaged communities: &quot;Fawo has trained over 100 people by now ... this is the ideal opportunity for those people to put their training into practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Run by a coalition including Fawo, the UND Centre for Cultural and Media Studies, Audio-Visual Alternatives and Durban Arts, and deriving volunteers from Natal Technikon's Department of Video Technology, UND media and drama students and Fawo trainees, the station provides training to volunteers in the use of studio equipment and sends crews out to film videos of local events, such as plays and music performances. GDTV representative Mike Aldridge said this demonstrated the power of media as &quot;a way of linking people up and bringing them together across the divides in our society&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Programming this week also included a broad range of shows on subjects ranging from vivisection to censorship to the art of Zulu storytelling, or Izinganekwane, encouraging calls from a number of viewers who picked up the signal from Durban North to Pinetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aldridge predicted the station would also provide a major boost to the local video industry, with local small businesses seeking production of advertisement videos for screening on the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'In terms of the RDP, this could help small, medium and micro- enterprises to grow. Not every business can afford to advertise on SABC, so we should look at developing an integrated approach which combines community broadcasting with the commercial or business side,&quot; said Aldridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Govender said the group was still trying to raise funds to sustain the project on a long-term basis -- and pinning hopes on government subsidies in support of the RDP -- she added that: &quot;The great thing about public access TV is that it doesn't require the kind of expensive equipment used in a regular station.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sparsely equipped studio appears very basic, yet GDTV has broadcast five hours of programming daily with the aid of a single 486 computer, nine monitors, two SVHS video tape players, a production mixer, edit controller, camera and a tiny microwave link that looks like little more than a glorified antenna hooked outside -- all donated by companies like Panasonic, Orbicom and Sentech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GDTV joined the airwaves last Thursday, and is licenced to continue broadcasting on channel 43 until July 11.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 23, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sam Ramsamy is now on the IOC and there is other good news for Cape Town's Olympic bid, writes Julian Drew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After several months earlier this year when the Cape Town Olympic Bid seemed to be on a kamikaze course of self destruction, followed by a period of quiet uncertainty, South Africa's delegation to the annual session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Budapest returned with some positive news this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps the most positive happening in Hungary was the election of National Olympic Committee of South Africa (Nocsa) president Sam Ramsamy onto the IOC, but it was by no means the only good news to come our way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accompanying Ramsamy on his trip were Chris Ball, the newly appointed CEO of the Cape Town Bid Committee, Clive Keegan, its vice-president, and Ngconde Balfour, a member of the new committee and vice-chairman of the preceding interim bid committee. &quot;Although people weren't saying directly that they would vote for us there was a very positive feeling about Cape Town's bid and we didn't experience any negative vibes whatsoever,&quot; said Ramsamy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While bad publicity had reached the rest of the world about Cape Town's bid problems, Ramsamy believes the damage was minimal. &quot;The international perceptions from what I gathered were that they'd heard about Ackerman's resignation and things like that but the news hadn't all been negative. They know we've had problems but they also know that we have now sorted them out. The fact that I introduced Chris Ball to everybody showed that we have sorted things out and they were all very impressed with him,&quot; said Ramsamy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another positive aspect according to Ramsamy was the way in which he and the other three South Africans worked so well together. &quot;I would often only receive two invitations to functions which meant I could only take one of the other three with me,&quot; said Ramsamy. &quot;Ngconde and Clive would always say 'Take Chris, he's the most important person', and that augers very well for the bid because people are already working as a team,&quot; he claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There was a sentiment in favour of Cape Town and a sentiment in favour of Africa. There were a lot of personal friendships because of Sam's long involvement in international sport but there was also an awareness that we have to deliver on the technical side. We stand a very good chance of winning the bid and that is a position a lot of other cities would love to be in,&quot; said Ball from Cape Town this week before jetting out to London for a short holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The first thing we must work on now is getting the support of the people in Cape Town and the rest of the country because we are not simply entitled to their support. Until we give them the necessary information that won't happen, but I'm reluctant to divulge anything just yet until I'm satisfied that the information that's released will not change. But there will be an announcement soon,&quot; said Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramsamy's membership of the IOC means that he will be able to study first hand the bids of other cities for the 2004 Olympic Games because he will be invited to visit them all as an IOC member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I will be able to study the strengths and weaknesses of all the other cities and relay this information to Cape Town. From this I should also be able to point out Cape Town's weaknesses so that we can try and sort them out,&quot; said Ramsamy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;More significantly, I will become a voting member of the IOC which means that Cape Town is guaranteed at least one vote,&quot; he declared, tongue in cheek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Membership of the IOC will eventually bring more responsibilities to Ramsamy who already regularly puts in a 16 hour working day at Nocsa, but he doesn't see any immediate problems with his work load. &quot;I will still spend most of my time with Nocsa and I believe I can do that without sacrificing any of my IOC responsibilities simply because the one dovetails into the other so well. About 20 IOC members are presidents of their Olympic committees. I think one role actually complements the other,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although many IOC members have a reputation of living it up and travelling the world on visits to bidding cities or on other IOC business, Ramsamy will not be joining the bandwagon. &quot;I will only take the mandatory visits. I will only do what is absolutely necessary,&quot; he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramsamy currently chairs the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (Anoca) Commission on Communication and Publicity and has been asked to sit on the Association of National Olympic Committees (Anoc) Technical Committee and when he does get asked to serve on any of the IOC's commissions he could find himself overloaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Help is at hand, however, and the Nocsa management committee is already considering appointing a CEO to take over some of Ramsamy's administrative tasks. &quot;We need someone with a good business acumen who will also have the respect of the staff and know something about sport. We won't just fill the position for the sake of it but we are head hunting right now,&quot; says Ramsamy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think a CEO would be useful because it will free me from a lot of daily routine and allow me to do other work on behalf of Nocsa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One task the former lifesaver has already committed himself to is relinquishing the presidency of Swimming South Africa next year. Hopefully he will also use his aquatic skills to keep his head above water until the management committee finds the right man to reduce his burden at Nocsa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 23, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meshack Mabogoane reports on the saga that has been played out at National Sorghum Breweries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Sorghum Breweries (NSB) has teamed up with Indian brewing giant, United Brewery International (UB).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deal means NSB will now produce the Indian brewer's Kingfisher Lager at Vivo's brewery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The joint venture marks the most extensive Indian investment in South Africa to date, and it will perhaps give NSB the muscle it needs to face up to its powerful rival South African Breweries (SAB).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UB will buy 30 percent of NSB's equity with the option of increasing its shareholding. A Memorandum of Understanding between NSB and UB includes a &quot;significant role&quot; for UB in the management of NSB.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UB, which has a R3,8-billion turnover, will also &quot;undertake the training of NSB's employees at its various plants overseas&quot; as well as evolving a management exchange scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most significantly UB will produce its brands at the Vivo plant. This will widen the range of clear beers in the NSB stable, adding more competition to this already crowded market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deal hopefully marks the end of the beleaguered NSB's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990, NSB's high-profile chairman, Mohale Mahanyele, threw down the gauntlet to SAB, apparently unaware of what befell Louis Luyt and Anton Rupert's group when they tried to carve a niche in the lucrative beer sector in the Seventies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mahanyele made daring statements about hiving off 20 percent of the clear beer market from SAB, which holds about 98 percent of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vivo Breweries came on line with sorghum serving as the milch cow -- NSB had more than 85 percent of the 1,2- billion-litre annual sorghum beer production, giving it a turnover of R600-million. The beer market is largely black turf and Mahanyele counted on black support, presumably along the lines of the erstwhile Afrikaner saamstaan. Unfortunately, there have as yet been no cheers from the market and Vivo flows sluggishly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1992, NSB diversied into the food industry, a strategic and seemingly wise move since trends indicated a long-term decline in sorghum.  However, all NSB's ventures into food and beverages -- Ting a Mabele, Soul Foods, NSB Mageu -- came to nought. Hopes were pinned on Jabula Foods, bought from Premier, but they were soon dashed by consumer changes and loss of outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only the soft drink division, producer of Pride Cola, is making some modest gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This leaves sorghum as the last, great hope to keep the company afloat. But, the 1990 agreement, which gave NSB the sole right to sell sorghum in the prime urban areas while keeping its competitors locked in the former, poor homelands, is due for revocation in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already SAB's sorghum division, Traditional Beer Investments (TBI), which claims 20percent of the market, in spite of the restrictions, is planning to increase its share to 30 percent. Other small brewers may be waiting on the sides to slice off more portions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the huge Vivo investments, a hefty chunk being bank loans, have begun to weigh heavily. It is understood that its main creditor, Nedbank, has taken an interest in finding suitors to salvage its debtor. So, too, have the Liquor Industry Association and the Taverners Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foodcorp, whose products include mageu, and black investment group Thebe, formed a rescue consortium, which has since been withdrawn. The consortium offered capital (up to 60 percent of equity), distribution networks and expertise, as well as internships for NSB's staff at Foodcorp.  But, demands were made to close Vivo and to restructure management -- this involved separating the roles of chairman and chief executive, a move intended to curtail the power of Mahanyele. NSB, which had initiated the talks, declined, indicating the hold Mahanyele, its founder and driving force, has on the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the UB deal, NSB is not out of the woods. Judging by past experiences in the liquor industry the scene is set for an intense &quot;beer war&quot; reminiscent of the Seventies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sceptics are apprehensive about the new partnership. NSB's rejection of offers from two companies rooted in South Africa -- the one in the food and beverages sector, the other at the centre of black economic empowerment -- is viewed as a missed opportunity to bring in local resources and relevant experience. Whether an oriental brewer, with less tradition and expertise than the European and American brewers that baulked at the prospect of taking on SAB, will succeed is moot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Mahanyele's gamble may well pay off. With an increase in NSB's clear beer brands, a broader net would be cast in the market. But most interesting is the racial element. The local Indian community could lend both its distribution network and group loyalty to ethnic ventures. Africans may yet follow this example. And should NSB offer quality products, brand loyalties and consumer behaviour may change. Demand for clear beer will rise along with living standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NSB's long-term prospects thus look better. Even a 10 percent market share, half of Mahanyele's ambition, realised initially through regional concentration, would make it a sizable player. With the other brewers -- Bavaria and Sterling -- its share of small and medium size clear beer producers could well be 20 percent, a significant cut. Perhaps developments in the soft drink sector, where Pepsi and smaller cola producers are making real inroads, could be repeated in the beer industry. Mahanyele's undoubted shewdness, tenacity, vision and drive may pay off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those seeking a deconcentration of business, or real competition, without overt government intervention through anti-trust measures, should view NSB's struggles with interest. It covers all the key issues in South African business now: it is a privatised company, embodies black economic empowerment, involves massive corporate restructuring, underlines the difficulty of competition with an efficient near monopoly, and might yet present the government with a dilemma if it fails completely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NSB is a test case. The first, most conspicous, genuinely black-managed of the new &quot;black&quot; giants is perhaps fated for this role. Its saga may provide a classic case study of the vicissitudes of black enterprise as it struggles to enter the mainstream.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 23, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Simon Segal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Compared to our survey at the beginning of the year, South Africa's major economic forecasters have slightly scaled down their economic growth forecasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On average, the 10 forecasting units now expect gross domestic product (GDP) to grow 2,9 percent this year and 3,3 percent next year. GDP estimates at the beginning of the year averaged 3,1 percent for 1995 and 3,32 percent for 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GDP grew 2,3 percent last year and 1,1 percent in 1993. So, by consensus, South Africa is still on track for four consecutive years of economic growth for the first time since the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most optimistic unit is Old Mutual which expects growth rates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of 3,3 percent and four percent this year and next respectively. Most pessimistic is Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa) (2,5 and two percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six units expect the economy to gain momentum next year and two (Frankel Pollak and Absa) expect it to lose steam. The remaining two, Sanlam and the Afrikanse Handelsinstituut, forecast the same growth for 1995 and 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frankel Pollak and Absa are thus the only two units which expect the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments to fall next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most dramatic turnaround in the forecasts is with the current account. An average deficit of R7,5-billion and R8,7-billion is pencilled in for 1995 and 1996 respectively, compared to a shortfall of R4,2-billion and R6,3-billion estimated at the beginning of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deficit projections for this year range from the South African Chamber of Business' (Sacob) R5-billion to Sanlam's R10-billion. For next year the spread is R5,5- billion (Frankel Pollak) to R12-billion (Sanlam).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All units except Sacob expect an inflation rate of 10,5 to 12,2 percent both this year and next. Sacob is looking at nine percent this year and 8,5 percent next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On interest rates, seven of the 10 units expect a percentage point increase in prime rate (at present 17,5 percent) this year and six of them see a further percentage point rise by the end of next year. Only Sacob expects interest rates to start falling next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Old Mutual and Frankel Pollak are right, prime rate will reach 20,5 percent next year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Writing stories on the sex lives of presidents has become a dangerous occupation for Southern African journalists, writes David Lush</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just last month, the publisher and two editors of Zimbabwe's Financial Gazette were arrested, interrogated and charged with an offence which has hardly seen the light of day since the fall of Ian Smith's Rhodesia -- all because of a story alleging that President Robert Mugabe had married his secretary, which he later admitted to anyway.</SPAN></P>

Chiluba -- a born-again Christian who has publicly urged Zambians to be monogamous -- denies ever knowing the woman, nor the child she claims he fathered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following publication of this story, leaders and supporters of Chiluba's Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) took to the streets, burning copies of The Post and threatening to beat up anyone found selling the paper. M'membe was arrested at the paper's Lusaka offices on Monday morning, and both M'membe and his editor-in-chief, Masautso Phiri, spent the night in jail before appearing in court, charged with defaming the president under Section 69 of the Penal Code.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elias Rusike, Trevor Ncube and Simba Makunike, respectively the publisher, editor and deputy-editor of Zimbabwe's Financial Gazette, endured similar police hospitality for a story claiming that President Mugabe had married his secretary. Shortly after first light on May 13, detectives swooped on the homes of Rusike, Ncube and Makunike and took the three in for questioning, and trashing their offices in the process. After more than 48 hours in police detention, the three executives appeared in court, charged with criminal defamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While outrage at the Gazette's revelations has been confined largely to the environs of State House, even fellow journalists feel The Post went too far with its story. Respected media academic and chair of the Zambian press association, Francis Kasoma, told IPS that the development of press freedom in Zambia had reached a &quot;dangerous stage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To a lesser extent, The Namibian newspaper has also suffered moral whiplash for publishing details of The Post's story during Chiluba's state visit to Namibia last week. Callers to radio phone-in shows urged the Namibian government to act against journalists responsible for causing the nation such an &quot;embarrassment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the close of his Namibian trip last Saturday, Chiluba reiterated his pledge not to muzzle the Zambian press, but added that it was not for the media to &quot;create rules for democracy&quot;. &quot;Even if leaders are wrong, it is not African to insult them in public,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe -- a distinctly African, self-confessed Zambian patriot -- disagrees. &quot;Even the ruthless Zulu dictator Chaka could be criticised openly,&quot; M'membe wrote in an article published by the Media Institute of Southern Africa in December. &quot;Whenever a voice of opposition is raised ...  the first instinct of African leaders is to smear it with the filth of colonialism, capitalism or imperialism.&quot; Or in M'membe's case, Section 69 of the Penal Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a report published in January, Amnesty International criticised Zambia and Zimbabwe, together with Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda -- countries related by legal systems shaped by British colonial rule -- for criminalising dissent through the use of often out-dated legislation which contravened international human rights standards. &quot;The use of such charges is often as much about restriction and intimidation as prosecution and actual imprisonment,&quot; said the Amnesty report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 23, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rugby World Cup has been an enormous success as a catalyst for the kind of national unity which is possible in South Africa, writes Jon Swift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rugby World Cup is going to be a very hard act to follow. It is a point of national focus which has ranged from the sublime of the emotion-charged opening at Newlands in Cape Town exactly a month ago, to the farcical Leon Schuster song celebrating the South African team, Hier Kommie Bokke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all, organisers estimate that just over a million of the total 1,38-million seats for the 16-nation tournament will have been filled with people paying anything between R44 and R220 for a chance to watch one of the 32 matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exercise will raise something approaching a staggering R100-million from tickets alone, and probably half as much again from the trade in T-shirts, ashtrays and other paraphernalia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More important than the eventual bottom line, though, has been the thread which has drawn the diverse interests of this rainbow nation towards the fortunes of 15 men in green-and-gold jerseys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Viewership figures in this country have still to be fully analysed, but indications are that the TV sets have been switched on to rugby as often in Soweto as in Sandton and as enthusiastically in Phola Park as Putsonderwater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While this new-found interest will pump much needed blood into the oft-criticised lifelessness of rugby's development programme, there has been a spin-off -- related directly to TV viewership -- of arguably far greater importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For, intriguingly, the World Cup has brought the white minority closer to the ideals of our new democracy, by the almost unreserved support of all sectors of the community for the squad who espouse the ethic of &quot;one team, one country&quot;, than any past political assurances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has been led from the front by our state president, who embraced the South African team as &quot;my sons&quot;, donning a cap adorned with the leaping Springbok emblem and putting his unreserved support behind the side -- when, in the past, as he admits, he would always have supported the opposing team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this, the president has not been alone. The scandalous barrage of bottles which rained down on the &quot;non-white&quot; sector of the stand at Ellis Park during the visit of the 1960 All Blacks because the disenfranchised had the timerity to cheer the New Zealanders is part of the legacy of division the game has historically symbolised for the citizens of this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For many, this legacy will take a lifetime to erase. For others, like the president, the present leads directly to a better and brighter future.  The Rugby World Cup has been an enormous success as a catalyst for the kind of national unity which is possible in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that Mandela would don the badge which was for so many years a symbol of apartheid is just one sign of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For some, Francois Pienaar's insistence as captain that all the members of the team know the words of Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika as well as they do Die Stem has put the game beyond the pale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the majority, though, this has been cause for celebration, an indication that our internal emphases are indeed changing from the narrow constraints of the old towards an all-embracing acceptance of the new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Along these lines, too, it has been heartening to note the acceptance of C te d'Ivoire in the heart of Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging country. The crowds at Rustenburg's Olympia Park took the luckless Africans into their hearts, waving Ivorian flags and supporting them in both face-paint and numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equally heartening has been the national response -- through the South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu), the Chris Burger Fund and a national hotel chain, among others --to the sad plight of Max Brito's tragic fracture of the neck and subsequent paralysis of the Ivorian player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same applied to the Japanese team in Bloemfontein, the capital of the province which used to give people of Asian descent no more than the glancing courtesy of a 24-hour right of passage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is as if this country had awoken from a dreamless sleep and suddenly discovered that there are others of whatever lineage worthy of support who come from beyond our borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has not held true, however, when the South Africans have been involved. There the support has been as one-eyed and partisan as it always was, from the euphoria of South Africa's 27-18 win over Australia in the opening burst, to the nail-biting vasbyt of the last quarter hour's siege by the French at the rain- lashed King's Park semi-final last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been as if the game which once typified white domination had magically drawn all sectors towards the centre and opened a new path, shown a new direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nation has agonised with James Dalton and Pieter Hendriks, and, to judge by the fury of the phone-ins to talk radio, failed to grasp the fact that they had been found guilty as charged after the bloody brawl at Boet Erasmus Stadium in the game against Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country rejoiced in the fact that Chester Williams came back into the side he had disqualified himself from (due to injury) before the start of the tournament. And we went into a frenzy of delight when the winger celebrated his return with four superb tries in the combat zone of the 42-14 victory against Western Samoa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether this jubilation will hold in the all-too-likely event of an All Black victory in the final at Ellis Park remains to be seen. But the game, the people and the country as a whole will surely have benefitted enormously from the whole experience.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 23, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A former security policeman opens his bag of dirty tricks. Eddie Koch and Stefaans Brummer report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The State Security Council under former President FW de Klerk created a four-year plan to undermine and weaken the ANC and its allies in the build-up to the 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Details of the extensive dirty tricks plan, planned to run from 1990 to 1994, have been revealed by a former policeman deeply involved in it, Warrant Officer Paul Erasmus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erasmus' evidence, including information he has given to the Goldstone Commission, would have a major impact on the Government of National Unity, since it reflects on De Klerk's conduct during negotiations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erasmus worked for the Witwaters-rand branch of Stratcom, the State Security Council arm which specialised in intelligence gathering and dirty tricks. He was personally involved in tapping the phones of and recruiting sources in the ANC as late as October 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Stratcom was officially disbanded after the Mail &amp; Guardian expose of the Inkathagate scandal in 1991, most of the front companies had been made self- sufficient and were allowed to continue independently. They ceased getting police money, but were allowed to keep their personnel, resources and premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No orders went out to stop their activities, merely to break official contact with them --and some of them continued operating until as recently as this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erasmus was a long-standing security policeman who was given special Stratcom training in August 1990, six months after the unbanning of the ANC and the release of Nelson Mandela. On the course, they were told they had four years before the first democratic election in which to make sure the ANC was &quot;reduced to just another political party&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Stratcom had to consider identified target areas within the ANC, for example finances, and actions had to be taken to highlight the shortcomings and failures of the organisation with the ultimate aim of forcing Mandela to back down at the negotiating table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were, according to Erasmus, &quot;soft&quot; Stratcom activities -- projects with defined and &quot;legal&quot; aims -- and &quot;hard&quot; activities, &quot;tactics such as murder, assassination, sabotage, breaking and entering, theft, planting of evidence and blackmail, subversion and a host of other activities in the 'national interest'&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stratcom answered to the State Security Council, on which De Klerk and other NP leaders, such as Pik Botha, Roelf Meyer, Adriaan Vlok and Hernus Kriel, all sat. In addition, Stratcom projects in areas such as education had to be approved by the relevant minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erasmus has provided details of a number of projects aimed at the ANC, its women's and youth leagues, individuals within them such as Winnie Mandela and Peter Mokaba, and the SA Communist Party. These included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Romulus, &quot;covert action to put pressure on the ANC/SACP&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Operation Gordian, &quot;to minimise the effectiveness of the ANC Youth League and Sayco&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Operation Jackal, &quot;neutralising the ideological influence of radical organisations ... in secondary and tertiary institutions&quot;. The flagships of this project were the Students Moderate Alliance and the Afrikaans National Student Federation, set up to counter the influence of Nusas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Operation Olympia, to recruit high school kids as a way of dealing with the increasing difficulty they had in finding sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Operation Ram, including a letter writing project, aimed at getting Stratkom views into the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Operation Einstein, aimed at coloured education institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Omega, aimed at labour and under which the IFP union, Uwusa, was founded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Wigwam, the biggest of all, aimed at countering and neutralising the ANC, PAC, SACP, Cosatu as well as the far-rightwing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erasmus was involved in these projects, working from the offices of a front company in Randburg, until late 1991, when he transferred to the Southern Cape. There he worked for the Central Intelligence Services, which he says merely took over the work of the disbanded security police. Erasmus' documents reveal extensive surveillance, phone tapping, mail interception and the recruitment of sources in the ANC in the area as late as October 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erasmus' Stratcom work also stretched overseas. A major part of it was to spread anti-ANC propaganda in countries being visited by Mandela in a bid to damage his chances of raising money for his party. This was done in Britain, the United States and Japan, mostly by feeding anti-ANC information to the media and friendly organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erasmus worked extensively with a Scottish member of the Conservative Party's rightwing Monday Club, Harvey Ward, to feed information to MP's and other prominent British figures. Some of these were aware of the origin of the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also worked with an American foundation, the Short Forum, to counter the ANC in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brigadier Zirk Gous, now head of police community relations in the Witwatersrand, but named by Erasmus as head of Stratcom intelligence, yesterday said Stratcom was &quot;a structured operation for a limited time period 1990-1992&quot; and was then formally disbanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Stratcom documents make it clear that it was formed in 1984 and Erasmus' evidence suggests that some of its work continued informally after 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erasmus left the police force in 1993, angry and disillusioned, he and his family &quot;having been victimised by a corrupt commanding officer&quot;. &quot;I became one of the first policemen to sue the minister for the loss of my career. As a result, I became the target of dirty tricks, disinformation and received information that previous colleagues were going to kill me, my wife and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The commissioner, General Johan van der Merwe, personally ordered a massive investigation into my whole career, fearing, I believe, that I would reveal covert operations. I am prepared to accept responsibility for deeds that I carried out in the total onslaught era and after 1990, but I find it impossible to accept that my wife and innocent children should suffer in actions which were to be implemented against me. It was only when this vicious system turned on me when I realised what I had been doing to the white left for all those years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't regad myself as another Dirk Coetzee or a traitor. However, I believe that unless the evils of the past are exposed, they may be perpetuated in the future,&quot; Erasmus said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He later gave evidence to the Goldstone Commission, where he was put on a witness protection programme and flown overseas for his safety. He was codenamed Q4, one of the key witnesses in Judge Richard Goldstone's expose of third force activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erasmus' wife, however, is on record as being sharply critical of their treatment by the Goldstone Commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 16, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M-Net corporate affairs manager Cawe Mahlati, tells Aspasia Karras how she hopes to see M-Net become the frontrunner of global broadcasting in Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Articulate and determined, M-Net corporate affairs manager Cawe Mahlati is a force to be reckoned with in private broadcasting. Not only does she have a vision of what broadcasting can become in the future, but she believes that the impetus of the future is already here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As corporate affairs manager of M-Net, and an executive board member, she feels it is her duty to ensure that everybody else is aware of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The self-declared &quot;rural Transkeian girl&quot; believes that the information age is not exacerbating the divide between the third and first worlds, but is rather a bridging opportunity: &quot;We have moved beyond atoms and into bytes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, she says, has astounding consequences for our lives. Mahlati sees the information highway as a viable method with which to alleviate bureaucratic problems which hold up rural development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her excitement for her industry drives the representations she has being making at the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) hearings, as she takes part in the sensitive debate around restrictions, structural changes and local content, and ultimately the future of private broadcasting in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Wherever there is change there is opportunity,&quot; she says. She contends broadcasting has traditionally been a single- territory-based industry represented by local national channels, but increasingly it is becoming global, and so the &quot;product&quot; should become global in nature. The various regulatory authorities should be aware of this tendency, and legislate for the future rather than in response to the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M-Net is being beamed into 42 African countries, an achievement which Mahlati feels is in line with international trends. Ultimately, her vision for M-Net as a forerunner of the globalising tendency in Africa depends on the IBA's approach to M-Net's proposals. Mahlati says: &quot;If the IBA does not follow models like the French one then we are likely to see Gauteng becoming the nodal point of a South African broadcasting industry that could generate great wealth and strategic power for South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She believes that the IBA is obliged to help create an &quot;enlightened&quot;, vibrant and sustainable broadcasting industry and should, therefore, not be concerned with the local production industry, but rather with the broadcasters that can take the industry into the 21st century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this regard M-Net resists a local-content quota. Its compromise is a specified sum allocated to local productions, escalated annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. This approach, she argues, is the only viable option for her pay channel which will soon have to compete with international pay channels. &quot;We would be completely unable to produce the international quality show Egoli if we had quotas to fulfil, as essentially this would mean more local content but inevitably poor quality productions,&quot; she maintains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As to the pending influx of competition, Mahlati says: &quot;We welcome competition. It increases efficiency as consumers have a choice, but M-Net is laying its plans to ensure that it offers the most competitive product around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She says M-Net's recent unbundling is part of the global plan.  Essentially the company is following an international trend of downsizing and narrowing focus to become more efficient and productive. She believes M-Net's ultimate concern is to satisfy its customers, so programming has to conform to the needs of the customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mahlati says her career has been a series of coincidences that has taken her on a heady journey to success. Her life reads like a high-powered Egoli fantasy, starting with her graduation from Inanda Seminary in Durban, &quot;a high school run by militant American feminists who basically came to Africa to train African women to take up positions of leadership&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next came a law degree -- she studied at the Universities of Lesotho and Edinburgh -- as well as a course in international relations and diplomacy in Austria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She is worldly and cultured: she spent time in New York both as an exchange student and working for IBM as an associate attorney, and pursued her diplomatic career in Austria, Zimbabwe and Transkei. She expresses a deep love for the opera, dance and percussion instruments, all of which she believes are excellent mediums for cross-cultural pollination. She recalls fondly M-Net's support of a dance production called Gumboot Flamenco de Africa and she supports avidly the West Indian festival that takes place every year in London and New York.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 16, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As South Africa scraps the death penalty, the ANC alliance is fighting to save the life of an American journalist on death row, writes Bruce Cohen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African National Congress, the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions have joined in the fight to halt the execution of an American journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal, 40, who has spent 13 years on death row for killing a Philadelphia policeman -- a crime he denies -- received his death warrant two weeks ago from Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He will be executed by lethal injection on August 17.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day Ridge signed the execution order, ANC secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa sent a letter of appeal to the governor. Ramaphosa asked for &quot;compassionate reconsideration of the sentence ... and that (Jamal) be removed from death row and be allowed to appeal his sentence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu, in its letter to Ridge, said it was clear from reports it had received that the trial was &quot;fraught with bias and prejudice. We are therefore persuaded that his death sentence should be commuted and that the entire record of the trial should be reviewed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jamal, aka Wesley Cook, has been described as America's own Salman Rushdie. He was a prominent radio journalist and president of the Philadelphia chapter of the Association of Black Journalists. In the 1970s he was information &quot;minister&quot; for the Philadelphia chapter of the Black Panther Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since July 1982 he has been in solitary confinement on death row in Huntington, Pennsylvania after being convicted of killing a police officer on December 9 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The night of the shooting, he was driving his cab when he spotted his brother on the side of the road arguing with a policeman. He went to see what was happening, a melee ensued, and both Jamal and the officer were shot.  Jamal was also beaten by police. None of the witnesses could testify who had fired the first or the fatal shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout his trial, Jamal maintained his innocence. The 12-person jury that convicted him included 11 white men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1991, the US Supreme Court denied Jamal's petition for review of his conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While in jail Jamal has continued to write articles for a number of newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worldwide support for Jamal has come from a variety of individuals and organisations, among them Harry Belafonte and Whoopi Goldberg. Trade unions have been especially active in the campaign. Among the South African unions which have written to Governor Ridge are the National Union of Metalworkers and the Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers' Union.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 9, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jacques Magliolo reports on proposed changes to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange listings criteria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shareholders are set to obtain greater control of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) from next month. But the changes in disclosure and listing requirements fall short of statements made in a document circulated by the JSE in August last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A draft consultation document was sent out in August 1994 to companies, auditors and stockbrokers for comment. Alterations were expected to be announced in January 1995 relating to pyramid and shareholder structures, cash shells, powers of the JSE, creation of new sectors and greater transparency for company disclosure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the exchange took six months longer than planned -- in order to consult more widely -- it has backtracked on a number of moves that would have increased transparency and improved liquidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first is the minimum shareholder spread. At least 10 percent of a company's shares must now be in the hands of the general public. Companies will have to ensure this percentage remains in force at all times and existing companies will have until the year 2 000 to comply with this requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The August Draft Consultation document had this figure at 25 percent, which would have gone a long way towards dismantling conglomerate control of the South African financial market. This would also have increased the number of shares traded and thus improved liquidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of two-tiered pyramid structures is unresolved, which means that a listed holding company can only have one listed subsidiary. In turn, that holding company cannot have a major shareholder that is listed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Commentators on the constitution draft were split on the desirability of listing such structures and instruments. The JSE and the government will discuss the issue later this year and, in the interim, they will be listed,&quot; the exchange announced this week that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems pressure from business has forced the exchange to backtrack on minimum shareholder spread and call for talks with the government. Two examples highlight this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Black groups listed on the exchange in the past 12 months do not fulfil the 25 percent shareholder structure proposed in the initial draft document, but all encompass multi-tiered pyramids. These companies include the much publicised New Africa Investment Limited (Nail), Corporate Africa, Real Africa Holdings and Real Africa Investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Nail's pre-listing statement indicated that 25,6 percent of its shareholders were &quot;other black shareholders&quot;, it did not provide details as to whether these are individuals or organisations. During an interview earlier this year Nail chairman Dr Nthato Motlana warned the JSE not to tamper with pyramids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;We will oppose the JSE's forthcoming changes to regulations, particularly those affecting pyramid structures. Now that we are becoming more established in big business, the JSE and white conglomerates want to change the rules.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motlana's reasons for insisting that pyramid structures remain are logical. He asserts: &quot;Pyramids enable companies with small shareholder stakes to control larger companies. If this type of structure is abolished it will make it impossible for blacks to own companies or to help transfer wealth to disadvantaged people.&quot; As such, Nail's recent bid for the restructured JCI is highlighted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second example is the unexplained delay in Mondi Paper's listing.  In January this year the company was ready to list, but industry analysts say that the hesitation has been caused by the draft document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mondi does not need to list for financial reasons, but to improve its image,&quot; says an insider. &quot;A change in the shareholder structure means that Amic would have to sell a large stake in its subsidiary. I believe that Amic placed pressure on the exchange to reduce the 25 percent to 10 percent,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite these compromises, an important new direction for the JSE lies in its desire to strengthen company disclosure. Companies will be obliged to announce &quot;as soon as possible any information which is of a price- sensitive nature&quot;. This information will include details on possible takeovers, new contracts and even the discovery of new mineral resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two new sectors are to be formed, namely a &quot;redevelopment&quot; sector to help black companies list and a &quot;cash shell&quot; sector. There are at present three cash shells listed on the JSE, namely Barnetts, Bergers and The Pharmaceutical Wholesale Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On becoming a cash shell, a listed company will be transferred to the new sector. If the company fails to acquire viable assets within six months, its shares will be suspended. Finally, the stock exchange has changed listing requirements for the Venture Capital Market to make it more accessible to the general public. The requirement for subscribed capital has been reduced from R2-million to R500 000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 9, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Displaced South African Andrew Dosunmu -- fashion stylist and music video director -- is hot property in New York. He spoke to Tony Karon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andrew Dosunmu is pacing around his sparse studio apartment in Manhattan's fashion district, anxious for feedback on his directorial debut music video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no furniture beyond the functional -- a futon, a drawing board, a music system, a large television set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the TV, the wicked bass-and-wah-wah-guitar rhythm of the legendary Isaac Hayes' new single, Funky Junky, drives a moody montage of expressionist, monochrome images of African diaspora city life. The video is brilliant, and not surprisingly, it has opened a new dimension to Dosunmu's career.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before Funky Junky, he had only directed a couple of short films and commercials for Gitanes and Revlon. But his work as a fashion stylist has earned Dosunmu a reputation as one of the most exciting influences on New York's aesthetic landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born in England of exiled South African parents, Dosunmu grew up closer to London's rebellious Jamaican &quot;rude boys&quot; than his parents' exile milieu. After studying fashion at St Martin's College, he worked for six years in the Paris design studio of Yves St Laurent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Then I realised it wasn't clothes I liked. It was the overall image, the look, that attracted me to fashion,&quot; he explained. Which took him to New York to work as a freelance stylist. Within two years, his work has livened up the pages of magazines ranging from bibles of downtown cool like Paper and VIBE, to establishment fashion vehicles like Vogue, L'Uomo and Esquire. He styled the designs of his friend Antoine Xuly Bet for Robert Altman's film Pret-a-Porter (the &quot;subway&quot; show presented by Forrest Whittaker's character).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dosunmu uses unconventional settings for designer ranges -- the rugged slackness of the reggae dancehall, the menacing camaraderie of young street gangsters, the feisty elegance of Puerto Rican girls in the hood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, the New York Times included him among five young stylists turning fashion on its head, and throughout our interview his answering machine fields calls from fashion editors begging him to bring his signature to their pages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where once stylists simply finished off the edges of fashion shoots, today their ability to move between the worlds of couture, film and music videos has propelled them to centre stage in defining fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dosunmu and his contemporaries create the context for fashion by grounding it in street-culture and urban realities, lacing it with post-modern ironies and appreciating clothing as a vocabulary for identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Designers tend to design clothes, not the spirit in which they're worn,&quot; Dosunmu explains. &quot;It is up to the stylist to suggest that spirit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You're not just showing clothes; you're creating a feeling, an ambience which evokes a lifestyle. Stylists are responsible for the content of the spread -- putting the clothes together, and making sense of them. The stylist is really the creative director of a fashion shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;look&quot; of a music video is as important as its sound in relaying messages, and this puts stylists at the centre. As the visual principles of music videos began to dominate other media, stylists found themselves interlocutors between the worlds of music, fashion, the visual media and street culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today the fashion industry depends on them to interpret clothing for a media-savvy market. Which changes the rules of fashion: &quot;Anybody can be fashionable,&quot; says Dosunmu. &quot;You just have to have the money. But a lot of the people who have money and buy the clothes don't necessarily have style -- often they look ridiculous in them. Most people who's style I admire, when I ask them where they got their clothes, it's the shop next door or a thrift store. But they put it together so brilliantly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Style, he says, is about putting things together, about using clothes to communicate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dosunmu and his contemporaries often wrench clothes out of the elite couture context in which they were created, setting them on the streets, mixing them up with thrift store and no-name brand basics. (Dosunmu is as likely to use neighbourhood kids as professional models on his shoots).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His aesthetic is unmistakeably African: &quot;African people are not generally fashionable, but they're very stylish. That's a big influence in my life. As a teenager in England, I rejected the whole South Africa connection.  I wanted to be like everyone around me. But the fact that I'm African was there unconsciously, and it came out in my work without me realising it at first. Which means that I appreciate it much more ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A concern with styling is common throughout Africa. An underpaid worker living in a squatter camp in Kinshasa may wear an Armani suit (often showing the label) or pair of shoes or sunglasses. It's a way of constructing an identity, appearing to defy the limits on the individual's mobility. The deployment of styles can also have a playfully subversive component: in colonial and post-colonial Africa, there is a long tradition of the dominated appropriating the outward symbols of power in order to mock that power and render it hollow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I love that culture clash,&quot; Dosunmu enthuses. &quot;Think about what it means when you see a rugged African youth in a bowler hat. Or a guy in a traditional West African gown wearing mirror lens Ray Bans ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Style is used to construct identity throughout Africa and the African diaspora. In the US, for example, the Black Panther party carried guns to fight racism, but their dress codes revealed a deep awareness of the power of images: the Panthers' leather blazers and striped T-shirts, bandoliers and berets are an unmistakeable reference to the Hollywood representation of the French Resistance and other anti-Nazi partisans of World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, the fact that Sophiatown gangsters of the 1950s opted for Hollywood gangster styling reflects a symbolic defiance of white authority, by appropriating the styles of white society's nightmare figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a game that Dosunmu enjoys playing himself: &quot;I went to a wedding the other day, wearing a three-piece suit and tie -- I looked like something off Saville Row. It was a trip, teasing the powers that be, saying 'I could look like that too' ... And straight after, I went to a reggae dance, dressed like that. And all the boys were like 'whoa, gwaan rasta'. Knowing I could walk out of there and on the street some policeman would call me 'sir' because he would think I was some hotshot ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dosunmu's fascination with African aesthetics has taken him on travels throughout West Africa, and last November, he finally ventured 'home'. A shoot for VIBE magazine took him to Cape Town for two weeks, where he used township youths to model casuals and sportswear by top New York designers. &quot;I felt very at home in South Africa, and I've got to get back there to make a film,&quot; he enthuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although more music videos and films figure high on his agenda, styling is still his great love. &quot;I want to encourage people to take a new look at what's around them, and express themselves with their clothes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If stylists' power to evoke meanings with clothing derives from their ability to move between worlds, then Dosunmu's diaspora African experience (a dislocated South African in London, Paris and New York) has given him a unique vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think the reason people like my work is because I'm an ethnic, an outsider, and because of that I'm very aware of any ethnic culture, or other outsider cultures like gay and lesbian. I'm sensitive to outsider cultures, and today people are looking for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With that, he dons a furry homburg hat and pedals off through the fashion district on a bicycle of the type used by South African postmen during the 1960s. A bicycle which, in the vocab of style, could be translated as a wink.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 9, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Pat Sidley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week's march on Parliament by thousands of angry Christians highlights the rapid growth of fundamentalist Christian groups in South Africa, and mirrors the advance of the religious right wing in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The marchers had come to protest the exclusion of the words &quot;Almighty God&quot; from the Constitution. But their agenda reaches much further than this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several of the groups, which marched under the same banner and share the same concerns, have large memberships, including the KwaSizabantu ministers, who see themselves as a counter to the more liberal churches which signed the Rustenberg Declaration several years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the organisers of the march, Reverend Peter Hammond, says many of them have grave concerns, aside from the Constitution, such as the exclusion of Ascension Day from the public holidays, the proposed legalisation of abortion and the growth of the pornography industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group set up to represent those interests is called &quot;The Christian Voice&quot; and it raised tens of thousands of rands locally to fund the march, says its representative Reverend Soon Zevenster of the Evangelical Reform Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hammond and Zevenster told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the group was set up only a month ago with the express purpose of taking up these causes and the march was only a beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group hired the buses and trains used to ferry the poorer supporters of its cause from the surrounding townships and squatter camps, according to Zevenster, and printed close to 400 000 pamphlets advertising the march. Money was raised through individual congregations by asking ministers in churches to support the cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hammond's group, the Frontline Fellowship, co-operates with several other groups (with which it shares offices in Cape Town). These include United Christian Action, whose purpose it is, he explained, to carry out the political and social concerns among the &quot;silent majority&quot;. The chairman of United Christian Action is Ed Cain, who gained infamy some years ago when he was associated with the Christian League, a front group used by the previous government to counter the influence of the South African Council of Churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He must have been burned in that experience,&quot; maintained Hammond, who said Cain authored the organisation's constitution, which explicitly bars the acceptance of any government funding. Cain's daughter Mirian runs another associated group, African Christian Action, whose business it is to fight pornography, abortion, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Frontline Fellowship itself, according to Hammond, sends missionaries, bibles, medication and food into countries such as Sudan, Malawi and Mozambique and, to a lesser extent, Rwanda and KwaZulu/ Natal.  Hammond, with some of his missionaries, spent an uncomfortable week in prison in the hands of Frelimo troups in 1989, when they abducted him from Malawi and accused him of gun-running. He vigorously denies this, stating that he was released after a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Frontline Fellowship, he says, is funded by spontaneous donations from several sources, including local ones, and others in the United States and Europe. He does not, he says, raise funds, having biblical objections to the notion of fundraising. The money flows in spontaneously to do God's work, he explains, while being critical of the Christian Voice's fundraising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The size of the march, which caught even its organisers off guard, has struck a chord of worry among the leaders of the &quot;mainstream&quot; churches. Many of these leaders noticed with concern that the numbers of marchers must reflect the fact that some of their own members were among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Press Club in Cape Town this week, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu dealt with some of the complex issues raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are those Christians who claim that there are unambiguous and categorical directives regarding what the Christian position ought to be on issues such as abortion, homosexuality, divorce, euthanasia, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Such people are able to claim that 'the Bible says' and then believe that they have dealt once and for all with a complex issue and anyone who disagrees with them is really not Christian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He argued, too, that the inclusion of the words &quot;Almighty God&quot; in the last Constitution did not prevent abuses of power -- a point which Hammond acknowledges. But he points at previously Communist states which guaranteed in constitutions a right to religious freedom -- and failed to provide it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 9, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Draft legislation spelling out the powers of the Gender Equity Commission has been prepared by the Department of Justice, giving the body the same teeth as the Human Rights Commission to perform its tasks of ensuring gender equity in Parliament and society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Parliamentary Commission on Gender Equity met on Wednesday to grapple with the scope of its functions and powers. The commission, chaired by African National Congress (ANC) MP Ruth Mompati, was established by women parliamentarians who were concerned about the advancement of women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Party MP Shelia Camerer said a Commission on Gender Equity would be more effective than a Womens' Ministry as these had failed dismally across sub- Sarahan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A commission could be given power to introduce legislation and vet legislation from other ministries for gender sensitivity, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Ellen Kornegay, of the Womens' Development Foundation, who gave evidence before the commission, said what was needed was a dynamic and interactive relationship between national, provincial and local governments, and access to non-governmental organisations on women's issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Participation should not be limited to parliamentarians alone. We need to monitor gender compliance in both the public and private sector. The commission could then report annually to Parliament and society on the advancement of women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mompati said the Ministry of Justice had promised that draft legislation on the commission would be completed within the next week and would serve as a working document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said that while the commission would have to consult widely on the draft Bill, it should be mindful that the deadline was approaching for the draft legislation to be submitted to the Cabinet so that it can be dealt with in Parliament this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 9, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speculation is rife that Sol Kerzner is involved in South Africa's first satellite TV channel, reports Justin Pearce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa entered the satellite television era on Wednesday evening when Africa Satellite Entertainment Corporation (ASEC) launched its sports and entertainment channel amid speculation that casino king Sol Kerzner is involved in the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move is an embarrassment for the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) which intends to regulate satellite broadcasting but which still has no means of doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ASEC's programme was beamed from Swaziland via the Intelsat 704 satellite from 7pm to 11pm and will be broadcast daily.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The station is due to be launched officially in September with a full line-up of entertainment programmes. ASEC is currently broadcasting on 10,974GHz with sound on 6,68MHz. The ku-band (small dish) signal is unencoded and, for the time being, free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wednesday's launch makes ASEC the first satellite broadcaster to get on the air in South Africa, several months ahead of rival MultiChoice, which will be broadcasting in association with M-Net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controlling interests behind ASEC are being kept under wraps, but there is speculation that Sol Kerzner's Sun International is among the backers of the new broadcaster. Although a Sun International representative could neither confirm nor deny the speculation, observers commented that the sports footage aired during the test broadcast showed an overwhelming bias towards events at Sun International venues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ASEC, which initially intended being on the air before the beginning of June, delayed its first test broadcast pending an IBA ruling . Managing director Mark Grey said that the company had no intention of becoming a pirate broadcaster. However, this week the IBA appeared flummoxed by ASEC's appearance on the air. IBA head of licensing Jac van der Merwe said the IBA councillors had discussed satellite broadcasting but had not yet reached a conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't know how we are going to deal with this issue,&quot; Van der Merwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that in terms of International Telecommunications Union norms, the IBA could tolerate signal spill-over from a satellite aimed at a neighbouring country. However, if the signal were aimed at South Africa -- as is the case with ASEC -- the IBA would have to intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ASEC has got in ahead of the field by using Intelsat 704 which was already in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the launch of the PAS-4 satellite which is to be used by MultiChoice has been put in jeopardy by a rocket which could well be described as the Francois Pienaar of the skies -- it is injury-prone. The Ariane rocket, which is due to put PAS-4 in the sky later this year, has suffered no fewer than six failed launches in the past 18 months. In January this year Ariane killed five people after crashing in China shortly after a launch, and previously at least two satellites had been destroyed by malfunctions in the rocket.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 9, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alfred Nzo's ministry stands accused of not having made the leap into the new South Africa, reports Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister Alfred Nzo and his Department of Foreign Affairs came in for a barrage of criticism this week from the ANC alliance and academics who charged that it had failed to provide the moral leadership the world expected from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said the department's record over the past year showed it was one of the least effective and least transparent departments in government today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The critical focus on foreign affairs took place at a parliamentary workshop in Cape Town at the weekend and at a symposium on Monday organised by the Centre for Southern African Studies and the International Labour Resource and Information Group (Ilrig).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Monday's symposium, Cosatu spokesperson Neil Coleman said the department did not provide the moral leadership on the international stage the world expected from South Africa and, particularly, Nelson Mandela.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;South Africa can play a leading role in challenging global apartheid and the policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs should be geared towards doing so. But we have yet to see such policies emanating from the department,&quot; Coleman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University of Durban Westville political studies head John Daniels said almost 90 percent of Foreign Affairs ministry staff, including Director General Rusty Evans, have been retained by Nzo, and ANC members trained abroad in foreign affairs before the elections found the doors to the department shut firmly in their faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The management of the department lacks expertise and new blood.  Foreign policy is made by a small elite and a group of bureaucrats who are determined to maintain the shroud of secrecy in the department,&quot; Daniels said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only response we get to our barrage of criticism is a promise to establish an advisory council. But if there is no desire to receive advice, what is the use of such a structure?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Althea Macquene of Ilrig said Foreign Affairs was the &quot;most opaque&quot; department in government. &quot;It has not yet published a white paper, nor has it made known the process it will adopt to do so or set a timetable for its completion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of controversial foreign policy decisions taken recently remain unexplained -- Mandela's relationship with the Indonesian and Sudanese governments, South Africa's stand on the review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and its refusal to support a United States resolution at the United Nations to investigate human rights violations in Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Assembly Select Committee chairman Raymond Suttner said he could only conclude from articles in the press that the relationship with Indonesia stems from the fact that its president made financial donations to the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Does the Department of Foreign Affairs not have a duty to explain to the public why this situation exists, particularly in the light of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor?&quot; Suttner asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;South Africa's vote at the UN on the Cuban issue was seen in some quarters as very controversial. Yet immediately after the vote, the South African representative to the UN was unable to explain to the media why we took that stand. The department has yet to give an explanation of its vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suttner said there was little information about where most foreign policy originates in the government. Decision making in the department has not changed substantially under an ANC government and the problem is compounded by the fact that the president, Vice- President Thabo Mbeki and other ministries, particularly Trade and Industry, Home Affairs and Health, regularly make decisions with foreign policy implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said foreign policy should not be the exclusive preserve of professional diplomats and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but should involve Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to remember that whatever is done by the minister or the Department of Foreign Affairs is done in the name of South Africa and the public. We need to move away from a situation which presumes that because foreign affairs has a special area of concern it can be exempted from the same degree of public scrutiny that applies to defence or security or home affairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suttner said the presidency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs left little room for the public or Parliament to make an input on its decisions.  However, a significant step in this direction was made when the department's budget was reviewed by the select committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee agreed on the overall goals of the department, but criticised the allocation of funds to South Africa's missions when the budget proposed spending only R105-million of the allocated R645- million on African missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the ministry was providing a &quot;fair number&quot; of briefings to the committee, these were generally at the request of the committee and related to international crises or controversies. There was never a briefing prior to an important decision or visit, and there is no mechanism for briefings to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The failure to talk to one another before important decisions makes it harder to have good relations. It impedes the type of common reflection that is needed to move away from ad hoc approaches to foreign relations,&quot; Suttner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Foreign Affairs should be sufficiently transparent to enable meaningful parliamentary and public scrutiny and debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He called for a &quot;rupture&quot; with the past in the Department of Foreign Affairs, especially with regard to its policy process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Now that we have a democratic government, we are entitled to expect democratic foreign policy which is accountable to the people of South Africa and driven by them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 9, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It took three days of court argument, three-and-a-half months of deliberation and 244 pages of opinion for the Constitutional Court to re-establish the sanctity of life in South Africa by declaring invalid the death penalty. This week's decision is a major break from the past. It brings to an end South Africa's long-standing dominance of the international capital punishment market. And it is the first time in this country that new institutions have given the rights of individuals ascendancy over the force of public opinion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who argue that the 11 judges are over-riding public opinion, or that a matter of this sort should be settled by referendum, miss the point of a Bill of Rights and a Constitutional Court. The function of these new institutions is to give individuals and minorities protection from the shifting winds of public opinion. The public may come to believe that the killers of Chris Hani should be beheaded in public, or those perpetuating violence in KwaZulu/Natal be locked up without trial, or that abortionists should be jailed. But a Bill of Rights is intended to assert that some rights are so fundamental to democracy that they are inviolable. It is intended to ensure that individuals and minorities are protected from the vagaries of public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hopefully we have a government strong enough not to feel the need to pander to public opinion on this. One would expect the National Party to latch on to this populist cause, as it has, forgetting quickly that it found itself unable to hang anyone in the last few years of its government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is worth noting that there was an outcry when President Nelson Mandela said he would ask for changes in the Constitution if it was necessary to prevent violence in KwaZulu/Natal. No such outcry has accompanied the National Party request to change the Constitution to allow the state to kill people. But if you water down the right to life in the Bill of Rights, you will be giving up the most basic, the most important, the most fundamental right of all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There could be an argument for this if there were substantial evidence that the death penalty was an effective deterrent to crime; or that one could eliminate the possibilities of errors which sometimes take the wrong person to the gallows; or remove the likelihood that some defendants -- those without access to proper defence -- would be more likely to be hanged than others. But none of these over-ride the most basic argument against capital punishment: that this country, more than most, needs to re-establish the sanctity of human life, not continue to degrade it. You cannot do this by giving the state the right to kill.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 2, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Paul Martin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cannes -- This is a glamorous place, and glamour is not something that sits easily with Nadine Gordimer's self-image. She was wary of a request for a photograph of her on her top-floor Hotel Majestic balcony overlooking the azure Mediterranean, though she did allow two. &quot;People back home may get the wrong impression,&quot; she worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The right impression, folks, is as follows: Gordimer worked very hard indeed, judging 23 films in her capacity as vice- president of the jury, and no, she was not swanning about with superstars. &quot;It's a pity that we're not able to meet the great actors and directors. But it would be wrong to be seen in their company if we're judging their films,&quot; she properly pointed out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To her credit, Gordimer has never been particularly interested in gratuitous socialising -- last year, for instance, she declined an invitation to tea, just before Nelson Mandela's inauguration as president, with the wife of the United Nations secretary general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, despite her formidable work ethic, one got the distinct impression that she was actually rather enjoying it all. She found the members of the jury stimulating. &quot;People may have expected me to clash somewhat on the jury with (Serial Mom director) John Waters, but we got on tremendously well,&quot; she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're very different personalities, yet we have one thing in common: we like to push right to the edge ... even if our edges are different,&quot; she somewhat opaquely expanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just what, I ventured to ask, qualified Gordimer, with her Nobel Prize for Literature, to be an arbiter of films? She bristled slightly. &quot;It's the writing of the screenplay that really sets apart the great films from the good,&quot; she stated. &quot;In fact, my jury colleagues believe that most films are getting better and better visually, so the dialogue is really the distinguishing feature. That's where I come in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any case, Gordimer is no stranger to the movie world: she wrote the screenplays for three of the seven short films of her works that were made on shoestring budgets in the late 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury's preferences were, at the time we spoke, top- secret. But it wasn't hard to tell from her approach that the winning film -- Yugoslav director Emir Kustorica's Underground -- met her criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I want a film, just like any good book, to be set in a social and political milieu. If the human and the political aspects are not related, then the film is a failure. How can a story be devoid of politics? Where would it take place -- in the clouds? In the end, stories without depth are forgotten.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kustorica's setting of his film in war-torn Yugoslavia mirrors Gordimer's own themes, perhaps having some resonance with her Six Feet in the Country. This was made into a low-budget film, which the late Chris Davis brought to Cannes many years back ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African products, despite the huge political upheaval, she lamented, were noticeably absent -- apart from Souleymane Cisse's outdated and crass Waati, about which Gordimer wisely declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm not privy to whether other South African films were submitted but didn't make it to the last 23,&quot; she said. &quot;But I've been actively promoting South Africa's film industry.&quot; She had, for example, alerted a top Indian producer to the wealth of themes about the South African &quot;Asian&quot; communities, reflected in works already extant in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many international filmmakers are seeing South Africa as just a place to make their motion pictures. But what they don't realise is that they don't need to bring their own crews and their own actors to South Africa. We have superb black actors, good enough technicians, such talent. And good writers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It &quot;deeply disturbs me&quot;, the Nobel Prizewinner commented, &quot;when black Americans play the roles of black South Africans&quot;. She would be outraged should an American be cast in the role of Nelson Mandela in any film of his life. Gordimer believes there is a plethora of wonderful material for future South African films (and books). &quot;People's experiences in the new South African realities, facing up to changes personally and politically -- that really is the subject matter we will be tackling,&quot; she asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of her books, she would be most keen for The Conservationist to be made into a feature film. In the story, she pointed out, a black man buried by a white farmer is unearthed after a flash-flood. &quot;It's my most lyrical, and perhaps my most difficult work,&quot; she mused. &quot;It'll need somebody very special to do it. The central issue in South Africa is the land, and this book deals with who owns what.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will South Africa's Nobel laureate incorporate the Cannes experience into her future work in print or on celluloid? On that, as the cliche goes, the jury is still out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 2, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Reg Rumney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the world waits for South Africa to spell out its privatisation plans, next door, Mozambique has thundered ahead with a far-reaching privatisation programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the end of February this year, Mozambique's government had privatised 21 large, strategic enterprises, and plans to privatise a further 40 or so over the next two years, said World Bank resident representative Simon Bell at a regional press seminar in Windhoek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the end of 1996, says Bell, most industrial sector activity would be in private hands. &quot;The process is now accelerating with the sale of the cement plants to Portuguese interests, the cashew nut processing plants to Mozambican and other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interests, and the sale of soft drink plants.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sale of the breweries, additional cashew nut plants, coastal shipping operations, and plastics factories is being negotiated with serious bidders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The irony is all the more obvious against the strongly socialist stance of the Frelimo government in the past. To be sure, South Africa did not nationalise to anything like the extent that Mozambique did after its independence, and so there is not as much to privatise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the main concerns of the World Bank, said Bell, was the dramatic decline over the past seven years in the relatively well-diversified and dynamic industrial sector Mozambique had at independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the agricultural front, as part of what could be construed as a kind of recolonisation, Anglo American is coming back to work its old cashew nut processing plant at Xai Xai, though Mozambican investors have put money in as well. Mozambique now produces 10 percent of the cashews it did at its peak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International investors were also involved in cotton, Bell revealed, with Lonrho in a joint venture operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently there have been moves to privatise some of the large sugar, copra and tea estates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fisheries were among the first to be privatised and sold to, among others, Mozambican, Spanish, Portuguese and South African interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In transport, feasibility studies are underway for a toll road from Komatipoort to Maputo, and similar private sector initiatives may be possible through the Beira corridor. There could also soon be private sector involvement in the national airline, LAM, and there is already involvement in Maputo port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Along with financial sector reform which allows new banks to be licensed in Mozambique, the government recently announced that Mozambique's two state banks, which account for about 70 percent of total banking system assets, would be privatised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investment is not confined to privatisation: Fortune 500 company Enron is involved in a $30-million Pande gas field study. If the project, in which the World Bank is playing a catalyst role, comes off it will be a big foreign exchange boost, bringing in $200-million a year for a $400-million to $600-million investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is no surprise that much of the private sector investment comes from outside, specifically South Africa and ex-colonial master Portugal.  Mozambique is the world's poorest country, with a 1993 national income per head of $80. It is also one of the world's most aid-dependent countries, with aid pledges made in March of $800-million constituting a big chunk of the country's gross domestic product of $100-million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 2, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Paul Dixon and Nicola Gain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign investment is on the increase. While falling short of pre-election hype, the tide is changing, with inward investment is gaining strong momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United States firms have taken the lead -- not surprising since they disinvested heavily during the 1980s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Current activity may only be the tip of the iceberg, as it is expected that up to 50 percent of total foreign investment will ultimately come from the US. This represents a radical turnaround from the present position, where British companies account for around 50 percent of foreign investment -- estimated at R50-billion in stock and assets, with interests in about 1 500 companies,according to the Southern African Economic Research Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One huge potential source for investment is expected to be corporations forced to disinvest during the sanctions era when $25-billion in foreign investment was withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite these developments and the many promises of further investment, potential investors do face barriers which require urgent attention. The list of deterrents has only shrunk slightly despite the euphoria surrounding the elections and installation of the Government of National Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prioritising the list of concerns repeatedly raised by foreigners, while crucial, is as yet unresolved. If something is not done timeously, it is likely to result in many lost foreign investment opportunities. The key concerns raised are: high levels of crime and political instability; high corporate taxes and limited incentives to foreign investors; exchange control; adverse labour relations and low productivity; and low economic growth and a depreciating rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The flip-side portrays a number of attractions, especially when seen in the context of other emerging countries. These include: a sophisticated infrastructure; a local market of 40-million people, with growth forecast in consumer and aspiration spending; a &quot;stepping stone&quot; into Africa; the Reconstruction and Development Programme; a privatisation drive; conservative fiscal and monetary policies; and no ownership restrictions on foreign companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of US companies doing business in South Africa has risen by more than 300 over the past three years, of which 150 have invested funds in the country. The US-based Calvert Group, which looks at socially responsible investment, says that the number of US companies with employees or investments in South Africa has risen almost 20 percent since 1993, but adds that this still compares poorly with non-US firms currently in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) is committed to spending $85-million in 1995 alone, to finance US investments in South Africa. OPIC has also established two funds totalling $150-million for joint ventures and new investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign investment means that some of South Africa's more &quot;sleepy&quot; business sectors are in for a shake-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign investment will come, and only those companies pro- actively seeking joint venture opportunities and strategic alliances are likely to entrench their position in the new South African market as it becomes internationally interactive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 2, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 'black empowerment purchase' of JCI and Johnnic has important implications, reports Reg Rumney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Empowerment Consortium (NEC) is poised to buy a big stake in Johnnic, the industrial firm that came out of the unbundling of conglomerate Johannesburg Consolidated Investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The details of how the union and black-business-based consortium intends pulling this off are unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairman of the NEC, Metal &amp; Electrical Workers Union (Mawusa) secretary general Tommy Oliphant, indicates this is only the first step. A stake in the mining house JCI Ltd, the second of the three companies left after the dismemberment, is next. Some members of the consortium believe NEC should have a small stake in JCI Ltd, say 10 percent, as well as a larger one in Johnnic. Oliphant says a meeting with Anglo American to discuss details is imminent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Corporate Africa's Nthato Motlana, initially lukewarm, is now interested in coming along to buy into Johnnic. The other recent black empowerment exercise Real Africa Investments Limited (RAIL) has also been linked to the consortium, but Oliphant says RAIL, headed by Don Ncube, is only interested in the mining company, JCI Ltd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The union groupings involved, according to Oliphant are: Mawusa, the National Union of Mineworkers, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, the Food and Allied Workers Union, the South African Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union, and the South African Railways and Harbour Workers Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Along with them are various black business interests, including both arms of organised black business, the Federation of Business and Consumer Organisations, and the National African Federated Chambers of Commerce.  Several prominent black figures have been linked to the NEC, including businessman Don Mkwhanazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Board of Executors, locally, and Lehman Brothers, internationally, are advising the consortium. They will mobilise funds overseas and from South African business to buy into Johnnic, says Oliphant. Locally, the unions will approach pension and provident funds to direct investment towards the consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oliphant says the details of the financing have not been worked out.  One source maintains the NEC will not use debt, either local or foreign to acquire equity. This would make little sense, anyway, since servicing the debt at present interest rates could cancel out the monetary gains of buying into the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Oliphant says that from the union point of view, the consortium would not want the full 48 percent on offer for control of Johnnic, he mentions a figure of 34,5 percent. That kind of stake is effective control, as Anglo American Corporation's Brian St John points out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That size stake would not come cheap -- around R2-billion at the present value the market places on company's shares of R5,8-billion. And the 10 percent stake in JCI Ltd Oliphant mentions alone would cost R400-million, based on its present market capitalisation of around R4-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet investment without control makes no sense, since the NEC might as well buy into the underlying listed assets, such as South African Breweries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglo has made it clear there will be no special deals: it wants a market price for its shares. Indeed, St John points out that buying a controlling stake usually means paying a premium for the shares. Johnnic is now trading at an 18 percent discount to asset value, giving an indication of how much higher the price might have to rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oliphant also points to differences in the way the NEC sees black empowerment. On the one hand, he says the reason for not wanting control is not to create a conflict of interests. &quot;We don't want the unions toyi-toying at us.&quot; On the other hand, he believes the NEC can have an influence on how the companies which are bought are run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have succeeded in doing that through the Community Growth Fund,&quot; says Oliphant, who has been intimately involved in the union-led unit trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oliphant says the exercise will empower black business, but the unions do not want to create instant millionaires, as was done with the listing of Motlana's New Africa Investments and Ncube's RAIL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Empowerment should be spread, he says, and new conglomerates should not be created to replace the old ones being dismantled, with black conglomerates dominated by certain people. &quot;We don't want just to reverse the roles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would rule out the kind of pyramid structure whereby Motlana rules New Africa Investments. It also means the NEC will have to find a good deal of hard cash to buy control.Understandably, speculation about the deal is rife. One source maintains that borrowings would not be used, and that Motlana will mobilise funds from Sanlam, which aided his move into insurer Metropolitan Life, to help him buy into Johnnic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is bound to make Liberty Life nervous. Johnnic's biggest asset is South African Breweries (SAB), a conglomerate in its own right. Although Johnnic has only 13,8 percent of SAB, it accounts for around 60 percent of Johnnic, with Premier, Omnicor, Toyota and various property interests making up the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Liberty Life board must be wondering whether the deal is a cheap way into SAB, Toyota and Omnicor for Sanlam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnnic and Liberty have a joint control agreement on Bevcon, the holding company of SAB, and Premier, but St John points out it only kicks in if Johnnic decides to sell. The agreement, in simple terms, means that either group has a pre-emptive right on the other's shares. But there is no &quot;grandfather&quot; clause, so the agreement stays with Johnnic, whoever buys controls of it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 2, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The upcoming season of labour protests will make or break the labour movement, argues Eddie Koch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Do or die. That's how a union shopsteward this week explained The Congress of South African Trade Unions' decision to stage a 1980s-style programme of mass action around the Labour Relations Amendment Bill. Although unintended, his statement may just portend the fate of organised labour after the protests in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu last week announced it would mobilise its members in a campaign of rolling mass action, including lunch-time work stoppages and marches, that will culminate in a national day of protest on June 19 to back its demands around the new labour laws.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Central to the dramatic decision -- which could lead to the biggest display of popular militancy since last year's elections -- is a determination by the unions to ensure that industry-wide collective bargaining is made compulsory in the country's new labour relations law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parties are divided about why this breakdown in what appeared be a honeymoon spirit of cooperation and tripartism occurred so suddenly.  Employers say it is a sign of weakness and desperation on the part of labour.  Unionists insist it reflects a growing confidence and grassroots militancy in their ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Either way, now that a de facto deadlock has occurred in talks over the Bill, which have been taking place in the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac), the labour movement stands at the crossroads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the unions' collective muscle is strong enough, they will stamp their mark on a law that will shape industrial relations for the next few decades. If the mass action fizzles, they will lose the fight for the heart of the vital Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the employers' team that has been bargaining with organised labour over the Bill say the move reflects a strategic decision by Cosatu to secure its rights by statute rather than by on-the-ground organisational strength in the factories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The unions here see labour movements around the world in decline or under attack. Their action -- together with other demands like those for a closed shop or mandatory workers' representation on company boards -- reflects a deep concern about union security in a period of declining organisational strength,&quot; says one commentator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu representative Neil Coleman rejects the &quot;brinksmanship theory&quot; that dominates management explanations of Cosatu's strategy. &quot;We are undertaking this action now simply because business is not taking the negotiations over the Bill seriously,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Despite a number of meetings over our demands, business has repeatedly refused to come back to the table with fresh mandates from their constituency to negotiate in a flexible way and move forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coleman says his national executive committee's decision to embark on mass action followed, and reflected, popular militancy among rank-and-file members over an issue that &quot;will shape labour relations in the country for the next 40 years&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proof of this, he says, is that a rash of strikes and protests over employers' reluctance to accept industry- wide collective bargaining during annual wage negotiations had broken out in the chemical, retail and textile sectors well before the executive meeting last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our assistant general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi attended a regional shopstewards council on the Witwatersrand that was attended by about 1 200 shopstewards a week ago. He came back shocked and said he had never seen such a militant mood among our members&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coleman acknowledges that the unions' bargaining power over the bill will be weakened if the collective muscle fails. &quot;But the history of Cosatu shows that single issue campaigns have captured the imagination of our members, particularly around burning issues. And make no mistake, this is a burning issue for our members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are other reasons that explain the timing of Cosatu's strategy.  Most importantly, the labour federation clearly hopes that &quot;the state&quot; -- the labour ministry, cabinet and a parliament made up of numerous former union activists -- will lean in their favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This expectation is strengthened by the fact that the African National Congress cannot afford to alienate its strongest ally during the run-up to local government elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another factor that may tilt the balance of forces in favour of the unions is the government's need for a stable system of labour relations in order to encourage foreign investment and economic growth. Labour Minister Tito Mboweni said as much this week when he insisted that the two parties meet the June deadline for agreement on a draft Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Coleman: &quot;If the mass action fails, the workers' grievances will simply resurface later. There will be continued skirmishing and these issues will continue to raise their heads until they are resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mboweni needs a new Bill in place and has gone on record as saying the old apartheid law is not in line with the new political situation. So although we are directing our demands at business, there is an element of challenge to the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the time being, however, employers have battened down the hatches and are hoping that countervailing forces will take the wind out of union strength in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is patently nonsense to say we are stalling in the negotiation because it suits us to have the old Labour Relations Act instead of the new law,&quot; says Adrian du Plessis, senior member of the employer delegation at Nedlac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We unreservedly support most of the proposals in the current draft of the Bill including the clauses which allow for central bargaining on a voluntary basis. It is the unions which are introducing new demands and holding up the process ... We are firm on rejecting their demands for compulsory centralised bargaining.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tough stand by business will receive some encouragement from the stance adopted this week by Godfrey Oliphant, chairman of parliament's standing committee on labour.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Cosatu's assumption that ANC and fomer Cosatu MPs would support the union's demands &quot;might be a reasonable assumption&quot; but was &quot;not necessarily a given one balanced against national interests&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oliphant, himself a former vice president of Cosatu, said union members were justified in believing that it now had reliable allies in the state but that the unions' case would ultimately be judged in parliament after being weighed against the country's best interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stayaways, general strikes and national days of protest in South Africa are notoriously labile and their outcome difficult to predict. More clear is that next month's season of mass action -- whatever its outcome -- will mark a watershed in the history of the country's labour movement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Olu Sarr, PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Organisation of African Unity Summit in Addis Ababa attracted most comment in the African press this week. The assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak drew most discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the drama, the semi-official Dakar newspaper Le Soleil said that the event highlighted the inefficiency of Ethiopian security because the attackers, &quot;who certainly came from abroad, managed to prepare their plot calmy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This security lapse, it added, would only give more ammunition to those people who want the OAU headquarters moved to another capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government-owned Times of Zambia advised Egypt to find a peaceful solution to the grievances of its Islamic militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is our view that the present hardline approach against the fanatics will not ensure peace,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While not blaming the militants directly for the attack on Mubarak it termed the incident as &quot;extremely alarming&quot;, noting Mubarak's importance on the African and Arab political stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other government-owned paper, the Zambia Daily Mail, ridiculed what it termed &quot;Africa's enemies who had tried to derail the summit&quot; by trying to kill Mubarak in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it said, the act only served to further unite Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It, however, hailed the summit as success. Unlike previous gatherings, it said, the summit had not ended as a mere &quot;talking-shop&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said: &quot;Not only did the OAU look at the possibility of an intervention force&quot; but Secretary-General Salim Salim decided that the body &quot;needed teeth to bite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paper was referring to the ostracisation of defaulting members and those at war with each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For how can Africa explain that it goes to donors with a begging bowl in hand seeking money for development when most of it is used on war,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zairian News Agency, AZAP, said that the summit was conspicuous by the absence of several leaders among them presidents Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Ethiopian Herald said that despite its battered image the organisation had not failed in all undertakings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The OAU has just successfully completed the first phase of its struggle: decolonisation,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It continued: &quot;The OAU has now embarked upon the second phase of its struggle: the struggle to overcome the ever deepening socio-economic crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It concluded: &quot;There is definitely a long way to go for Africa to achieve its set goals but there has to be a reaffirmation of commitment on the part of OAU members to match words with deeds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other papers could not have agreed more with the latter part of that sentence. Most were clearly disappointed by the organisation's record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ouagadougou's (Burkina Faso) satirical Journal du Jeudi was openly hostile. It said the summit produced &quot;nothing new&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africans have come to the conclusion that their meetings by their leaders amount to nothing more that paper tigers,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the poor turnouts at many summits, it went on, African leaders all make a point of attending meetings called by their former colonial powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The entire organisation needs to be reorganised, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It serves no purpose to denouce countries in arrears of contributions if they are not made aware of the fact that their contributions are essential to the smooth functioning of the organisation,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another Ougadoudgou paper, Le Pays, termed the organisation an African illusion. It said it found it odd that the leaders meeting in Addis Ababa seemed more concerned with the meeting of the Council of Europe in Cannes than their own summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala's media urged the OAU to find a new role for itself now that decolonisation has ended. It called for renewed commitment to the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Part of the problem is that member countries do not believe in the OAU instruments and protocols they sign because it doesn't seem to make any difference whether they flout or follow the principles on which the organisation is founded,&quot; The Monitor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It advised the organisation to devise &quot;innovative approaches&quot; to issues confronting Africa rather than take the back seat and let the UN and other international agencies run the whole show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When the stakes are raised and the organisation ceases to be a free-for-all where no minimum acceptable standards of behaviour govern membership, African states will begin to value their places in the OAU,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala's New Vision commented on Nigeria where former president Olusegun Obasanjo and retired general Shehu Yar' Adua have been detained for alleged participation in a coup attempt in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As things stand, the impression to outsiders is that (Moshood) Abiola and Abasanjo are in jail not because they committed any offence but merely because they are an embarrassment to an undemocratic government,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the meantime, Nigeria should seriously consider setting up a broad-based government that would incorporate all parts of the country and all tendencies,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Military politics is not working and multi-party politics also has a poor track record in Nigeria. It is time for a change. Nigeria urgently needs a fresh democratic initiative if it is to retain its standing as the leading nation in sub-Saharan Africa,&quot; it concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Libyan papers were unanimous Monday in prasing Africa's support for Libya's seat at the United Nations Security Council, despite attempts by the West to block it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Al-Chams said Africa's support was a demonstration that the continent was on the right path to consolidating its independence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Paul Fauvet, PANA Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maputo, Mozambique (PANA) - The Mozambican post office introduced postal codes for the first time Friday into the country's mail address system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From now, letters and parcels should bear a five figure postal code immediately after the town or locality to which they are addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first figure indicates the province, the next two the city or district, and the final two the locality. Consulting a booklet printed by the post office gives users the correct postal code: thus should anyone wish to send a letter to Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama at his former bush headquarters in Central Mozambique, they will find that the correct address now is &quot;Maringue 37100&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first envelope bearing one of the new postal codes was posted Friday at Maputo central station by the Chairman of The Post Office Management Board, Pedro Murrima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the intention of the codes was to speed up the sorting and distribution of correspondence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The fundamental goal is speed and security,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The codes should avoid confusion caused by the fact that various localities bear the same, or very similar, names but are located in different parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The post office believes that the postal codes will be particularly useful when mechanised sorting is eventually introduced (currently all sorting is manual).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Envelopes bearing five black-lined squares for the five numbers of the postal codes are being distributed to post offices all over the country for distribution to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The postal service does not cover the entire country. Statistics available today to the Mozambican News Agency, AIM, show that there are 94 principal post offices, five major sorting centres and 45 secondary ones, and 103 rural post offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A further 186 post offices were closed during the war of destabilisation supported by South Africa's apartheid government but the management plans gradually to re-open them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees needs $44 million for the voluntary repatriation of some 300,000 Angolan refugees over the next 30 months, the organization said in a statement to PANA from its Geneval headquarters Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are 200,000 Angolan refugees in Zaire, 96,000 in Zambia, 12,000 in Congo and 1,000 in Namibia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also some 15,000 Angolan refugees are in 32 other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 5,500 of the refugees have returned to Angola on their own since the signing of a peace accord between the government and Unita in November.  The accord ended 20 years of civil war that left an estimated 600,000 people dead and 3 million others displaced internally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The continuing spontaneous returns make it essential that livelihood and integration projects be started inside Angola now,&quot; the UNHCR said in a financial appeal to donors Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A programme to make Angolans better aware of the dangers of an estimated 10 million land mines scattered across the country is also being undertaken in the refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNHCR expects to begin voluntary repatriation convoys by the middle of next year after the harvest season in the main asylum countries.  Some 83,000 refugees are likely to join the convoys, the organization said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lusaka meeting will identify issues of concern to women in the sub-region they believe are not been adequately addressed in the current document.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Kebby Musokotwane, the man who has just lost the presidency of the main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) to former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda, claimed on Thursday that the elections in which he was soundly drubbed were a &quot;sham&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda polled a massive 1,916 votes to Musokotwane's paltry 400 votes in party elections held at the University of Zambia main campus in Lusaka on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ex-Zambian president was a clear victor even before the balloting started: the incumbent had failed to raise 10 supporters from each of Zambia's nine provinces among the delegates to the congress to back his nomination for the post of president as required by the party constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda, who was the challenger, had to instruct seven provincial leaders to raise 10 people each for Musokotwane to enable the latter to contest. He had managed to raise supporters only from his home Southern Province, and Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Musokotwane, speaking at a press conference in Lusaka said however, that although the elections were a &quot;sham&quot; he would not petition the results &quot;in the interest of the party&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He accused Kaunda of using underhand methods to win the elections and regain the party presidency he had relinquished in 1992 after suffering a crushing defeat to President Frederick Chiluba and his movement for multi-party democracy (mmd) in Zambia's 1991 general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Musokotwane said the elections had been rigged by Kaunda whom he claimed was power hungry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The Mozambican Women's Forum is taking the government to task saying women's issues should be the concern of the State and not just the responsibility of one Ministry or Institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No one institution on its own could be expected to deal with the whole range of problems facing Mozambican women,&quot; warned the Forum's Chairperson, Isabel Casimiro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was speaking in Maputo Wednesday at the second national preparatory meeting for the United Nations World Conference on Women scheduled for China in September.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Casimiro also said a gender perspective be incorporated into the analysis and definition of national development policies and strategies, as a matter of urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum, an umbrella group linking various organisations involved in women's issues, regretted that there had been no significant progress in solving problems that were identified at the first preparatory meeting, held last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In particular, said Casimiro, the government had still not drafted a long-awaited bill that would revise and update family law. It also has not taken any measures to repeal laws that discriminate against women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The women accused the courts of lengthy delays in solving family disputes that come before them. This means that women complainants were kept waiting for months before the courts took decisions on their cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mozambican government pledged at the United Nations Summit On Social Development in Denmark, in March, that it would work to eliminate poverty, and create jobs. The Forum now wants Maputo to fulfil the pledge and help solve some of the problems of Mozambican women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Summit, World Leaders agreed that there could be no social development without the participation of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the government does not honour this promise&quot;, Ccasimiro warned, &quot;there was no way the country could escape from its chronic poverty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Official statistics indicate that between 60 and 70 per cent of the rural population, and 50 per cent of urban households are living in a state of absolute poverty. Mozambique's current population is estimated at 17 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-day meeting is debating the government's &quot;Draft Platform Of Action For Women's Progress Up To The Year 2000&quot;, plus an annex based on the current situation of women derived from countrywide field studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final document of the meeting will be included in the report which officials will present at the Beijing Conference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Ghana will host the July summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) should Nigeria decline, Finance Minister Kwesi Botchwey said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Signals we have received from official Nigerian sources indicate that Abuja is not willing to foot the entire summit bill,&quot; he said in Accra, the Ghanaian capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana, which holds the chairmanship should automatically host the summit but asked Nigeria to do so citing limited hotel facilities and financial difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is important to maintain the integrity of the organisation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botchwey was speaking to reporters after he had accompanied ECOWAS Executive-Secretary Edouard Benjamin for talks with President Jerry Rawlings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benjamin, a Guinean, briefed Rawlings on preparations the secretariat was making for the event and its financial standing. Benjamin said members of the 16-nation community owed the secretariat about 40 million U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citing a similar backlog on contributions, the larger continental body, the Organisation of African unity threatened sanctions on debtors and was able by this week, during its annual summit, to recover close to half the arrears due.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - The Sudanese Ministry of the Interior Wednesday said Egyptian troops attacked three police stations near the disputed area of Halayeb, killing two Policemen and wounding seven others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement issued by the Ministry in Khartoum said large numbers of Egyptian troops Tuesday night attacked police stations in Shalatin, Badee and Abu Ramad, killing police Lieutenant Mahmoud Mairam and Private Mutwalli Abdallah of Ab Ramad police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said the invaders had earlier attacked a police station killing two policemen. The statement did not say when and where this previous incident had occured.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan and Egypt have been claiming a triangular piece of land in the extreme North-Eastern Sudan since 1956, when it gained independence from Britain that had ruled the country since 1890.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1992, Egypt occupied and annexed the area prompting a protest note from Khartoum to the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministry said the Egyptian attack on the police stations aims at the perpetuation of the occupation of Halayeb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt, it added, is massing vast numbers of troops in the area in the face of a very small and poorly armed police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Sudanese people are aware of their legitimate right to Halayeb and will not relinquish even an inch of it despite the Egyptian government's arrogance&quot;, the Ministry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt on Monday accused Sudan of masterminding the assassination bid against President Hosni Mubarak, as he arrived in Addis Ababa to attend the 31st Summit of the Organisation of African Unity. Sudan has denied the accusation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudanese Military Ruler, Gen. Omar El Bashir, who attended the meeting denied the accusation describing it as &quot;irresponsible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Egypt has a problem with the Islamic groups and it should address that problem instead of accusing Sudan of involvement in such incidents,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He left Addis Ababa for South Africa to join his family which had fled Burundi earlier, he disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He did not state the means and methods he intends to use to mobilise the international community on the situation in Burundi where the Hutu-Tutsi divide and political and ethnic violence are tearing the country apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former minister however stressed the &quot;personal&quot; nature of his decision. &quot;I discussed it with nobody,&quot; he said, adding that he had not quit his position &quot;to join any extremist group&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about his personal safety, Mgendahayo said he was living &quot;with friends&quot; in Johannesburg and was more worried about &quot;the safety of all Burundians&quot;. &quot;That is much more important than the life of one person,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He refused to say whether he was planning to apply for political asylum to the Pretoria government. &quot;I do not wish to comment on that issue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two communities, who have normally lived together in peace, are now clashing over land ownership.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka, Zambia (PANA) - Two former senior members of Zambia's ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) of President Frederick Chiluba in Lusaka Thursday announced that they will lead a splinter party from the MMD which they accused of incompetency and mismanaging national affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MMD former deputy treasurer Dean Mung'omba and party deputy national secretary Derrick Chitala who were last week expelled from the party said Thursday that they intended to form a rival faction committed to the MMD&quot;S original ideals of transparency, honesty and competent leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They claimed that the ruling party had been subverted by &quot;spineless opportunists, drug-traffickers, common crooks and yes-sayers&quot; who allegedly were out to purge &quot;independent-minded&quot; patriots committed to serving the cause ofthe people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MMD national secretary Brig. Gen. Godfrey Miyanda last Saturday announced the two men's expulsion by the party National Executive Committee (NEC) for allegedly bringing the organisation into disrepute by their constant public attacks of its policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They had earlier been suspended for similar reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mung'omba had announced earlier this year that he was to challenge Chiluba for the MMD presidency at the party convention scheduled for 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Mung'omba and Chitala had earlier been sacked by Chiluba as deputy ministers in charge of national planning and in the presidents office respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a press briefing Thursday Mung'omba accused Chiluba of &quot;hood-winking&quot; the public by declaring Zambia a &quot;christian nation&quot; which he said was mere smokescreen to hide government corruption, incompetence and mismanagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two spoke out strongly against government's alleged misapplication of the IMF-World Bank Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) which they said had brought misery to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They (MMD government) lack the capacity to stretch matters further on SAP. All they are able to do is sell state companies but fail to plan for the welfare of the people affected,&quot; said Mung'omba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mung'omba and Chitala are founder-members of the MMD formed in 1990 to spearhead the campaign for the introduction of multiparty politics in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over 20 former senior MMD government leaders have left Chiluba's government since 1992 after either being sacked or resigning. Almost all have cited rampant corruption, drug-trafficking and incompetence in the system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's former president, was re-elected Wednesday as leader of the country's major opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He beating incumbent party head Kebby Musokotwane during elections at the party's congress in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda received 1,916 votes against Musokotwane's 400 to grab his former post he had relinquished in 1992 when he &quot;retired&quot; from partisan politics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had, earlier in 1991, lost the country's presidency to Frederick Chiluba and his Movement for Multiparty Democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda, 71, came out of his brief political retirement in 1994 saying he wanted to wrestle power from Chiluba's government, which he accused of mismanaging the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His return caused divisions within the former ruling party between the pro-Kaunda faction and Musokotwane supporters, forcing the latest elections, which party members and supporters had said could help heal the rift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda had led UNIP since he formed it in 1960 to spearhead the country's independence movement from Britain. That was achieved in October 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Musokotwane has been voted out of power along with several of his supporters within the UNIP central committee. They includ his general secretary, the retired army lieutenant general, Benjamin Mibenge. Mibenge's post was scooped by Sebastian Zulu, a lawyer and Kaunda supporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP Vice President Patrick Mvunga, who had himself campaigned for the Kaunda camp, lost to Inyambo Yeta, senior chief of the Lozi ethnic group in western Zambia and son of the &quot;Litunga&quot; Ilute Yeta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Litunga is the region's equivalent of a paramaount chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the Lozi royal establishment are calling for some administrative autonomy for the region, in line with the &quot;Barotse agreement&quot; signed between Kaunda, the British and the Lozi kingdom in 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agreement quaranteed limited autonomy to the former British protectorate at its incorporation in the new independent Zambia in 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda never quite honoured the agreement during his 27 years in power and his choice of the litunga's son as possible future republican vice-presidential candidate is seen by political analysts here as a ploy to win political favours among the Lozis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (PANA) - The 256 journalists covering the 31st summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa collectively heaved a huge sigh of relief Wednesday when Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi struck the hammered the gavel to signal the end of the annual continental meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For journalists it was the end a week of hell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am glad it's all over now. I will go to the nearest bar and drink myself to nothing,&quot; South African-based Carlos Henriques of Channel Africa said. &quot;And I hope to get the next plane home.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Henriques spoke for virtually every journalist here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many had to put up with maddening bureaucracy and tight security in this East African nation of 60 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, the problem was to get accreditation. On arrival journalists were supposed to first get registered with the information ministry before proceeding to another venue for accreditation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This seemingly simple procedure could have taken less that 15 minutes.  But after shuttling back and forth several times from one place to the next, at one's own expense, the journalist finally gets two press cards. The hope is that the holder of one card could attend the 62nd session of the council of ministers and the other, one is convinced, would give you access to the opening session of the African heads of state and government summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, no sooner the journalist gets his press badges the journalist realises problems are just beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Try going to a nearby hotel for an interview with the minister from your country. It is a five-minute walk. With your press card securely clipped to your lapel you do not expect problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As you walk a few minutes to your destination, you become a little apprehensive when you see a crowd of people and the inevitable policemen or two seemingly in charge. An armed soldier hovers nearby menacingly, his eyes missing nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You bulldoze your way into the crowd and find yourself faced with a policemen. you politely tell him you are going for an interview with the minister. He tells you firmly and impolitely that you cannot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Because there will be a head of state arriving two hours from now,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Again politely, you tell him that in during that period you will have finished your interview and probably be back at your hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Can you be let through?&quot; you ask, almost pleading now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Impossible!&quot; the officer says and looks yonder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You learn later that when an Ethiopian policeman says &quot;Impossible&quot;, apparently one of the few English words he can speak, he means it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, you take the nearest taxi to your hotel. That 10-minute drive takes you 55 times as long because all roads have been cordoned off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day of the summit's opening security is even tighter. Despite your accreditation badge you are told you cannot enter the hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have never seen anything like this in 20 years as a journalist,&quot; a journalist for an international news agency told the Zimbabwe Inter Africa News Agency, ZIANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You wonder why they gave us the press cards in the first place. If this is the type of organisation all over Africa, then I wish you guys a lot of luck,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Journalists complained of harassment by police in trying to get news to the outside world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation's Obriel Mpofu was nearly beaten by a policeman at the airport Sunday when he tried to force his way to cover the arrival of President Robert Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He and other colleagues from Zimbabwe had been waiting four hours to cover the arrival of the leaders. They had been promised by Ethiopian security that they would be allowed in later. This was never to be. Police had become notorious for promising to help and not delivering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Officials here seem to run around very much pretending to be busy but they really do nothing,&quot; another African journalist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That we have managed to write something at all about this conference should be the eighth wonder of the world,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After hours of chasing a story and finally getting it, the problems is not over. You can take up to two hours, or more, trying to file. This is because of antiquated equipment and the few telephone and telefax lines available for use by journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So if you are a journalist and want to cover an OAU summit when it comes back to Addis Ababa, one can only wish you Good Luck. Hopefully Cameroon, the next venue, will be a better experience.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bulletin, issued by the U.S. Information Agency, said that President Bill Clinton called Mubarak Monday and offered United States help to Egypt and Ethiopia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither Egypt nor Ethiopia have asked the United States for any specific assistance in the investigations, the publication said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at 26 June ceremonies in the Western American city of San Francisco, marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, Clinton urged the UN to take up the mantle in the fight against terrorism around the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Opposition elements of Sudan have offices in Cairo and Kampala where they get support and protection from the authorities of the two countries&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eritrea in December 1994 severed relations with Sudan, accusing the Khartoum government of training terrorists to undermine its security. Sudan denied the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bashir regretted the Eritrean decision to host the opposition meeting, saying Sudan stood by Eritreans when they fought for self-determination against Ethiopian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently, Uganda broke-off diplomatic relation with Sudan accusing it of supporting opposition forces fighting the government of President Yoweri Museveni. Sudan has also accused Uganda of supporting the rebel Sudanese Peoples' Liberation Army (SPLA) which has been fighting Khartoum governments since 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt also points accusing fingers at Sudan following Monday's assassination attempt on President Hosni Mubarak soon after he arrive in Addis Ababa for the Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sudanese leader denied that his country was involved in the incident and told Egyptian authorities not to attack other countries for its internal political problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There already exists problem between islamic fundamenta- lists and the Egyptian authorities, leading to deaths of which no government in Sudan has anything to do with. We reject the name of sudan being associated with political terrorism&quot;, said Bashir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that there was no proof that his country supported terrorism, saying Khartoum condemns all forms of violence and &quot;prefers dialogue instead of violence to resolve disputes&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peter Sibanda, Zinatha secretary for legal affairs and culture said in an interview the CD4 cell count of all the patients had increased from about 100 to 600 and more and symptoms of AIDS such as weight loss, diarrhoea and various dermatological signs had disappeared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cd count is measure of the level of infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sibanda said, however, although the symptoms had disappeared, the patients had remained HIV positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The patients involved in the trials had come forward with severe diarrhoea and abdominal pains, among other complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trials, which began in October 1993, were conducted to quantify the extent and potential benefits of some herbs in the treatment of aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sibanda said Zinatha and Zimbabwe's Blair Research Institute had agreed that the herbal concotions that were being used by traditional healers now be tested in the laboratory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tests would indicate exact components that are able to reduce infection and raise the white blood cell count.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The machines have been put in place as part of the national effort to control widespread iodine deficiency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the World Health Organisation, iodine deficiency is endemic throughout Sudan, except for the eastern zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is known to cause inflamation of the lymphatic gland as well as retard mental and physical development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Radiologist Siddiq Mustafa of Sudan's National Centre for Tumours says while iodine deficiency is a problem, the body is capable of regulating excess intakes of the chemical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from taking iodized salt, the chemical can be administered through iodized oil capsules. These are widely used in parts of western Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Campaigns to educate the population on the need to take idodized salt have also been launched throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iodization of table salt is done simply by mixing iodine with the table salt prepared for sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan is a major table salt producer. Its salt is produced by simply evaporating the saline water of the Red Sea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's National Aids Control Programme (NACP) coordinator Everisto Marowa said on Thursday Zimbabwe lacked political commitment in trying to curb the spread of the killer disease, AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview, Marowa said aids prevention and control programmes could never be successful without political support and commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said political leaders had an obligation towards the community and should, therefore, treat aids as an important issue which required their maximum support in controlling the spread of the disease in their provinces.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministry of health and child welfare has already proposed that AIDS should be accorded a &quot;national priority&quot; but government has been slow in responding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIDS has claimed more than 38 552 lives in Zimbabwe since the first reported cases in 1987. it also believed that more than 60 000 children have been orphaned as a result of the deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NACP is currently holding a 10-day national training course to improve the the management of AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) prevention and control programmes at non-governmental organisations, the private sector, government and provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The course, being attended by 30 people involved in AIDS/STD prevention and control activities, is being funded by the World Health Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sixty percent of people with sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis have been found to be hiv positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are holding a multi-sectoral national course, but I think there is a lot that still needs to be done. There is need for maximum political commitment in our efforts to curb the spread of AIDS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want politicians to regard AIDS as an important aspect affecting human and social development. It is fine that we are training people at different levels, but it has to be supported by an explicit political commitment,&quot; Marowa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said ways that political leaders could show their commitment was by providing channels of correct information about AIDS and STD, encouraging people to change their behaviour and providing necessary support to people with hiv and AIDS, their families and orphans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, zambia, (PANA) - Calm returned to Chingola on Wednesday, after thousands of residents rioted on Tuesday to protest the high crime rate in the Zambian copper mining town in the Copperbelt Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Copperbelt Police Chief, Martin Nasilele said on Wednesday that Chingola which had been rocked by sporadic gunfire throughout Tuesday as policemen fought the rioters was quiet on Wednesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The riot in which thousands of residents fought pitched street battles with police was sparked off by the shooting to death of a 22-year-old man in the early hours of Tuesday by suspected armed bandits.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unconfirmed reports say the man, Boyd Mmwanza, may have been shot by police anti-robbery squad at around 02.00 hours (00.00 gmt) at his home. The gunmen left after killing him in front of his family without stealing anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police shot two 15-year-old schoolboys, Mode Kalembe and Godfrey Chifulo, in the legs on Tuesday as the residents went on rampage, partially burning a Post Office, looted a hotel and bar and stoned a police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The enraged residents who accused the police of conniving with bandits in commiting crimes, rushed the two boys to a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But they blocked doctors from treating the boys whom they later took on a stretcher to a police station where they stoned the policemen and shattered the building's window panes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The policemen, outnumbered by the rioters, fired tear gas cannisters at the rampaging residents in Chabanyama, Chiwempala, Maiteneke and Chikola townships as they fought running battles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nasilele said on Wednesday that police arrested 36 people during one of the worst rioting in the town which is home to one of the world's largest open pit Copper Mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said police would investigate complaints by the residents that the local policemen connived with bandits to commit crimes in the town.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bujumbura, Burundi (PANA) - The chairman of the main opposition Union for National Progress Party, (UPRONA) in the Burundian parliament, Frederic Ngenzebuhoro, has expressed dismay at the rejection of President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya's request for special powers to help restore peace in the strife-torn country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refusal, he said, was paradoxically supported by members of the ruling FRODEBU (Front for Democracy in Burundi) in the parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement made public immediately after the negative vote of the 38 FRODEBU MPs (against UPRONA's 13), Ngenzebuhoro denounced &quot;the MPs' hostility to measures simply aimed at restoring peace in a country which is openly at war&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He asked the President to use &quot;all his constitutional prerogatives so that parliament can never again be an obstacle to the smooth operation of government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For his part, the minister of institutional reforms and relations with parliament, Therence Sinunguruza, regretted the astonishing collective vote of FRODEBU MPs against the exceptional measures which were submitted to him, given that an MP's mandate is individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that the government must go all out and institute exceptional measures, even if it meant dissolving parliament to give itself the means to manage the situation. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has warned that he &quot;will assume his responsibilites when necessary, should the parliament vote against the demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman of the FRODEBU parliamentary group, Corneille Budigiye, said his party was against the request on the grounds that &quot;the army should not be given exceptional powers as it played a major part in the current political and ethnic crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 21 June, the President asked parliament to allow him to &quot;rule by decree for a period of three months&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The request mainly concerned political, administrative and legal institutions, as well as guarantees for citizens' fundamental rights and obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would also include changing the Burundian passport, abolishing radio broadcasts of party political programmes, media censorship, a country-wide dusk-to-dawn curfew, ban on demonstrations and the issuing of passes for movements from one province to another.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commissioner's representative in Zambia, Abou Moussa, said in Lusaka Tuesday that although Zambia and the his agency had finalised plans for the repartriation, the Angolan government had proposed 4 July for the final meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moussa said Zambia has rejected the date because it coincided with major public holidays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are yet to agree on fresh dates,&quot; He said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a joint communique from the Zambian capital Lusaka on Wednesday after the 14th meeting of the council of ministers of the Zambezi River Authority, the two ministers said the water situation in the Zambezi basin was the worst since 1907, resulting in little water being collected in the Kariba Dam for hydro-electric power generation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The normal inflow in the Kariba dam is 1 100 cubic metres per second but the flow in the 1994/95 rainy season has been 450 cubic metres per second.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Higher mortality rates or lowered life expectancy caused partly by unsafe birth practises and lack of financial control of health care expenditures have been cited by a population expert as the most critical health problems for most African women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khadijat Mojidi, deputy director of African programmes at the Centre for Development and Population Activities has advocated the training of traditional midwives in addition to economic empowerement of women as part of the solution to the problem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mojidi said that higher mortality rates for women in Africa were disabling for their families and had incalculable effects on the community as a whole, the &quot;Washingtoin Line&quot; reported wednesday..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Women die in the prime of their lives and they are responsible for so many other members of the community. That means they are unable to realise their own potential and not able to participate in national development,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said part of the solution should be to remove what she called gender inequities between men and women in Africa. She said these tended to favour men in income generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mojidi urged linking health programmes with other social community activities in which women are involved to gain basic knowledge on healthcare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such a system is said to be bearing positive results in some parts of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - As Burundi's political and security situations continue to degenerate, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has warned the country's leaders that Africa will no longer sit by and watch the killings and exodus of people from the Central Africa State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa and the International Community should not allow the recurrence of the war in Rwanda&quot; where the world stood-by and watched thousands of people being massacred last year, the Secretary-General of the OAU, Salim Ahmed Salim said at a News conference in Addis Ababa on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Burundi situation, he popinted out, has no clarity where the country is going, and warned: &quot;I shall include nothing and exclude nothing depending on the development of the situation in Burundi&quot;. He would not say whether this meant sending an intervention force into the country should the situation deteriorate further.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African leaders, in a resolution on Burundi at the end of their Summit, condemned the militarization of the Burundi society which they said had resulted in the proliferation of Militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leaders asked Salim and the OAU Central Organ for Conflict Resolution to monitor the situation and to take whatever decision is appropriate in conformity new developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi was thrown into ethnic violence after the assassination in October, 1993 of the country's first democratically elected President, Melchior Ndadaye of the majority Hutu ethnic group in a failed coup attempt by elements of the army which is dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country's Foreign Minister resigned over the week-end, saying the government had failed to provide security to all the people of Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim said Africa's expectation was that the Burundi political and military institutions should work in the interest of the people and not at cross purposes as leaders of Hutu, Tutsi or Twa, the three ethnic groups of the tiny Central African Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim said the African leaders decided at the end of their Summit that all the Burundi political leaders be invited to Addis Ababa, to meet the current chairman of the OAU, President Meles Zenawi, to examine possibilities of resolving the crisis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The 31st Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit ended Wednesday with renewed commitment by leaders of the 53-nation grouping to end conflicts and bloodbaths on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi, slowly degenerating into anarchy, was given a thinly veiled threat by OAU leaders who said they would not stand by while Africans massacred each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will do what we can through diplomacy,&quot; said OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim at a closing press conference, adding: &quot;But beyond that we...exclude nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa would again not stand aloof if a fresh bloodbath, like the one which killed over a million people in neighbouring Rwanda, broke out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim, who described this year's summit as the most &quot;profound&quot; in trying to address conflicts in Africa, said the African leaders had shown more commitment to prevent further conflict on the continent which has seen over seven million people escaping to neighbouring countries as refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said all leaders of rival parties in Burundi would be summoned to the OAU headquarters in Addis Ababa to explain their positions and the OAU would then decide what action to take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They (Burundians) must live beyond ethnic affiliations,&quot; said Salim.  &quot;We cannot let the situation degenerate. Everything that needs to be done will be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said, however, it was the United Nations which had the mandate of peacekeeping throughout the world and the OAU had never discussed the issue of a peacekeeping force although it would be happy to be a peacekeeping observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the OAU's emphasis was on diplomacy and not sending in troops.  This had been endorsed by the heads of state who agreed to strengthen the mechanisms of preventing conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A central organ would be established to monitor the situation in Africa and take &quot;whatever decisions in conformity with the developments of any country in order to avert a deterioration of the situation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim had been mandated by the leaders to monitor the situation closely in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OAU secretariat would establish a management centre for conflict prevention and early warning systems would be put in place to avert conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Member countries were expected to contribute not less than USD 1 million towards the organisation's peace fund. Other donations were being sourced from other nations and organisations throughout the world, said Salim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit, he said, would be remembered as the one where heads of government came out with more determination to stem conflicts in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would also go down as one which enforced mechanisms for prompt payment of contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the summit, the organisation was owed USD 64 million but this has been reduced to USD 38 million after members were threatened with sanctions which included being denied the right to speak at oau fora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already some USD 3 million had been collected for the fiscal year 1995/96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim was firm in denying that the OAU would be happy with a stand-by force, ready to pounce on any truant member country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nothing of that sort has ever been proposed by this Secretary-General,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The role of peacekeeping was left to the United Nations, but as happened in Rwanda when the un &quot;firmly but politely&quot; declined to send a peacekeeping force, the oau would be left with no choice to ensure a stop in a possible escalation of conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OAU would do what it could to calm down the situation in Sudan and Eritrea, which have been at each other's throats with Sudan accusing her neighbour of harbouring islamic extremists bent on overthrowing the khartoum government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa has nothing to gain but everything to lose in the case of escalation of conflict between Sudan and Eritrea,&quot; Salime said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Sudanese President Omar Mohamed Hassan al-Bashia has strongly denied that Sudanese were involved in the attempted assassination of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, minutes after arriving for the OAU summit meeting on monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said to the contrary, his country wanted to co-operate closely with the Cairo government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, African heads of state were leaving Addis Ababa after the end of their three-day summit described as &quot;frank, businesslike and profound&quot; by Salim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabawe (PANA) - The development and expansion of capital markets in Eastern and Southern Africa has been discouraged by the absence of a vibrant private sector, a senior government official said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening a two-day seminar on the development of capital markets in Eastern and Southern Africa in Harare, Industry and Commerce Minister Herbert Murerwa said there were only seven capital markets in a region of more than 20 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The development of capital markets is, in many ways, tied up with the development of enterprises,&quot; Murerwa told the 100 participants from the 23 Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) member states.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As banks and advisers on financial matters, you are all in influential positions to assist enterprises to develop and grow into entities that can qualify for stock exchange listing&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Domestic savings in the Sub-Region were too low, and the gap between savings and investment continued to increase, despite implementation of the International Monetary Fund-inspired economic reforms by countries in the region, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It will be worthwhile for you to consider the availability of investible funds and the strategies that can be adopted by capital markets to increase savings in order to match investment,&quot; said Murerwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was also the need to encourage the culture of paper investment in the region, and educate the general public in the virtues of investing in securities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sub-Saharan Africa region had only seven established capital markets located in Johannesburg, Nairobi, Harare, Port Louis, Swaziland, Lusaka and Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from Johannesburg, the stock markets were weak and underdeveloped with no more than 90 securities listed on each of the stock exchanges in Nairobi and Harare - regarded as more developed capital markets in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, over the past two decades, Africa's share of foreign direct investment remained stagnant, hovering around ZD one billion (USD 125 million) and declined by 7.8 percent as a percentage of total resource inflows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Figures compiled by the United Nations showed that Sub-Saharan Africa's capital stock plummeted from ZD 168 billion (USD 20 billion) in 1980 to ZD 10.9 billion (USD 91.56 billion) in 1990, said Murerwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the view that domestic savings are low and foreign investment is getting more and more difficult to attract, our Sub-Region must move quickly to establish formal capital markets...strengthen existing ones,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, COMESA Secretary-General Bingu Wa r Mutharika told participants that lack of capital markets in Eastern and Southern Africa was a major obstacle to development and poverty alleviation in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seminar was jointly organised by the COMESA Bankers Association and the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 26, 2995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Dan Agbese</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trying to turn Abiola into a symbol of democracy is like putting lipstick on a frog&quot;--an unnamed &quot;specialist in Nigerian politics&quot; quoted by Time magazine in its issue of April 3, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An unkind cut? Maybe. But truth be told, Mashood Abiola was an unlikely candidate for confronting the military's usurpation of political power for 25 of the nation's thirty-five years of independence. He has no track records as a fighter for democracy or civil rule in Nigeria. Nothing he did or said in public marked him out as a particular hater of military rule.  He wined and dined with the military. He was always their willing emissary in sticky situation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military more or less made Abiola. He made most of his money through them. Umaru Dikko (no love lost between them) accuses him of financing the 1983 coup against president Shehu Shagari. And the one against Muhammadu Buhari which brought his own friend, Ibrahim Babangida, to power.  Discretion must have advised him not to deny the charge. The manipulation of the transition programme by the military enjoyed his overt support. His newspaper chain canvassed that position. It worked to his personal gain and gave Abiola the opportunity to contest the presidential election of June 12, 1993. He had refused to join either of the two political parties, NRC or SDP because he said he was through with politics. But by January, 1993, he changed his mind. Babangida's ban on all the 23 presidential aspirants cleared the way for Abiola. He joined the SDP for the singular objective of contesting the presidential election as the party's candidate. The party gave him the thumbs up. Many people saw a carefully choreographed ploy by the military to hand over power to their trusted friend, Moshood Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It all looked like a sick joke. Not many people gave him much chance at the polls. They did not reckon with God's penchant for the mysterious. As it turned out, Abiola, the unfancied horse in the presidential race, sprang the kind of surprise that always brings the carefully stacked dominoes tumbling down. And the friend became the Nemesis, a fish bone in the throat of the military and a millstone on Nigeria's neck. Because of Abiola, Babangida left office in rather shabby circumstances. Because of Abiola Ernest Shonekan, head of the Interim National Government, was in power all of three months. A record. Because of Abiola Nigeria has not quite known peace for two years now. And the nation feels like a country condemned to live under the Sword of Damocles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola. Whoever thought this would happen, that twenty-five years after the civil war to keep the country together, Nigerians would still be wondering if their country is a united nation or a patchwork of tribal enclaves held together with the thin thread. Before June 12, 1993, the political history of Nigeria could have been written entirely with Abiola's name absent. Unless, of course, one took note of his role in the Second Republic in diluting the political influence of that Yoruba icon, the late Obafemi Awolowo. June 12, 1993, changed all that. Nothing has been quite the same in Nigeria. Not politics. Not the economy. Abiola looms large in the contemporary political history of Nigeria. Talk of disintegration? Abiola.  Talk of confederation? Abiola. Humpty Dumpty was allowed to fall and the prized wisdom of our politicians and academics is at a loss for a satisfactory answer. Logjam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luck? Fate? Whatever you choose to call it, it reminds us that there is irony in the affairs of man. Change sometimes comes from unlikely sources.  A dirt poor boy became a wealthy philanthropist. And a dark horse was galloping home with the ultimate prize when the military struck with the annulment. Oh, how it passes all the understanding!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is Moshood Abiola a symbol of democracy? The answer depends on what you make of symbols. Positive, if symbol means someone as the fulcrum of a certain cause of action. Negative, if symbol refers to someone who has spent most of his life, a la Nelson Mandela, in the vanguard of a struggle for the greatest good of the greatest number of people. Or, at least, to change an unhealthy, inhuman system to a health, human system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We must settle for a middle ground. The fight for civil rule in Nigeria centres on Abiola, the victim of a perceived political injustice. It was he who contested and won (?) the election which was annulled. You can't take that from him. When labour went on its first political strike last year, the demand was for an Abiola presidency. Pro-democracy movements, individuals and organizations, local or international, fight on his side. Whatever was his past, whatever was his record, all is forgotten, all is forgiven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To be sure, he is not a perfect symbol for democracy or even civil rule. There is the taint of his relationship with the military and his loud silence on the democratic process in an endless transition. But more importantly, there is the vagueness of where he can be found in politics--with the hound or with the hare. No one knows for sure what he stands for in politics. When he campaigned for the presidency, his manifesto was remarkable for its inarticulateness. He promised to banish poverty in Nigeria but he had no clue on how to work the magic all nations would be glad to buy from him. His political ideology suffers from the same lack of definitiveness. In the Second Republic, he was in the National Party of Nigeria, NPN. Right of centre. In the Third Republic, he was in the Social Democratic Party, SDP. Left of centre. He moves, it appears, where the spirit of political ambition pushes him. But no one can tell you not buy a used car from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the peculiar politics of Nigeria, Abiola as a symbol of democracy is diminished by primordial politics and ethnicism. He is not the defining agent of a resurgent democratic yearning in a country with its remarkable ambivalence about its form of government. As a symbol, he should enlarge the Nigerian nation. Instead, there is a contradiction imposed by the blurred vision of ethnicity. As a symbol, he should mean the same thing to most people. But he does not because the tribe refuses to make way for nationalism. His pronouncements have been those of an injured, tribal man.  Not of a statesman. These stain the symbol. It is not his fault. It is in the peculiar habit of fate not to always have a banner without stain. But for Nigerians, even of time and circumstance distant from June 12, 1993, the date and the man still remind us that even in the admittedly murky world of third world politics, there is sometimes not enough sand to cover the murk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the African Development Foundation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADF FOSTERS SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH DIRECT AID TO THE GRASSROOTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Congress, recognizing the need to establish a small, flexible agency to provide development assistance directly to grassroots communities in Africa, created the African Development Foundation (ADF) as an enterprising, value-added alternative to traditional assistance programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where traditional development agencies typically provide assistance to central governments to carry out large capital-intensive projects, ADF works directly with grassroots people to reduce poverty and effect positive social change through small, local, private sector development projects that deliver lasting benefits long after ADF ceases its involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since FY 1984, ADF has funded more than 500 small-scale, private-sector development projects in 26 African nations. Many of these projects have served as laboratories for innovative, cost-effective approaches to development-- testing strategies to maximize sustainability, local control, and capacity building--that often have been adopted by other development agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Employing a participatory, &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach to economic development, ADF supports African grassroots recipients:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * In their own efforts;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * To design and implement their own strategies;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * To resolve their own problems; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * To promote their own economic progress.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, ADF-funded projects focus on inducing lasting, self-sufficient economic and social outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, with a modest annual budget of $16.9 million, ADF continues to successfully fulfill its Congressional mandate. By focusing on achieving attainable goals in countries most likely to benefit from U.S. development assistance, ADF concentrates on alleviating poverty and creating durable, small-scale, market economies in desperately poor, mostly rural areas of Africa where no such economies previously existed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, ADF demonstrates appropriate and responsible use of limited foreign assistance dollars that helps promote a U.S. foreign policy committed to promoting democratic participation, self-sufficiency, and income generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TYPES OF PROJECTS FUNDED BY ADF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADF responds to project proposals designed by grassroots African community organizations, providing grants to local cooperatives, farmers' associations, youth organizations, community service associations, women's groups, and others in the local private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the small size and non-bureaucratic, non-governmental nature of ADF-funded projects, the U.S. government can readily see where and how its money is being put to good use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADF primarily supports income-generating projects in five areas:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Micro-enterprise development,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Agriculture and animal husbandry,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Credit,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Irrigation and water supply, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Energy and the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By law, ADF cannot fund any of the above activities for an amount greater than $250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHAT ADF DOES NOT FUND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Government organizations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Organizations not based on the African continent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Capital intensive projects that emphasize large-scale building and construction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Relief activities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Development grants for private individuals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Major infrastructure projects; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Scholarships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRICANS WORKING TO HELP AFRICANS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike traditional development agencies, ADF does *not* incur the expense of maintaining expatriate staff in the field. Instead, supporting ADF grantees are Country Liaison Officers (CLOs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In each country, the CLO is a highly trained and experienced African development specialist, who works directly with, and for, grantees and potential grantees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CLO assists grantees and potential grantees in:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Drafting project proposals;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Identifying competent technical assistance providers among local development experts and organizations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Obtaining any available assistance from their own governments; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Monitoring projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, each CLO is a cost-effective, value-added liaison between private-sector grantees and ADF, helping to insure that U.S. dollars are being used wisely and providing maximum benefits for grantees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHY ADF IS A UNIQUE ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL FOREIGN AID</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADF provides assistance directly to the private sector-- local cooperatives, farmers' associations, youth organizations, community service organizations, women's groups, and similar organizations--not to governments or state-owned enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADF grants range from $700 to a maximum of $250,000; average FY 1994 development grant, $124,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every ADF project must have an income-generating component to foster long-term viability of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of funding national, capital-intensive projects, ADF supports small, limited projects that directly address the specific needs of local peoples in their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather than incur the expense of supporting expatriates abroad, ADF keeps project costs down by employing highly trained and experienced African development specialists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADF SEEKS EVEN GREATER EFFICIENCY AS A STEWARD OF SCARCE U.S. FOREIGN AID $$$</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In October, 1993--prior to Vice-President Gore's call for a National Performance Review and before the 104th Congress set forth its new priorities for U.S. foreign aid--ADF launched a self-initiated ten-year self-assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To maximize objectivity, the evaluation was conducted by an &quot;Assessment Review Committee&quot; composed of Congressional staff, academicians, and representatives from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the General Accounting Office (GAO), and Office of Technology Assessment (OTA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADF's principal reasons for undertaking this assessment were to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Evaluate the broad impact of its programs;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Determine which aspects of its programs and procedures work best;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Systematically document and share its &quot;lessons learned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee oversaw the review of more than 200 ADF grants and found that the vast majority of ADF projects were meeting their stated goals and objectives. The assessment found that ADF's program is working well and documented that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * More than two-thirds of ADF projects produce increased income and/or needed services for participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * More than half of ADF projects increase the skills and knowledge of participants through training and technical assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the vast majority of ADF projects, participants are actively involved in implementation of project activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most ADF projects produce sufficient income and possess management capabilities to continue to produce benefits for participants long after ADF funding has ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, ADF contracted with an international management consulting firm to explore ways ADF can streamline its operations, both at ADF/Washington and in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, ADF's board of directors has established the following goals for the Foundation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Reduce the number of active countries to which ADF extends grants by at least 20 percent in FY 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Reduce the number of employees at ADF by at least 17 percent in FY 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Reduce ADF's overhead expenses by at least 16 percent in FY 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1984, ADF's goal has been to continuously improve its operations to maximize the benefit of limited dollars available for U.S. foreign aid.  And it will continue to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A TYPICAL RURAL ADF-FUNDED PROJECT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kalijiisa Blacksmith and Farmers Association Project typifies a rural ADF-funded project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Location: Kalijiisa, a remote village in the Upper East Region of Ghana, 725 miles north of Accra, Ghana's capital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grant recipient: Kalijiisa Blacksmiths and Farmers Association (membership: 78 men; 50 women).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Project funded: In 1990, ADF granted the cooperative $148,000 to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Build and equip a workshop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Begin a reforestation program</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Increase agricultural production</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Purchase a grinding mill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1993, an additional $81,000 was granted for:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Purchasing a tractor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Building a storage facility for farm produce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Building classrooms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Results: Four years after the original ADF funding:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Kalijiisa is the region's top cultivator of rice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * 800 trees have been planted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Local children and adults are receiving literacy training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Ten additional townsmen have been trained as blacksmiths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * In addition to hoes and plows, blacksmiths now produce cooking pots, bicycle carts, and iron furniture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Using their earnings as capital, cooperative has expanded into a chain of small retail outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Last year, the cooperative earned more than $10,000, an enormous sum of money for the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, Kalijiisa's quality products are in high demand in northern Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The capital provided by ADF helped this group turn a traditional activity into a thriving business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A TYPICAL URBAN ADF-FUNDED PROJECT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Spring Cabinet Furniture Manufacturing Project typifies an urban ADF-funded project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Location: Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grant Recipient: Spring Cabinet Cooperative Society, Ltd. (original membership: 10 men)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Project Funded: In 1987, ADF granted the cooperative $217,035 to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Provide low-cost, quality wood furniture for consumers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Employ craftspeople and provide vocational training opportunities for recent school graduates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Purchase machinery, tools, timber for furniture making</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1989, an additional $25,542 was granted for the purchase of a sawdust exhaust system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Results: Eight years after the original ADF funding:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Spring Cabinet was named Zimbabwe's 1993 Small Business of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Earnings have risen dramatically, from nearly $700,000 in 1992 to more than $1 million in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Profits have been reinvested, qualifying Spring Cabinet for an overdraft credit line with a local commercial bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Spring Cabinet's payroll has risen from 10 to 178 employees; and with the construction of an expanded facility, the group continues to expand its operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, Spring Cabinet produces dressers, bedroom suites, dining room suites, and cabinets from locally available wood. It also imports fabric and oak from the United States. Originally targetting its products for low-income consumers, Spring Cabinet's quality furniture is now purchased by upper-income consumers, government offices, and private business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADF's minimal investment provided the necessary start-up capital for this group to become one of Zimbabwe's major furniture suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADF AT A GLANCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Created by U.S. Congress, 1980; began assistance to African grassroots organizations, 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Current annual budget, $16.9 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Makes grants directly to local private sector organizations, not through governments or state-owned enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overseen by seven-member Board of Directors: five uncompensated members from the private sector, appointed by President of the United States with advice and consent of U.S. Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mission:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Provide support to small, private sector development efforts;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Support long-term local development strategies;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Support research on grassroots development issues by African researchers working directly with local peoples; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Facilitate dissemination of development information at community level throughout Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1984, ADF has funded 415 development projects and 123 research projects in 34 African counties. Average FY 1994 development grant: $124,000.  Average FY 1994 research grant: $25,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Generally, development projects involve from 10 to 2,000 participants, with up to 10,000 beneficiaries for largest, most comprehensive local or regional undertakings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADF supports small, limited projects that directly address the specific needs of local peoples in their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the non-bureaucratic, non-governmental nature of ADF-funded projects, the U.S. government can readily see how its money is being put to good use.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a $16.9 million budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 and $17.4 million proposed by the Clinton administration for FY 1996, the federally funded African Development Foundation (ADF) is a small, innovative and effective agency with an distinct mandate to support grassroots development.  But if the direction set by votes so far this year in the House of Representatives is maintained, the ADF will suffer drastic cuts over the next two years, and be phased out entirely in FY 1988.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The appropriations bill passed by the House of Representatives last week (HR 1868) includes $10 million for ADF in FY1996, a 41 percent cut from this year's budget. The authorization bill passed earlier by the House (HR1561) further specifies a cut to $4 million in FY 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Senate will be considering parallel action in July and August, possibly continuing into September.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secret Trial Raises Fears For The Safety Of Respected Statesman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We the family of General Olusegan Obasanjo are asking the international community to intercede with the Nigerian authorities to demand the release of this respected statesman, who is chairman of the African Leadership Forum and a trustee of the Ford Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under arrest in Nigeria on unspecified charges, the general may be undergoing a secret trial and could be facing execution by the dictatorial government currently ruling the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An outspoken critic of continued military rule and advocate for democracy, General Obasanjo initially was arrested on March 13, then released at the behest of former President Jimmy Carter and other international figures on March 22 and confined to his home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allowed no access to outside communication, he was allowed to see only his wife and children until he was picked up again on the night of June 13 and taken to an undisclosed location. No word of his fate was given us until Sunday, June 18 when he was examined by a doctor at a military site and the doctor reported to us that he had lost considerable body weight, was excessively fatigued, and was suffering from high blood pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since his initial detention, the general has not been formally presented with any accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are demanding his release, or, if the authorities persist in holding him, an open trial with representation by a lawyer of his choosing and with international observers in attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Obasanjo served as military leader in Nigeria from 1978 to 1980, during which time he voluntarily organized democratic elections and handed over to an elected, civilian government. Since then, he has served on numerous international panels and commissions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 7, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Reg Rumney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indian economic involvement in South Africa has mushroomed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purchase by Indian brewery United Breweries Investments (UB) of a 30 percent stake in National Sorghum Breweries -- reportedly for R70-million -- is the most visible sign of the growing economic co- operation between South Africa and India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UB had previously bought Mabula Game Lodge in the Northern Transvaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade and business delegations from India have been streaming in since 1993, according to India's Deputy Consul General in South Africa, TP Seetharam.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the presence of the Indian community in South Africa, the country is something of an unknown quantity to Indian investors. &quot;There is a lot of interest, much of it exploratory. There is an information gap because of a lack of contact for four decades,&quot; says Seetharam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several major business chambers have visited South Africa, and have met counterparts in national and regional chambers such as the South African Chamber of Business, the National African Federated Chambers of Commerce as well as localised forums of Indian businessmen in Durban and Cape Town.  Interest ranges from pure trade to investment from, and in, Indian business.  In South Africa, the Indexpo '94 exhibition at Nasrec, in which 300 Indian companies took part, attracted 50 000 visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As India continues with the liberalisation policy started in 1990, it is encouraging investment overseas. Barriers to capital outflows have been scrapped, along with other restrictions on business. This has paid off, says Seetharam. Foreign exchange reserves have increased by $20-billion in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One major Indian conglomerate, Tuta, already has motor assembly operations in Southern Africa, making small trucks, and Seetharam says it has registered a company in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For potential Indian investors, Seetharam indicates decisions will be shaped by the special role the five or six major conglomerates play in the South African economy. Certainly, the UB investment will be watched to see how NBS fares in competition with natural monopoly South African Breweries.  But some Indian firms may want to take advantage of the dominance of the conglomerates by entering into partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opportunities for investment from South Africa abound as India opens up its once protected economy to the outside world. With around 900-million people, India is a vast market, with a legal system which won't be unfamiliar to South Africa, and with English as the language of business. On top of this there are various investment incentives, such as Export Processing Zones where wholly owned firms are tax exempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual South African firms and individuals, rather than trade delegations, have visited India, says Seetharam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are opportunites, for example, for private sector investment in the building of toll roads, and guarantees are being given of a return on investment in the power sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African investment in the mining sector is a natural development, and India has resources which Seetharam says could be more efficiently mined. De Beers is looking at a diamond mine, he says, and the Chamber of Mines has sent a delegation to India to look at coal mining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extent of general economic involvement is best reflected in the trade figures. Trade has grown dramatically since 1990, off a low base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, imports from India totalled R406-million; exports to India from South Africa totalled around R488-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exports from South Africa tend to be raw materials: imports from India tend to be manufactured goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the myriad delegations, the trade balance is favourable to South Africa. Seetharam adds that it is even more favourable if exports of gold through London and diamonds through the Central Selling Organisation are added in. India is a big buyer of small diamonds. This is not surprising since gems and jewellery are the biggest export category, with an 18 percent share of all exports at $3 991-million in 1992-93. Pearls, precious and semi-precious stones rank third, with an 11 percent share of imports at $2 641-million in that period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic involvement doesn't stop at trade and investment. India's Housing and Development Corporation is to help in encouraging and training communities to get involved in low-cost housing, Seetharam says, the idea being that housing is not a product which governments deliver but a process which government starts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another area in which he says South Africa can learn some policy lessons from India is in small- and medium- scale enterprises (SMEs) -- and he emphasises that this is not restricted to low-tech or informal sector operations. Many goods now produced by big companies can be outsourced to small companies. Moreover, such goods are not restricted to the local market.  Seetharam says around 45 percent of Indian export earnings come from goods made by SMEs. Indian companies and agencies can help South Africa stimulate the small business sector.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 7, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Gaye Davis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEPUTY President Thabo Mbeki has pledged that a woman will be first choice to fill any minister's or deputy minister's post that becomes vacant in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki made the commitment when addressing women from NGOs countrywide, who gathered at Midrand last weekend in preparation for a global forum on women, which starts in Beijing at the end of August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki also said the government would try to ratify the United National Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Cedaw) by August 9 -- Women's Day. And he said the proposed Office on the Status of Women -- long-awaited national machinery to promote women's advancement -- would be based in the Office of the State President.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His pledges were met with delight by delegates. Nomtuse Mbere, convenor of the non-governmental organisation (NGO) planning committee for Beijing, said while the name of the Office on the Status of Women could change, it would &quot;ensure all ministries work towards the advancement of women&quot; by liaising with ministry-based gender desks and scrutinising budgets. Women wanted it based in the President's office, she said. &quot;If it was a separate ministry, it would not have enough power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1 300 NGOs are accredited for a global NGO forum to run from August 30 to September 8 at Huairou, a Chinese resort town some distance from Beijing. It is designed to complement the United Nations-sponsored Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing's Asian Games Village, which runs from September 4 to 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beijing will be a conference of commitment on the part of governments, which will set the agenda as far as women are concerned for the next 10 years,&quot; Mbere said. &quot;The Midrand conference was a chance for women in civil society to identify what they want the government to commit to.&quot; Major areas of concern included the burden of poverty borne by women, the need for economic empowerment, employment creation and affirmative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposals would go to the National Preparatory Committee for Beijing, chaired by deputy minister of welfare Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-strong South African government delegation, to be led by Speaker of the National Assembly, Frene Ginwala, will include a number of reserved places for NGO representatives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 7, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Goldstone report urging action against police 'dirty tricks' was never released by president FW de Klerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Stefaans Brummer and Eddie Koch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Mail &amp; Guardian today publishes a secret Goldstone Commission report, sent to former President FW de Klerk weeks before the April 27 election, and which urged immediate action to &quot;neutralise&quot; police security structures involved in &quot;murder, fraud, blackmail and political disinformation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report recommended that then-police chief General Johan van der Merwe and senior generals be &quot;effectively relieved of their positions forthwith&quot;, saying it &quot;is a bleak prospect that this country enters its first democratic election with this security structure in place&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk failed to act against Van der Merwe and the police branch which Judge Richard Goldstone implicated, the Crime Intelligence Service (successor to the security branch), and Van der Merwe retired only in March a year later. While Van der Merwe maintained his resignation was voluntary, the M&amp;G has information that he was forced out by Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosive document -- to which President Nelson Mandela's office and key government of national unity figures had access, but which was never made public -- was given to the M&amp;G by former security policeman Paul Erasmus this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The report corroborates statements I have made over the last three weeks and rebuts claims by FW de Klerk and a senior member of the police that they were unaware of or not involved in covert actions against the liberation movements,&quot; Erasmus said. &quot;The reports show these activities included bombings and other Third Force activities that continued well after the release of Mandela and various agreements with the ANC to end them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report raises serious questions about the role of De Klerk, who appears to have handed his successor a political hot potato, despite the urgent request from Goldstone that &quot;immediate steps must be taken to neutralise the activities of the CIS&quot; before the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may also be asked why the ANC-led government of national unity did not release the report publicly after the elections. And why it took a year before Van der Merwe was forced out and new police commissioner George Fivaz appointed. Sources suggest Mandela's concerns about a possible police revolt may have caused him to sit on the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fink Haysom, legal advisor to Mandela, yesterday said Mandela's office was &quot;not in a position to respond&quot; to the report. Although it had been made available to Mandela, &quot;this office has never received it as an official report. It appears to be Goldstone's advice to the office of the previous President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk, who is abroad, was unable to respond at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldstone is known originally to have favoured the public release of the report, like the 47 other reports he authored during the commission's three-year mandate to investigate violence. Goldstone was apparently convinced otherwise, but, betraying his strong feelings, said in November: &quot;The information, I imagine, will go to the Truth Commission. The information should be made public then. If it's not made public, I will do so ... as a citizen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document was completed in the month before the April elections last year after lengthy investigation and evidence taken by Goldstone from a number of police witnesses who were kept in Denmark for security reasons. It said Van der Merwe -- and former Police Minister Adrian Vlok -- would have been aware of the criminal activities outlined in the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An unfortunately large number of police officers currently holding high office, including the Commissioner of Police, were not only aware of some of the earlier criminal activities, but must have approved them and the funds which were neccessary to have made them possible. So, too, according to the commission's evidence, the then Minister of Law and Order, Mr A Vlok,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a bleak prospect that this country enters its first democratic election with this security structure in place,&quot; it adds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldstone handed the report to the international investigating team under Transvaal attorney-general Jan D'Oliveira, charged with bringing security force members involved in criminal activities to book, after it had been made available to De Klerk and Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D'Oliveira's team may use affidavits contained in the report in evidence against Eugene de Kok -- the former commander of the security police Vlakplaas unit now on trial for multiple murder and corruption -- and in prosecutions against other security force members. Erasmus asked that the affidavits be withheld from publication in order not to prejudice court proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence contained in the report, some of which provides further corroboration of Goldstone's earlier &quot;Third Force&quot; report, relates inter alia to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Large quantities of arms transported from Namibia to Vlakplaas, and arms delivered by Vlakplaas police to Inkatha in the run-up to the elections.  Implicated are Celani Mtetwa, now KwaZulu/Natal MEC for Justice, and IFP leaders Themba Khoza, Victor Nlovu and James Ndlovu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The bombing of Khotso House and Cosatu House in the late 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Vlakplaas &quot;hit squad&quot; activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Interference in March 1994 by former Vlakplaas operatives and senior serving police officers, with the apparent knowledge of Van der Merwe, with a witness of the Goldstone Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Vlok's knowledge of the bombing of Khotso House and the Namibia arms cache at Vlakplaas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-A network of Inkatha soldiers in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Security police disinformation, torture, and assault. The death of activist Stanza Bopapi would have been the result of police assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-How police practised in a mock-trial to prepare for the inquest of Dr Neil Agget, who died in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The blackmail of a senior clergyman of the South African Council of Churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The near-fatal poisoning of Reverend Frank Chikane in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Operation Romulus, a disinformation campaign to destabilize the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-A relationship between the security police and the Returned Exiles Committee, an organisation ostensibly of former inmates of ANC detention camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-That the Support the Police Action Group was a security police front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Links between the security police and the Confederation of Employers of South Africa (Cofesa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The shredding of about 135 000 security police files after the Inkathagate scandal in mid-1991.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 14, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Reg Rumney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alarm bells have begun to ring for the economic outlook for South Africa.  As the election &quot;miracle&quot; begins to be discounted, doubts about the underlying soundness of the economic structure have begun to mount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not only that economists are by nature pessimists -- not for nothing is economics known as the dismal science. The hugeness of the economic challenge is beginning to become apparent. Lurking problems include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-A mediocre growth rate in a country with an estimated formal unemployment rate of around 43 percent will not even mop up</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-New entrants into the job market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Added to this, the union movement is pushing, in its proposed amendments to the draft Labour Bill, for less flexibility, with more and stricter government regulation of the labour market. Inflexible labour markets are likely to deter new foreign investors and add to South Africa's uncompetitiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Foreign direct investment, at about R800-million last year, has picked up, but is by no means a flood, and is concentrated on buying existing businesses rather than on greenfield projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The glowing export performance of past years has been shown to be less than miraculous, in the light of the ease with which export income has been overtaken by spending on imports, spurred by economic growth. For the second month this year, the trade balance -- exports minus imports -- went R135-million into the red in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-A lack of movement on the delivery of basic needs in terms of the Reconstruction and Development Programme threatens stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-South Africa has found itself in what is arguably a &quot;debt trap&quot;, where money has to be borrowed to pay interest on loans already raised, adding to the debt in a snowball effect. The interest burden of government debt this year is projected to be 18,5 percent of total government spending. Put another way, around R1 out of every R5 of taxpayer's money is spent on servicing the debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Little progress has been made in spelling out government policy on privatisation of State assets, which could be used to run down government debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-A forecast Budget deficit for this fiscal year -- the gap between government revenue and spending, which has to be borrowed -- is beginning to look high at 5,8 percent, after two years of economic recovery. The Department of Finance appears to be looking at a Budget deficit of five percent next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-No obvious progress is discernable in bringing down the high crime rate, which is a deterrent to domestic and foreign investment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weekly Mail and Guardian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 14, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High level approval of police dirty tricks has been revealed in new documents, writes Stefaans BrUmmer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Docyments given to the Mail &amp; Guardian this week provide fresh evidence that police dirty tricks in the run-up to the 1994 elections were sanctioned at the highest level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will increase pressure on former president FW de Klerk to explain what critics charge was his government's &quot;duplicity&quot; in negotiations with the ANC, as revealed by the Mail &amp; Guardian in the last fortnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While former security police operative Paul Erasmus gave new documentary proof that post- 1990 operations against the ANC and its alliance partners were approved at police headquarters, ex-police chief General Johan van der Merwe this week confirmed that two cabinet committees under De Klerk were briefed on covert operations during the post-1990 negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe's assertion, and Erasmus' evidence that operations aimed at destabilising the ANC alliance were part of a well co- ordinated strategy, cast a pall over De Klerk's defence that rogue elements within the security forces, bent on sabotaging his reform initiatives, should bear sole responsibility for post-1990 &quot;dirty tricks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of De Klerk's critics accept he would not have been party to decisions to eliminate opponents and instigate violence -- but doubts remain, on the one hand, about his knowledge of such matters, and on the other hand about his active or tacit approval for &quot;soft&quot; projects against the alliance partners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela is known to believe that De Klerk's government played a duplicitous role during the negotiations that followed Mandela's release from prison in February 1990. &quot;Mandela has always worked on the basis that (De Klerk's government) knew ... Either he was incapable of dealing with the problem, or they (the security forces) were doing what he wanted them to do,&quot; a source close to Mandela said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erasmus' documents include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A signal, dated July 15 1991, from Lieutenant-Colonel Alf Oosthuizen, chief of intelligence at police headquarters in Pretoria, to police Crime Intelligence Service (successor to the Security Branch) branches countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The signal, headed &quot;Romulus: covert ad-hoc action to put pressure on the ANC/SACP&quot;, orders an immediate campaign to &quot;make the SACP a millstone around the neck of the ANC&quot;. Erasmus says Operation Romulus was part of a wider &quot;Project Wigwam&quot; aimed at influencing political tendencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issued shortly after elections for the ANC National Executive Committee, the order asks that the &quot;SACP's influence in the ANC&quot; be pointed out, that the SACP and ANC be &quot;typified as one and the same organisation&quot;, and that &quot;economic policy differences between the ANC and SACP be driven to a head&quot;.  It tells police to &quot;launch the action with all capabilities at your disposal&quot;, but suggests pamphleteering, the use of front organisations, media contact and dissemination by sources, agents and co- operators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-A commendation of Erasmus, dated May 20 1991, from Major-General PJ Viljoen at Crime Intelligence Service headquarters in Pretoria, for &quot;an ad-hoc action launched to attain the aims of Operation Romulus&quot;. It says Erasmus &quot;has with great effort and enthusiasm launched actions which caused a great stir in Britain&quot; and that &quot;it had positive results for the government and will definitely add to the success of later actions which will be launched&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporting documentation makes it clear the &quot;actions&quot; involved the discreditation in Britain of the ANC, among other means by getting at Winnie Mandela. One document refers to &quot;the specific objective of using the Winnie Mandela &quot;saga&quot; to discredit the ANC as a whole&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-A document dated October 24 1990, signed by Oosthuizen on behalf of the head of the Security Branch, about the planning under &quot;Project Jackal&quot; of a &quot;covert Stratcom (strategic communication) operation aimed at radical teachers' associations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document says the ANC-aligned South African Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu), entailed &quot;dangers&quot; including &quot;the broadening of the SACP/ANC power base&quot;. The operation would be co-ordinated by the intelligence section of the Security Branch at Pretoria headquarters and proposed the formation of a &quot;loose umbrella organisation front&quot; to counter Sadtu and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation would be presented to then-Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok for approval in December 1990, the document says. Further documentation shows final implementation plans starting January 1991 for &quot;Operation Tutor&quot;, under &quot;Project Jackal&quot;, which includes plans for the establishment of a teacher body that would be a police front, the infiltration of other teacher organisations and &quot;continuous discreditation actions against Sadtu&quot;. Erasmus says the project was implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-A document setting out the implementation from January 1991 of &quot;Operation Gordian&quot; to influence and &quot;minimalise the effect&quot; of the ANC Youth League and the ANC-aligned South African Youth Congress. It proposes donors be &quot;influenced&quot; to stop or decrease funding &quot;administrative sabotage&quot;, the creation of division within the organisations and the &quot;neutralising and discreditation&quot; of leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- An information note from Oosthuizen to the head of the Security Branch, dated November 8 1990 and bearing what appears to be the signatures of Vlok and General van der Merwe, on a media conference where two Returned Exile Co-ordinating Committee (Recoc) members would &quot;reveal the ANC's undemocratic policy, ethnic divisions in the organisation and the existence of conditions in the Mbarara detention camp in Uganda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The note says that &quot;Recoc as an organisation acts wholly independently, although this office co-ordinates its actions&quot;, and that &quot;the South African Police involvement will in no way be revealed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk acknowledged on Sunday that his former ministers Gerrit Viljoen, Kobie Coetzee and Barend du Plessis had served on a cabinet committee dealing with Stratcom after 1990. &quot;The terms of reference of the committee were not to approve of specific Stratcom projects. It was a mechanism which I created to phase out specific projects which were decided upon in a previous era.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe confirmed the existence of the committee, chaired by Du Plessis. &quot;The committee was supposed to report fully to the former state president, Mr De Klerk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said another cabinet body, the Security Information Committee, was headed by Coetzee. It co-ordinated &quot;all security matters&quot; and &quot;especially a person like Mr Kobie Coetzee ... was completely informed of what was happening on ground level&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe said De Klerk &quot;had the view that no Stratcom project should be to the detriment of a political party. It should, however, be kept in mind that we were dealing with an extremely complicated political and security situation.&quot; The ANC's own Operation Vula showed the ANC had &quot;not been honest&quot; in its actions after 1990 &quot;and that there were forces at work which clashed with the spirit of the negotiations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A noted public figure who had contact with De Klerk after 1990 this week said his impression was that De Klerk had had little grip on covert security structures when he inherited them from PW Botha. &quot;Later I got the impression he knew what was going on, but that he was not really doing anything about it. Watergate-type destabilisation he did not really think was a problem...  FW, as things moved along, realised more, but did less.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Stefaans Brummer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More allegations linking Winnie Mandela to the 1989 murder of teenage activist Stompie Seipei and other crimes emerged this week as she prepared to sue former President FW de Klerk for a police discreditation campaign against her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trainer of the controversial Mandela Football Club, Jerry Richardson, jailed in 1990 for the murder of 14- year-old Seipei, has reportedly spoken out in jail for a second time, claiming Mandela ordered the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Xoliswa Falati, estranged friend of Mandela, allegedly claimed she had taken the rap for Mandela in their 1991 trial for the kidnap and assault of Seipei, where Mandela was sentenced to a R15 000 fine on appeal. Mandela failed in an interdict attempt in June last year to gag Falati from speaking out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both allegations were published this week in the Dutch news journal Nieuwe Revu, days after the Afrikaans Sunday paper Rapport said that Richardson had claimed from Leeuwkop Prison that &quot;a person&quot; had given him the fatal order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mandela, fired as a deputy minister by her estranged husband President Nelson Mandela earlier this year, and ANC MP Peter Mokaba are planning to sue Deputy President FW de Klerk for a police smear campaign against them after 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of the campaign, which Mandela is understood to blame for her fall from grace and the break-down of her marriage, were first published by the Mail &amp; Guardian three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, based on confessions and documentation provided by former security police operative Paul Erasmus, detailed a 1991 operation, sanctioned at security police headquarters in Pretoria, to publicise in the international media &quot;abuses&quot; of the Mandela Football Club and allegations of Mandela's marital infidelity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former police commissioner General Johan van der Merwe subsequently said De Klerk's cabinet had full knowledge of covert police operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erasmus said information fed to the media was partly true, partly distortion. The extent of the distortion remains unexplained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nieuwe Revu journalist Helene Schilders said in her article that she visited Richardson in Leeuwkop Prison, where he told her: &quot;I called her 'mommy'. I wanted to do everything for her. That is why I gave her a cover. I would still protect her if she had shown interest in me, but now I feel used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Soon I will be going to the Truth Commission. Then I will tell what really happened. Perhaps I will get amnesty ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I murdered Stompie. But during the trial I said that it was my own initiative, while in truth it had been an order of Winnie's. She heard from an important ANC member that he was an informer. She was always extremely scared of spies ... Stompie was detained in the house of Winnie. Everyone who entered used him as a boxing ball, Winnie too. He was already in a bad way when I took him to a field to murder him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richardson also claimed, according to the article, that on Mandela's orders he had stabbed another member of the football club &quot;who had wanted to inform the secret police&quot; and that he had petrol bombed houses of &quot;people who did not want their children to go with the football team&quot;. The football team member survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journal quoted Falati as saying: &quot;During the (1991) court case, I took the responsibility for the abuse of Stompie and the other youths on me. That was an order of Winnie and her daughter Zindzi. Otherwise, something would have happened to me. Winnie did not ask, she ordered. She never thanked me.  She would have had my house restored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falati and Richardson's new evidence is bound to pour cold water on a Department of Correctional Services statement this week that it had a sworn affidavit from Richardson that he had told the Rapport journalist no more than that he was prepared to testify to the Truth Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have confirmed that they are investigating several unsolved crimes in connection with the Mandela Football Club and that detectives have travelled to London to interview British MP Emma Nicholson, who has claimed to have tape recordings of confessions by Katiza Cebekhulu, a member of the football team who was spirited away to Zambia before he could testify in Mandela's 1991 trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela refused to respond to Mail &amp; Guardian inquiries this week. Mokaba, widely regarded as her political ally, said: &quot;I will not speak on behalf of Winnie. I believe we all need to stand up to what we did. There has to be a mechanism to investigate such allegations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokaba confirmed he and Mandela had met with their lawyer and Erasmus earlier this month with a view to instituting civil action against De Klerk for damages arising from police discreditation campaigns against them. He argued the Truth Commission would not have the &quot;teeth&quot; to expose the full truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think we should simply punish the footsoldiers -- but the commanders. We want to protect the Government of National Unity, but it cannot be protected with lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;We are certainly going ahead (with a civil suit) to expose everything. The legal route is better because it has teeth. At the Truth Commission, people must volunteer information.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Julian Drew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHRIS BALL believes the 2004 Olympic Games &quot;is quite simply the biggest economic opportunity that South Africa will ever have&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is for this reason that he decided to apply for the position of CEO of the Bid Company. Ball, former chief executive of First National Bank, likes to talk about the economic multiplier effects of the Olympic Games. &quot;In terms of the Olympic Games, the pre-multipliers are real and particularly clear in terms of South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Games would change the view of the world towards South Africa. It would be a technical award made to South Africa which would say that the world believes we can in fact stage the Games. This in itself would produce direct foreign investment in South Africa and change the level of confidence in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then you would get a very dramatic increase in tourism from the time we start bidding for the Games. This would increase significantly when the Games are awarded. So the return on investment expenditure, on a national basis, is extremely high and there is every justification for saying that the expenditure should in fact be made,&quot; says Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Ball's fiscal background may lead him to stress the economic benefits of staging the Games, he is acutely aware that they are not the only ones. &quot;You can take a broad view of the Olympics which is what the President has done. President Mandela thinks the impact of the Games will be substantial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like to use the term transformational because the Games will impact on attitudes; they will assist the process of nation building; they will change the view of the world towards South Africa and they will have a major economic impact,&quot; he claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bad publicity caused by all the infighting over the bid earlier this year is now behind us, Ball believes, and since his appointment he has concentrated on getting the right team together to get the process on track again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we've done in the last two weeks is to refocus the bid. We have the beginnings of a strategic concept that now needs to be agreed to by the constituents, including the board of directors. We have a budget for the Bid Company which will be published in about a week's time as soon as it is approved by the board. We have a management team in place. We have shifted the physical identity of the bid by redesigning the bid logo and we have set in motion the planning process. So there has been a significant amount of activity in this period,&quot; says Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the new logo cannot be published yet, it gives the bid a stronger African identity as opposed to the previous logo which focused on Cape Town through its depiction of Table Mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question which begs to be answered, however, is whether we now have sufficient time left to put together a winning technical proposal by the August 15 deadline next year after losing six months earlier this year. &quot;I think we can still meet the deadlines, but the main thing is that we must put forward a pragmatic proposal,&quot; says Ball</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It must be a very practical Games with practical facilities which are going to be used thereafter. It is on that basis that we are putting the proposal together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Interim Bid Committee, which employed private consultants to do the planning work, did a lot of groundwork and that is now being reviewed by the new team. &quot;The work that's been done so far is conceptual rather than detailed engineering. There has been a benefit from what has already taken place but all of it has had to be reviewed. What we will produce is a new plan but naturally it is based on an awareness of the previous work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the problems with the previous concept is that it was done without reference to the council and the council has to approve the plan. There will be a fresh plan with council people involved which will be fully costed and we are doing that work as quickly as we can,&quot; revealed Ball. One hundred and fifty Western Cape organisations have been invited to a conference taking place this weekend in Cape Town to discuss the concept of the Olympics and the process that will be followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ball sees the immediate targets for the Bid Company as raising the money for the bid, completing and costing the new plan, carrying out the economic impact study of the Games on South Africa as a whole, liaising with the international federations to ensure that they are up to date with all the latest requirements and communicating with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) members in preparation for the actual bidding process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the budget for the bid should be ready in about a week and the strategic plan in about a month, the Bid Company aims to have the new technical plan and the economic impact study available in three months' time which, as Ball says,&quot;is a big, big exercise&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ball is extremely optimistic about Cape Town's prospects of winning the bid. &quot;We have four very strong elements out of which to build a platform to launch our bid. Cape Town's physical environment is the key but we also have the present goodwill towards South Africa personified by President Mandela's standing in the world. Then there is the African factor which is very important because Africans have nearly 20 percent of the IOC votes, and finally there is the development factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I actually believe that Cape Town could put on simply the most enjoyable Olympic Games imaginable and with the natural environment of the Western Cape I can't think of anywhere else in the world where people could have more fun,&quot; says Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is certainly a very strong case in favour of Cape Town but one of the first tasks now will be to reconvince a rather disillusioned local populace who have been fed an unhealthy diet of selective disinformation over the past six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the &quot;big, big exercise&quot; to get to grips with and, finally, the small matter of convincing the IOC's 106 members that Cape Town is the place they would best like to spend a three-week vacation in nine years' time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Reg Rumney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1990 and 1994 the income of squatters in Gauteng declined in real, or adjusted-for-inflation, terms while that of hostel residents stayed much the same and those living in houses were much better off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the finding of a Unisa Bureau of Market Research report on income and spending of black households in Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Squatter households were 11,7 percent worse off in 1994 than in 1990; hostel residents' incomes rose 1,6 percent; and households in houses were 35,3 percent better off - all in real terms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say blacks living in houses are exactly wealthy. In 1994, the average black man and woman earned R21 555 and R20 884 respectively. The average black household had an income of R24 416.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the BMR reckons the average income of a black person in Gauteng was R7 455 -- around R720 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Single black people, however, are estimated to have on average a much higher annual income, of R16 220. For households with with six or more members the the income per person is R3 651.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The income per person in households with six or more members living in houses is lower at R4 079 than that of households with three members living in squatter shacks, at R5 132.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disparities of wealth are large even among blacks in the richest South African province. The survey shows that in 1994 annual the household income of squatters was around R14 000. This is less than half the income of households living in houses, of around R32 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black households in Gauteng, according to the BMR, spent 26,1 percent of the cash income on food. Income tax made up 9,1 percent, and housing 9,0 percent of their cash spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shack-dwellers spent 37,1 percent of their total spending in cash and kind on food, compared with 28,9 percent for hostel dwellers, and 23,6 percent for those living in houses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Karen Harverson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa will not accept foreign aid unless it can afford to finance the follow-through infrastructure or it will end up like the rest of Africa -- full of half- built hospitals and unfinished roads, said Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a recent business breakfast, Liebenberg said South Africa had a reputation for being difficult when it came to accepting foreign aid. &quot;Donors often insist that aid is used to build something like a hospital or township but forget that the government is left to put in the infrastucture and maintenance which puts a tremendous strain on the Budget which is struggling to meet basic needs.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the government will spend six times more on interest payments this year than it will on the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ninety-one percent of government income is spent on salaries, paying interest and welfare payments with a mere nine percent left for everything else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides meeting the demand for basic needs within fiscal constraints, South Africa needs to increase its growth levels, improve its savings rate, become more investor friendly and improve its competitiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on business to stop waiting for the economic miracle to happen and work with the government to maintain fiscal discipline and encourage growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need a savings rate of 22 percent for the economy to grow 3,5 percent but while private sector savings are already at this rate, government dissaves by 4,5 percent leaving a dismal rate of 17,5 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liebenberg said that although the quickest way to increase the savings rate was to contain government spending -- positive savings from the government would only be a reality by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the meantime, we could use other people's savings to improve the growth rate to five percent which is why we must become investor friendly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said South Africa had to identify its pockets of competitiveness and create opportunities and put in infrastructure to grow these further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our lack of competitiveness is due to structural, environmental, skills and attitude factors. Something is drastically wrong when it costs a company exporting to Tokyo more to rail goods from Johannesburg to Durban than the sea freight there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Leon Perlman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Post and Telecommunications Minister Pallo Jordan's nyet to allowing competition with state telecommunications monopoly Telkom, insiders say it's now not a matter of whether, but rather when and how much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recently released Green Paper on Telecommunications is the initial step to formulating a White Paper on telecommunications policy and eventual legislation, which is expected to go through Parliament early in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is designed to elicit the public's views on the best policy framework for telecommunications and its regulation, and so asks more questions than it answers. Jordan, however, provided some answers when he released the Green Paper at the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comment that, &quot;it is not in the national interest to bring competition against Telkom,&quot; at first seemed slightly out of sync with international trends and even with his own Green Paper which states: &quot;Competition in the telecommunications sector can bring costs down and hence prices to customers.  New operators can bring additional investment into the sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan seemed to be warning off United States Telecommunications giant AT&amp;T, which is eager to be that &quot;new operator&quot;. &quot;AT&amp;T and other international competitors will be cherry-picking. There will be no Telkom left. It will be subversive to the interests of the country, so I will not even think about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers believe Jordan is being pressured by elements within the African National Congress and the South African Communist Party to keep Telkom's monopoly intact. &quot;Telkom is the collective property of the people of the country. We must involve the millions of South Africans who are its principal beneficiaries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparently bemused head of AT&amp;T South Africa, Frank Coleman, who was in the audience while Jordan expressed his forebodings, responded by saying: &quot;You give us far more credit than we deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is too modest. AT&amp;T is a major player in the Southern African telecommunications sector. It is the progenitor of the Africa ONE initiative to ring the African continent with a high-capacity, fibre-optic cable.  Observers believe AT&amp;T is poised to clinch the major portion of the R6-billion &quot;MegaLine&quot; tender to supply some one million new lines to (mainly) rural areas. That puts Jordan's comments into context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insiders say Jordan's caveat about the &quot;danger of competition&quot; is directed more at concerns about the degree of the direct competition for Telkom's fixed- line service, than a categorical dismissal of the possibility of any competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before a formal decision on the equity of Telkom can be made, the objectives and visions that will emerge from public and parliamentary discussion on the Green Paper will have to be studied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan gave the assurance that competition would be welcomed once telecommunications were accessible to all South Africans. With the MegaLine initiative promising to do just that, the long-awaited competition for Telkom could be here sooner than some would like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comment and proposals about the Green Paper must be made in writing by September 15. Jordan will hold a live Internet discussion, via the Internet Relay Chat facility, on the Green Paper on August 15.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Karen Harverson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's gold mines, plagued by low productivity, labour unrest and diminishing cost competitiveness, faced their worst year in 1994 with production dropping below 600 tons for the first time since 1958.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, production seems unlikely to improve, with a fall of nine percent recorded in the first quarter of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Production in the second quarter may prove even worse if the recently released June quarterly results of Gold Fields of South Africa (GFSA) and Gencor are anything to go by: both companies recorded losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GFSA's gold production dropped 9,2 percent in the June quarter, compared to the first quarter of this year, while Gencor reported a 2,5 percent drop in total gold production for the June quarter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, Anglovaal minerals division's (Avmin) quarterly results, released this week, show a one percent rise in gold production, owing to a good performance from Eastern Transvaal Consolidated Mines' Loraine Gold Mine, which boasted a profit for the first time since the first quarter of last year. However, Avmin's main gold producer, Hartebeestfontein, disappointed, with production falling 143 kilograms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decline in gold production this quarter has been attributed to the increased number of public holidays - - six this quarter compared to three in the first quarter -- lowered productivity linked to labour unrest, and deteriorating cost competitiveness as mining depths increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mintek president Dr Aiden Edwards predicts that within five years as many as a third of South Africa's gold mines will close. &quot;The only way to remain profitable is to work the high-grade deposits only, which will shorten the life of a mine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gencor, the fourth largest gold producer in the world, is looking at other African countries and abroad for future growth in gold mining, even though the Witwatersrand Basin still holds more than 40 percent of the world's reserves of gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Gencor chairman Brian Gilbertson said its gold division, Gengold, had failed to match the progress and growth seen in the group's other businesses. &quot;Our production, mirroring that of other South African producers, is in decline, from 85 tons in 1990 to 68 tons this year to a forecast 65 tons in 2000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the company, through its Billiton acquisition, was broadening its horizons to include different types of gold deposits elsewhere in the world, mainly smaller, shallower and easier to mine deposits in Turkey, South America, Ghana and Indonesia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the local front, in a bid to increase the competitiveness of its 10 gold mines, Gencor has decided to free them to operate more independently than they have under the traditional mining-house hierarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mine managers will now be responsible for restructuring operations. The restructuring will include continuous work, extended shifts at the mine face, multi-skilling, and productivity-based pay, to increase competitiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Avmin, while not involved in gold operations abroad, is developing its copper operations with grass roots exploration projects in Zambia and Namibia. Locally, the company is investigating setting up a R400-million greenfields underground coal project in the Eastern Transvaal coalfields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Avmin is also involved in a nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum exploration project near Slaaihoek in the Eastern Transvaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglo American already operates two gold mines outside of the country, Navachab in Namibia and Sadiola Hill in Mali. Sadiola, which is due to come into production in 1997, is expected to become an important contributor to Anglo's earnings in the medium term. The company is also prospecting for gold in Botwana, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger, Ghana, Burkino Faso, Tanzania and Kenya. It spent R150-million on prospecting for the year ended March 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JCI is pursuing mineral investment opportunities in several African countries including gold exploration and mine development activities in Ghana. The company has embarked on a substantial exploration programme on a variety of gold prospects in Tanzania and Swaziland. It recently entered into a joint venture with Ashanti Goldfields for the redevelopment of the Kalana gold mine in Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We anticipate a minor fall in the output of group gold mines which will be compensated for by increasing production outside of South Africa,&quot; says corporate affairs manager Marc Gonsalves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds that the recently opened South Deep complex at Western Areas Gold Mine, which has the largest mineable gold ore reserves in the world, will substantially boost production. It is expected to be on stream by 2000 with a lifespan of more than 40 years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - The 18th Summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) opens here on Friday against the background of dismal economic performance of the sub-region and apathy of its leaders towards integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-day meeting, which is expected to be attended by all 16 Heads of State, coincides with the 20th birthday of ECOWAS which was formed in 1975 amidst high hopes of building a strong economic sub-regional grouping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am sure that we would be the first to admit that this is not a 20th anniversary that we can celebrate with a flourish of trumpets&quot;, said Kwesi Botchwey, outgoing minister of finance, in a speech at 37th session of the Council of Ministers in Accra on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the contrary, &quot;it is time for sober reflection, and a candid assessment of the impact the ECOWAS on the integration of the sub-region and, more importantly, the economic development of member states&quot;, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sub-region has been plagued by natural and man-made disasters which have had serious adverse effects on the economies of the various countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Botchwey the overall econmic performance in the sub-region over the past one-and-a-half decades has been &quot;disappointing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real gross domestic product (GDP) for the sub-region averaged 2.5 per cent a year during 1986-94 which is well below the average population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Per capita real GDP declined further, even though at a slower rate than the rate of decline in the 1980-85 period&quot;, the Ghanaian minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report for 1994-95, the Executive Secretary of ECOWAS Edouard Benjamin also painted a bleak picture of the sub-regional grouping saying that its economic performance for 1994 was &quot;generally poor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was notable reduction in economic activity within the region as a whole despite the relatively favourable condition in the UEMOA (West African Monetary Union) countries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributed this to the considerable fall in production in Nigeria, the sub-regiona's economic giant which contributes 55 per cent to the region's GDP, and the protracted civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other growth-inhibiting factor in West Africa, according to Benjamin, included the inadequate reforms undertaken in some countries, the difficulty in mobilising external resources in an increasingly competitive world environment and the inability of the region to strenghten its competitive position on the goods and services market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Growth prospects in the region remain dependent on internal political factors as well as extraneous factors such as climate, prices of raw materials and the demands for goods exported by member states&quot;. Also, Benjamin was not happy about the slow pace of integration which he blamed on lack of commitment of member states. &quot;The lethargy that has descended on the community is in sharp contract to the enthusiastic support worldwide that regional cooperation continues to enjoy...&quot; he said. Citing instances, Benjamin said one year after the Abuja Summit that took &quot;a number of positive decisions at both the council and authority levels&quot;, very little improvement has been recorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revised ecowas treaty has still not entered into force for lack of the requited number of ratifications, he said. He said there has been no significant improvement in the rate of application by member states of community acts and decisions, and the community institutions have not been able to implement the approved work programme for lack of resources.  According to Benjamin, there has been &quot;near total paralysis&quot;, of operations of the community institutions because financial contributions from member states &quot;have been a mere trickle during these first six months of the year&quot;.  The community has witnessed considerable lack of commitment and determination to implement ECOWAS integration programmes&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The performance of the institutions of the community has been seriously affected by a president cash-flow situation. However, Benjamin points out that growth in West Africa in 1995 and the ensuing years will remain contingent upon a number of factors, such as the world economic growth rate, the evolution of commodity prices and financial flows. Endonenous factors which will influence the regional environment, and particularly the growth prospects... will include the adoption and continuation of economic reforms, increase in the rate and viability of investments, alleviation of domestic political crises and consolidation of the regional integration process. As Botchwey told his colleagues, it is important to identify and discuss reasons for the limited impact of ECOWAS on the life of the ordinary citizen and on the West African business community as a whole. Benjamin calls for the involvement of all functionaries at the different echelons of government, raising of regional integration to the top of the national agenda and elimination of duplication in the regional integration arrangements.  Protocols and conventions should be ratified, the national capacity for implementing and monitoring community acts and decisions must be strengthened and outstanding contributions settled. Twenty years after the establishment of ECOWAS, the will and desire for the regional grouping to succeed is absent because neither a true assessment of the regional integration option has been made at the national level nor a serious attempt made to exploit the potential on a sustained basis, noted Benjamin. He added that out of such an assessment would emerge the true worth if regional integration and the urge to give it serious consideration. &quot;It is only when the relevance of the community has been determined would member states develop the will to support it&quot;, he added.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The Zambian government says it is renaming the country's main university, the airport and air services institute after three of the country's departed personalities in recognition of their contribution to the development of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released Wednesday, Zambia's Information and Broadcasting Services Minister, Amusaa Mwanamwambwa said the University of Zambia in Lusaka will be renamed 'Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula University', in remembrance of the man widely acknowledged as the 'father of Zambian Nationalism'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkumbula was the leader of the African National Congress (ANC) in what was then called Northern Rhodesia, the first nationalist movement to spearhead the country's campaign against British colonial rule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later became the first African Minister of Education in 1962 in a nationalist coalition government of the ANC and the break-away United National Independence Party (UNIP) of Kenneth Kaunda who was the ANC's general secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from his contribution to the independence movement, Nkumbula is also credited with laying the foundation of democracy in Zambia. He died in October 1983 at the age of 67.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka airport will henceforth be known as 'Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport', in honour of kapwepwe, another veteran nationalist and one-time Vice-President of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air services institute will become 'Valentine Shula Musakanya Air Services Training Institute' in remembrance of Musakanya, a former minister who set it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musakanya, as Minister of State for Technical Education, soon after independence in 1964, was instrumental in establishing the institute for the training of local commercial pilots. The institute has since been turned into a Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) regional training centre for pilots and other aviation staff.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwean Intelligence Chief Elleck Mashingaidze allegedly leaked information, later proved false, about a secret wedding between President Robert Mugabe and one of his secretaries, a Magistrate's Court was told here on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trevor Ncube, editor of the independent weekly Financial Gazette, denying criminal defamation charges arising from the publication of the story, told the court that he did not doubt the veracity of the story because the informant was a high-ranking senior government official who had talked to his deputy, Simbarashe Makunike, who wrote the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncube is jointly charged with Makunike and Modus publications Chief Executive and Publisher of the Financial Gazette, Elias Rusike, on two counts of criminal defamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges arise from complaints by High Court Judge Paddington Garwe and Minister of Public Construction and National Housing, Enos Chikowore, following published articles which purported that they were at Mugabe's alleged secret wedding to Grace Marufu during the Easter weekend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Financial Gazette later retracted the story and apologised to the two but after writing two other stories in which had insisted that the wedding took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncube, who, along with Rusike, is mounting a defence separate from that of Makunike because of differences in approach to the case, denied during his evidence in chief and under cross examination suggestions that by repeatedly publishing the story without official confirmation or proof, he was reckless and unprofessional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Led by advocate Erik Morris, instructed by Innocent Chagonda of 'Atherstone and Cook', Ncube also said that there was nothing unethical about revealing an informant (the Intelligence Chief) who had made &quot;deliberate efforts to mislead&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under cross examination from Makunike's lawyer, Jonathan Muganhu of 'Gollop and Blank', Ncube said Makunike had told him he was related to Mashingaidze and that they had met at a family function where the intelligence officer talked about attending Mugabe's wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makunike, Ncube said, had gone to write the story and allegedly got an undertaking from Mashingaidze that copies of the marriage certificate would be supplied in a &quot;khakhi envelope&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was my right hand man. I had no reason to doubt him. All I did was to tell him to verify certain facts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Garwe and Chikowore could not be reached immediately, makunike had allegedly verified the story with one Clive Broe, a British expatriate working at the justice ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Ms Bambi Hammond of the Attorney-General's office as to whay why Ncube had not confirmed the wedding with Ms Marufu before publishing the story, the journalist said that had not occurred to him at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most important thing was that the source, who was a relative (of Makunike) was at the wedding...it didn't occur to me that she (Marufu) was a key person at the ceremony,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On why he had not contacted the president to confirm the information, Ncube said efforts were made to contact his office but officials had referred him to direct his question to the president himself or his relatives on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For your own information its difficult to get anything from the president's office. It would have taken years...you can't reach the president directly. You go through officials and we did that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On why he had not contacted Marufu's relatives, Ncube said there was no need to go that far, saying &quot;who would doubt the Director-General of the CIO (Central Intelligence Organisation) when he says he was at the wedding&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Hammond suggested to Ncube that he had been reckless to the extreme by publishing a story without any proof, Ncube replied: &quot;it's your opinion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On why he had not retracted the story after Mugabe, Garwe and Chikowore had denied that the ceremony took place, Ncube said at the time he had no reason to doubt Makunike and his source and denials by public officials were &quot;normal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he suspected the denials were because of the circumstances surrounding the marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to elaborate, he said the story was that Mugabe had married his former secretary and already had two children with her, one of whom was born while the former first lady, Sally Mugabe, was still alive. Sally Mugabe died on january 27, 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said he believed the denials could have been to discredit the financial gazette because Mugabe and other senior government officials had expressed discomfort with the existence of the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, senior magistrate William Cutler, turned down Makunike's application for a separate trial and change of plea to that of guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cutler turned down the application on procedural grounds, noting especially that the application was made after the state had closed its case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - The Third Presidential Forum on Science and Technology end here Tuesday with a communique which recognised that &quot;basic food and nutritional security has become the priority in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The basic food and nutritional security crisis in africa cannot be addressed in isolation from the poverty problem,&quot; said the document, read out by former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking before the two-day meeting closed in the Ugandan capital, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe called for enhanced scientific research in Africa to ensure adequate production of nutritious food.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said scientific research, particularly in drought-stricken southern Africa, should emphasise on producing early maturing crop varieties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe urged scientists in the region, where there were weather fluctuations characterised by periodic droughts, to develop varieties of crops which could mature in at least two months in order to offset food shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He regretted the fact that agricultural research tended to benefit the commercial sector at the expense of other agricultural sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Research for its own sake is not that useful. it must benefit all,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe also called on african governments to tackle the drought problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes we can pray to the almighty and traditionalists can play their part.  But we must do something as nations to conserve water,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said water was not being adequately conserved to the extent that it &quot;just flows into the oceans&quot;, adding that Zimbabwe had adopted the building of dams as a major priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the same occasion, Malawi's President Bakili Muluzi supported mugabe's call to conserve water in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He acknowledged that water was available but should be used more efficiently, for instance in irrigation projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe was expected back home on Tuesday evening.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The 160 grave-diggers and other workers at Maputo's main cemetery called off a strike they had planned to start Tuesday, for fear of repression by the Mozambican police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers' demands to the Maputo City Council include a revision of their wage structure, overtime pay, danger money, length of service bonuses and free medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the cemetery workers' ad-hoc commission met on Monday with Maputo mayor Joao Baptista Cosme, he reportedly threatened to send riot police against them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview Tuesday, Carlos Matsinhe, a member of the ad-hoc commission, told the Mozambique News Agency (AIM) that when this was reported back to the workers this morning, they decided not to push ahead with the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not stopping work because we're afraid of being beaten by the police' , said Matsinhe. &quot;The mayor threatened to use a police unio against us. We're afraid of being jailed, so we're resuming work unsatisfied&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cosme said he wouldn't recognise our strike because the law forbids strikes in essential services' , added Matsinhe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1990 Mozambican law says strikes are permitted in essential services, provided the strikers allow a basic minimum of work to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosme reportedly also claimed that the cemetery workers are not recognised as civil servants by the ministry of state administration. this is presumably why they are treated as casual labour, with each of them receiving the same pay packet of 215,000 meticais (about 23 US dollars compared with the minimum wage of 16 US dollars) a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matsinme said the workers would now appeal to Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that the strike has only been postponed.If the problems were not addressed, &quot;sooner or later we'll go on strike, and if we have to die, then we'll die&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burials were continuing as usual this morning, while Cosme refused to speak to journalists about the matter</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PORT-LOUIS, Mauritius (PANA) - Kenya has since Monday been holding a business week in Port-Louis, Mauritius, as a way of boosting trade exchanges between the two member states of the 23-nation Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the event,Kenya hopes to improve its balance of trade with Mauritius, currently in favour of the Indian ocean island state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, Kenyan exports to Mauritius amounted to 12.6 million US dollars compared with imported goods worth 3.4 US dollars brought into Port Louis from the East African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cement represents 76 per cent of Kenyan exports to Mauritius which plans to hold a reciprocal business week in Nairobi soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the Kenyan business week Monday, the Mauritian Industry and Tourism Minister, Nde Ah Qwet Lee Chong Lem, said his country was attracted by the liberalisted African export market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mauritius and Kenya were also exploring possibilities of promoting themselves abroad as joint tourist destinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Kenya's trade and industry minister, Kirugi M'Mkindia, invited Mauritian businessmen to take advantage of the political and social stability prevailing in his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refered to Nairobi's favourable conditions for foreign investors, particularly in terms of infrastructure and fiscal policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 10 Kenyan businesspeople are participating in the promotion week in Mauritian capital, where they are exhibiting products like detergents, textiles, leather products, biscuits, handicrafts, cooking ustensils, rubber and plastics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Developing countries need to use foreign aid to build strong economies and develop the necessary skilled manpower to sustain development after aid money dies up, Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza said Monday in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening a three-day seminar on ' Effective Aid Management in Commonwealth African Region,' Penza said that while it was true that foreign aid tended to create a dependency syndrome among recepient developing countries, it was possible to utilise the aid to attain the capacity to support self-development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With specific reference to Zambia, Penza said that the country needed foreign aid to strengthen key economic institutions and enable Zambians acquire skills needed to manage a sophisticated and competitive economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's external debt currently stands at 7.3 billion US dollars. The Minister said Zambia needed more foreign funds to restructure the economy and lay the foundation for future growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics blame foreign aid for increasing dependency by recepients on the donors, distortion of developing economies and failure to effectively reduce poverty, among other disadvantages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen Commonwealth African countries are attending the Lusaka meeting which will discuss, among other subjects, ' disbursement of aid and links between aid management and public expenditure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA Ghana (PANA) - Ghana's foreign debt at the end of last year stood at five billion dollars, up seven per cent on the 1993 figure, the Institue of Economic Affairs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a publication entitled ' Economic Review and Outlook' released at the week-end, the Institue regarded at the nations's think-tank on economic and development issues, said Ghana currently spends 30 per cent of its earnings on debt servicing per year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the increase in the debt stock was a result of persistent balance of payment deficits and too much reliance on foreign support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West African State has received billions of dollars from bilateral and multilateral donors in support of its economic recovery programme launched in 1983. The Institute said in view if the increasing debt, the country must free itself from external support and prevent the situation from degenerating into severe economic hardships when the external inflows cease or are sharply reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document said domestic debt went up by 12.3 per cent to 531.1 billion Cedis (1,116 Cedis = 1 USD) in the past year. It said the high levels of the domestic debt stock and high cost of borrowing have resulted in high interest payments on domestic debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana, constantly held up for admiration by the International Monetary Fund and the World bank as an example of the success of Structural adjustment programmes, recorded 3.8 per cent economic growth last year, the worst performance since 1990.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently, interest rates were hovering around 33 percent, with the annualised inflation rate marginally tumbling 0.1 percentage points in May to 19.9 percent as of June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A downsurge in interest rates to the low twenties or teens - with a more downtrend potential - would be the major trigger for a sustained stockmarket performance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, he noted, would be more preferable to songs and poems portraying her beauty, dignity and wisdom. &quot;I am fairly sure that the average African woman would rather see some modest practical changes which would relieve her hardships and involve her in decision making than to hear a dozen fine poems about the &quot;tears of mother africa&quot;, he stressed. President Rawlings said this when he opened the Accra consultative meeting, called to polish unresolved issues in the African Platform for Action (PFA) to be presented at the Fourth World Conference on Women, taking place in Beijing, China in September.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document was originally produced at the November 1994 Regional Women's Conference in Dakar, Senegal but the adoption of certain clauses fuelled some ill feelings from certain quarters. The meeting, which will also consider the formation of a lobby group to work towards the inclusion of common positions in the PFA, is being attended by 50 participants from Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia,Ghana, Kenya,Liberia, Namibia,Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. President Rawlings said one of the greatest inequalities on the African continent is unequal access to education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Education is the key to the future, and as long as our cultural attitudes deprive girls of equal opportunities for education and self-development, we will not see the full potential of our nations, our continent and the world, &quot;he added. Even in those African countries where approximately equal numbers of boys and girls begin primary education, he said, the proportion of girls steadily declines through secondary and tertiary education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To address this problem, Rawlings said, Ghana's ministry of education targetted some rural areas with an exceptionally high rate of female school drop outs for a pilot scheme in which school girls were provided with notebooks, pen, pencils and other very elementary needs. The result made a remarkable improvement in the rate of girls completing their courses, out of all proportion to the small assistance given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This challenges our use of the word drop out. We borrowed this word from the west where it implies a voluntary action. Our girls do not voluntarily drop out of school. They are either withdrawn by parents and pushed into work or marriage, or are trapped by pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It also shows that for parents living close to the poverty line, even the minimal expenses required to keep a girl in attendance at our tuition-free state schools present a serious difficulty to the household,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Paul Fauvet, PANA Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The Central Committee of Mozambique's ruling FRELIMO has appointed Manuel Tome as the Party's General Secretary, only second to President Joaquim Chissano. In a major shake-up announced early Monday morning, the committee completely reshuffled its executive body, the Secretariat, removing five out of the six old members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued at the end of the committee's seven-day meeting at dawn Monday, showed that the only surviving member is Tome, who was promoted from the post of Secretary for Mobilisation and Propaganda. He replaced Feliciano Gundana, a veteran of the independence struggle, and one of the first FRELIMO guerrillas who received military training in algeria in the early 1960s, to combat Portuguese colonialism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tome, 42, is a journalist by profession, who has held the jobs of Chief News Editor on the daily paper ' Noticias' , General Secretary of the Mozambican Journalists' Union, and General Director of Radio Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five new members were elected to the Secretariat. They are the former governors of Tete and Niassa provinces, Cadmiel Muthemba and Julio N'chola, Laurinda Kanji, who used to manage a major state-owned engineering factory in Maputo, Veronica Macamo and Alcindo Cumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others off the Secretariat are the former secretaries for organisation, Rosario Lumbela, for administration and finance, Eduardo Arao, for foreign relations, Alberto Sithole, and for manpower and training, Guidion N'dobe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There had been criticism that ths secretariat under Gundana had lacked dynamism and had been conservative in its approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tome told a press conference this morning that on Saturday, to facilitate the committee's work, the entire secretariat had resigned en bloc, putting their positions at the committee's disposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Frelimo Central committee has set up a working group, led by Political Mommittee member and former Information Minister Rafael Maguni, to present, within 60 days, a proposal for restructuring the rest of the party apparatus which has 3,000 employees. The committee also decided to postpone the Seventh FRELIMO congress, due to be held next year, to 1997 so as to allow the party to concentrate on the local elections scheduled for 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main debate over these elections is whether they should take place in the entire country, as the former rebel movement RENAMO, now the country's second major party, demands, or just in a few of its 23 cities and 128 districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central committee said it had looked at the possibility of nationwide elections and had decided against. It recommended instead that the elections should be held gradually, as the administrative system is restructured, and as the necessary staff are trained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given FRELIMO'ss parliamentary majority, this is virtually certain to be the position that the assembly of the republic will adopt when it votes on local election law later this year. It means that the 1996 elections will only be held in those places which have already been designated as municipal districts. Currently there are just 11 of these - maputo and the other ten provincial capitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time of the elections, several other places that already have a functioning administration, and where there is sufficient economic activity to generate a local tax base, could also be upgraded into municipal districts. But large swathes of the war-devastated countryside will clearly not attain this status within the next 12 months. Mozambique gained independence from Portugal on 25 June 1975. A year later,rebels calling themselves RENAMO funded by the white minority administration in neigbouring Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) launched a disastrous war that only ended with the signing of a peace agreement in Rome in October 1992.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - African leaders Tuesday ended a two-day forum in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, with a commitment to pursue a 10-year multi-sectoral programme of action to achieve food and nutritional security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents Ketumile Masire of Botswana, Burundi's Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, Malawi's President Bakili Muluzi, Mozambique's Joachim Chissano, President Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, were here to attend the Third Presidential Forum on the Management of Science and Technology in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a communique issued at the end of the forum, the leaders appealed to African policy organs to translate policies into pragmatic actions to promote the sectors that support food production.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They cited seed industry, recapitalisation of African soils through phosphate fertilisation, environmentally friendly pest and disease management, and the fostering of a robust intra-african network of food markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders said basic food and nutritional security has become the priority of priorities in Africa.&quot;It is not only a question of Africa's self-worth and political prudence, it is now a question of Africa's very survival.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communique said &quot;food and nutritional security is a major roadblock that has to be completely cleared in order to give way to other pressing priorities for africa's economic growth and social development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It observed that 30 years ago, Africa was self-sufficient and a net exporter of food. Africa has lost that capacity to feed itself and more of our people go hungry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African leaders said unless the production trends of decline are altered, africa will be producing less than 75 per cent of its food requirements by the year 200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mass starvation in Africa will be averted when Africa begins once again to give due emphasis to the traditional food staples of millet, sorghum, peas, roots and tubers by enhanced technologies for production, processing, and distribution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidents attributed food and nutritional crisis on the continent to lack of commitment to implement realistic visions and policies to guide the agricultural and food sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They urged African governments to pay attention to and begin acting on the advice of their own private sector, research and development experts, policy analysts, technology practitioners and the traditional community leaders, who know a great deal about strategies for comunity-based food security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the Forum, the leaders endorsed the establishment of the African Foundation for Research and Development (AFRAND).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fund, to be based in Malawi, will be charged with the task of mobilising African scientific talents to contribute to human capital for the continent's economic and social progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe questioned its relevance, suggesting that its activities could be handled by existing organisations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - One year after its formation, the African Foundation for Research and Development (AFRAND), came under the spotlight here Tuesday with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe questioning its relevance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the Third Presidential Forum on management of science and technology in Africa, which established the Fund in Maputo, to spearhead science-led development on the continent,Mugabe said some of its functions could be better handled by existing organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggested that AFRAND's programmes such as food security be handled by existing organisations like the Southern African Development Community (SADC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he lauded the Fund's objectives, he said the political framework of the organisation's operations vis-a-vis, for example, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), was still unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Forum's closing session was delayed by about an hour because of discussions on the relevance of AFRAND.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said: &quot;this proliferation of bodies...I find it confusing. My country is looking at development in the context of regional organisations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he wondered whether AFRAND would work within existing bodies or as a separate entity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Zambian delegate said AFRAN was a costly body and was merely duplicating &quot;efforts&quot; of other bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, the Forum's new chairman, said it was his understanding that AFRAND was an autonomous body formed by African scientists who had grown &quot;impatient&quot; of being marginalised by existing bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he promised to look into the relationship between afrand and other regional bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the inauguration of AFRAND in Maputo last year, South African President Nelson Mandela declined to join, saying it was a costly organisation and that he needed to &quot;give a chance to our new generation of scientists in south africa to study it (AFRAND charter) and put forward their own concerns&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFRAND Charter was signed by 15 countries, including Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Aly Coulibaly PANA Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Senegal's head of state received the anxious relatives of four French tourists who went missing in strife-torn Casamance province and declared, regretfully, he had no clues as to their fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Abdou Diouf, addressing the three visitors at State House yesterday, said he had no information whether they were alive or dead in a disputed region claimed by separatist rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two French couples, on a vacation in the tropical Atlantic Ocean resort of Cape Skirring, disappeared April 6.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, thousands of Senegalese troops have been hunting for the tourists amid speculation they were abducted by guerrillas or accidentally killed by government troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dakar newspapers reported today that French President Jacques Chirac personally appealed to Diouf to do everything possible to find the tourists.  Chirac was on his first official visit to Senegal at the weekend since he won elections at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspapers said Diouf told the visitors, &quot;I can assure you that all I know, you know it now. And I can guarantee that none of those who are present here knows anything else that what I have told you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those at the meeting included Senegal's Prime Minister Habib Thiam, cabinet ministers, military chiefs and French ambassador Rene Ala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the independent daily Sud Quotidien the relatives feared the two couples were dead but said, &quot;We at least want to have their bodies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a desperate 11th-hour bid for information about the fate of the four, the relatives are scheduled Thursday to meet the leader of the guerrilla-backed Casamance Democratic Forces Movement, Catholic Father Diamacoune Senghor, in Ziguinchor, capital of Casamance some 450 kms south of Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senghor, whose guerrillas are fighting for independence, has been under house arrest since April 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Diouf's government previously barred any contacts between the relatives and the rebel chieftain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senghor, aged 70, has been directing the war since 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred people have been slain in the conflict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the results announced Monday by Interior Minister Louis Gaston Mayila, 96.48 of the voters cast ' Yes' ballots compared with 3.52 per cent who said ' NO' .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voter turnout rate was 63.45 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The definitive results of the referendum are expected to be proclaimed by the constitutional council in the coming days. Ppolling went on smoothly but aparthy was evident in the Central African country's urban centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the ruling party of President Omar Bongo, the Gabonese Democratic Party and opposition parties campaigned for a &quot;YES&quot; vote, the population in both urban and rural areas did not grasp the rationale for a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The massive positive vote will pave the way for the integral implementation of the Paris accords signed by representatives of Government and the Opposition, grouped under the High Council for Resistance (HCR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Paris accords called for the respect of the rule of law in Gabon, alternance in power and electoral transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two sides also agreed to streamline the electoral law to prevent fraud when polls are held in 18 months time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The New Zaire (NZ) seems set for a nose-dive like its predecessor having depreciated by nearly 2500 per cent in less than two years. Reports from Kinshasa said the NZ which exchanged at three to one US dollar in October 1993 when it replaced the Zaire, now exchages at a a mean rate of 70,000 to the American currency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zaire was replaced on 6 October 1993 after it collapsed to eight million to one dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other African currencies such as the Leone in Sierra Leone and the Guinea Franc are also headed for a crash with the Leone now exchanging at the rate of 820 to one Dollar, and the Guinean Franc at 1000 for one Greenback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only the CFA of the Franc zone, which was devalued by 50 per cent last year seems to be weathering the storm to the extent of appreciating by 20 per cent since then. The CFA continued its upward trend against the dollar, powered by the French franc, opening on Tuesday at the nomional rate of 481 to one dollar from 485.4 last week and 487.3 to the greenback three weeks ago. In Dakar Tuesday, the CFA exchanged at 466 (buying) and 497 (selling) from 470 (buying) and 500 (selling) to one dollar on 17 July.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Southern African Development Community (SADC) member-states have recommended the establishment of a sub-regional maritime policy to facilitate efficient port and shipping operations in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal is contained in a working document tabled at the ongoing Southern Africa Transport and Communications Commission (SATCC) meeting, which opened in Lusaka Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the document, the 11 SADC states speak of the need for a regional maritime policy to address various issues, including ownership options, commercialisation and the role of the private sector in ports and shipping operations. Other issues to be addressed in the proposed policy include administration of inland lakes and waterways.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental concerns, pollution and safety in the shipping industry are some of the other issues to be defined in the proposed policy, according to the document. A SATCC working group has already approved terms of reference for the policy study expected to be completed by April 1996 and funded by the Nordic Trust Fund. Among the terms of reference for the SADC maritime policy is definition of minimum port, ship as well as infrastructure and equipment standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is meant to safeguard against technology dumping and ensure that sub-standard ships outlawed in developed countries are not diverted to ports in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The region has a number of well developed ports which include Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, Durban in South Africa, Maputo in Mozambique and Walvis Bay in Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia, generally regarded as a ' landlocked' country, in 1994 had its Mpulungu port on the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika, upgraded as a fully-fledged port with the necessary infrastructure to handle international freight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The port's facilities were upgraded to carter for large volumes of famine relief food destined for war-ravaged Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five-day lusaka SATCC meeting is expected to, among other recommendations, spell out modalities for co-operation within specific areas of roads and road transport, railways, ports and shipping, civil aviation, telecommunications, postal services and meteorology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SATCC, headquartered in Maputo, Mozambique, is responsible for coordinating the development, management and operations of the regional transport and communications sectors for the 11-member SADCC grouping. The SADCC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KITWE, Zambia (PANA) - Rape is a significant route of HIV transmission in communities already heavily infected with the virus which causes AIDS, especially where it is commonly practiced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A workshop on aids was told Wednesday that the scale of rape is enormous in many parts of the world and was causing concern because of the aids epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 370,000 women are raped every year in South Africa, a country said to have the highest incidence of rape in the world, according to a paper presented at the workshop.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Twenty thousands Muslim women are said to have been raped in Bosnia's civil war. Studies in the USA show that one in five American women is likely to be raped&quot;, Jackson Mbwewe, the workshop's coordinator said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zambia there are approximately 32 reported rape cases and experts say many more cases go unreported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven million out of the 18 million adult HIV infected persons are in Africa, according to World Health Organization figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 70 and 80 percent of HIV infection world-wide is caused by sexual intercourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbewe said the campaign against AIDS has yet to take into account the reality of rape and efforts to inform people about HIV and how to protect themselves &quot;are irrelevant to those forced to have sex against their will&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the seminar Monday, Kitwe mayor William Nyirenda said it was not enough to advise people to use condoms when many women have no say in their partners' sexual behaviour and when child-bearing defines a woman's identity and status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the technically simple means of using a condom was culturally unacceptable to many people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Complex behavioural and social difficulties abound. these have worked to defeat the technically simple means of using a condom to stop the virus from spreading because they are often culturally unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poverty and cultural restraints continue to deprive people of control over their own lives and the power to protect themselves&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bishop of Ndola, Dennis de Jong told the workshop that there was need to protect the woman and to build up the moral values of our society which in the long term &quot;will help us to face the cirisis of aids&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-day workshop was attended by journalists, nurses, aids workers and docotors. It was sponsored by the German Ecunemical Organisation, Missio.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's Education ministry is investigating allegations that certain private schools were discriminating against black students by charging fees most Africans in that country cannot pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was said here Wednesday by the Deputy Education Minister, William Gumbochoma, when replying to a parliamentary question asked by Glen View's Member of Parliament, Clive Chimbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parliamentarian had said that racial discrimination was prevalent at some private schools, especially Eaglesvale.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his response, the Deputy Minister said the ministry was aware of discrimination at some schools but not at Eaglesvale, as purported by the member of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chimbi had said some white pupils at Eaglesvale had on two occasions carried out experiments on a black child, burning him around the neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gumbochuma conceded that on 29 June, a white pupil pressed a hot spoon used for lifting bee wax against a black boy's neck. But he said this was an accepted school boy prank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy minister said it was only when it had happened the second time in an art lesson that the black pupil reported the matter to the deputy head and senior master, after which the white pupil was beaten up and informed that any medical bill incurred would be met by him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The white pupil was also told he would be expelled if what he did happened again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It pains me to refer to the colour of the people's skins in an independent Zimbabwe, but I am at loss as to whether one would describe the above incident as racial discrimination being practised at Eaglesvale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, if the MP's have evidence of racial discrimination at some private schools, they should bring this to my ministry for investigations,&quot; said the Deputy Minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that &quot;at the moment, we are investigating allegations of racial discrimination at two private schools who are making a concerted effort to discriminate against blacks by hiking fees. I promise to work as expeditiously as possible on the matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - A planning meeting is taking place in Dakar Wednesday to prepare for a big trade mission from the American state of Louisiana, is expected here 8 to 13 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preparatory meeting is being attended by a number of Senegalese businesspeople and their counterparts from Louisiana in Southern United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forthcoming trade mission is among the first concrete actions after last May's African-African American Summit, during which the need for stronger trade ties between African countries and the USA was emphasized.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference Tuesday, the visitors, invited by the Dakar-based Afro-American Business Centre affirmed their desire to invest in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said their priority remains Senegal because the West African's businessmen and embassy in Washington have maintained contacts and calls for investments from the US business community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senegal is our primary objective because this country has huge opprtunities that warrant its development for 150 years&quot;,said Mr. William G.  Fousch, a specialist in international investment at the Economic DevelopmentD ivision of the state of Louisiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he added, &quot;The choice of Senegal does not meant hat we shall not go anywhere in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fousch and Rouse Caffey, Chancellor of the State University of Louisiana noted that some countries in the continent are on the point of attaining their development goal as they have succeded in improving their economy and reached a high standard of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have invested , they affirmed, in field Science and education in Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Cote D'Ivoire,S ierra Leone which bought tetanium, a metal used under water to develop agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Senegal, the American Businessmen said they had already taken contacts in Mali, Uganda and Kenya where they hope to be in a position to work with local partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Malick Diop, the President of the Afro-American Business Centre who announced the forthcoming opening of similar centres in Abidjan (Cote D'Ivoire), Lome(Togo) and Libreville (Gabon), Africa must now start working towards changing trends in the relations between the Continent and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May this year, Dakar hosted the Third African-African American Summit during which Mr. Ronald Brown, American Commerce Secretary, had asked his compatriots and businessmen to come and invest in Africa, which he described as &quot;a promising continent&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Pressure is mounting on Nigeria's military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha to show clemency for a group of military officers and civilians reportedly sentenced in connection with an alleged 1 March 1995 coup plot. The annoucement by the Defence Headquarters last week in Lagos of the undisclosed sentences, to be confirmed Abacha's supreme ruling organ, the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), has raised international concern and pleas.  Defence spokesman Brig. Gen Fred Chijuka confirmed that 40 of the 50 people who faced trial had been convicted, but he declined to give details. Coup plotting carries a maximum death sentence in Nigeria, which has seen some 10 failed and successful coups since its independence from Britain in October 1960.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community has particularly raised a hue and cry over the fate of Nigeria's former military ruler Gen.Olusegun Obasanjo, who appeared before the Lagos military tribuanl along with his former Deputy, Maj.Gen.  Shehu MusaYar'adua. Obasanjo is the only Nigerian military ruler in the country's almost 26 years of army rule, to have handed over to elected civilians in 1979. Reactions to the reported sentencing of the coup plotters have come from the United Nations, the Vatican, the Commonwealth of Nations, the United States, Japan, South Africa and the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UN spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said in New York Tuesday thatSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was &quot;very much concerned&quot; over the sentences and had contacted the Nigerian authorities on the matter. A French foreign ministry spokesman said Paris and its European partners had consulted on the issue and summoned the Nigerian ambassador in each country to express their concern.  The Catholic pontiff, John Paul II, has sent a delegation to Abacha pleading for clemency, while the Swiss foreign ministry issued a commmunique reminding Nigeria that it was a signatory to international laws covering civic and political rights. A statement by the Canadian High Commission in Lagos said &quot;Canada seriously questions the credibility of the sentences&quot; while Commonwealth Secretary-General, Emeka Anyaoku, a Nigerian, said in South Africa that commonwealth governments were &quot;deeply concerned&quot; and would discuss ways to help alleviate the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A delegation of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative visiting Nigeria urged Abacha in a letter to exercise &quot;sensitivity, generosity and leniency&quot; over those convicted of trying to overthrow him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PRC &quot;has now a unique opportunity to demonstrate to the watching world its magnanimity and that it is indeed dedicated to putting a stop to the depressing and self-perpetuating cycle of coups, arbitrary arrests and state executions,&quot; the letter added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a warning by the British Overseas Development Minister Baroness Lynda Chalker that Abacha might not be welcome to the November Commonwealth summit in New Zealand unless Nigeria improved its human rights record has met with strong reaction from the military administration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Former US President Jimmy Carter is flying to the Southern Sudan town of Juba Thursday in another attempt to bring a ceasefire in the civil war between government troops and rebels fighting for autonomy from Khartoum. Carter, who arrived here Wednesday afternoon, is also to continue efforts by his organisation &quot;Global 2000&quot; to fight guinea worm infestation in that part of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former President had earlier brokered a two-month ceasefire agreement between the government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) which expires 28 July. The warring parties agreed to the ceasefire to enable medical workers to travel to guinea worm-infested areas in the south.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an arrival statement, Mr Carter said he will be seeking a renewal of the ceasfire agreement, hoping that the government and the rebels &quot;who have seen the benefits of temporary peace can agree to a new ceasfire that could lead to permanent peace.&quot; He said he will meet the Sudanese President Gen. Omar elBashir and will confer with health officials on the eradication of the worm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Juba, the former US President is to fly to neighbouring Kenya for discussions with President Daniel Arap Moiwho has been leading mediation efforts in Sudan under the region's Inter-Government Authority on Drought and Development(IGADD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter said he will also fly to Kampala, Uganda to meet SPLA leader John Garang and President Yoweri Museveni, who is suspected by Sudanese leaders of being the major backer of the southern rebels. Kampala also accuses Sudan of harbouring rebels who are still active in Northern Uganda. The mutual accusations led to a diplomatic rupture between the two countries in May this year. However, the relations have been mended after mediation by Malawian President Bakili Muluzi, current Chairman of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa. The civil war in Southern Sudan, Africa's longest, has been on and off since the 1960s when guerillas known as &quot;AnyaAnya&quot; in the mainly non-muslim area started fighting forautonomy from the Arab dominated central government in Khartoum. The current war under John Garang's SPLA started in 1983.However, the SPLA has of late been hit by internal bickering, which split the movement into several rival groups which sometimes fight each other, giving the government an upper hand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLANTYRE, Malawi (PANA) - African consumer movements should take the worsening continental debt crisis seriously as it has adverse effects on consumers, said a document prepared by the Consumers International Regional Office for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document being circulated at the five-day African Consumers Organisations Workshop being held here, said Africa's debt servicing obligation was making the continent drift further into debt crisis thereby plunging the populace deeper into hardship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said in 1980, Sub-Sahara Africa's debt absorbed 29.1 percent or 56.2 billion United States dollars of their combined gross national product (GNP) of 192.8 billion USD.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the combined GNP for these countries had fallen to 168.5 billion dollars which was not enough to meet their present debt obligation which recently climbed to 183.4 billion dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the document, Africa's current debt constitutes 108 percent of its GDP compared to 37.6 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, 36.3 percent in South East Asiaand 27.9 percent in Asia and the Pacific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From being self-sufficient in food production 10 years ago, the document said the continent had now become a net importer of food. The recently concluded Uruguay agreement on global free trade managed by the new World Trade Organisation(WTO) would not help the continent's situation, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas free trade would result in the world benefitting to the tune of 292 billion dollars by the year 2002 in terms of the Uruguay agreement Africa was the only continent expected to suffer a net decline of 3 billion dollars a year during the same period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, the document said, required that African consumer movements be concerned about the continent's marginalisation and the effects of Structural Adjustment Programmes on the people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Moroccan capital, Chirac will travel to Yamoussoukro, capital of Cote d'Ivoire, where he will meet the Presidents of Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger and Togo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French President will then travel to Gabon for meetings with heads of state of Gabon, Cameroon, Central Africa,Congo and Chad in Libreville.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say the newly elected President's shuttle is aimed at assuring the former colonies that they would still enjoy the usual priority in France's external relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Francophone Africa was disillusioned by the 12 January 1994 50-per-cent devaluation of their currency, the CFA franc whose stability and convertibility had been guaranteed by thefrench treasury since 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics interpreted the devaluation inspired by the World Bank and the International Monetary fund (IMF) as an indication that Paris had lot interest in the former colonies.However, some Western Powers expected the move to break french business monopoly in the countries thereby opening them up to other partners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is asking donors to provide 44 million US dollars to finance the repatriation and rehabilitation of about 300,000 Angolan exiles now living in neighbouring African states and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior UNHCR official, Abou Moussa, told Thursday here the first tripartite meeting between the governments of Angola and Zambia and the UN refugee agency that only about 83,000 Angolans were likely to be involved in the repatriation exercise. The UN says Zaire with 200,000 has the largest number of Angolan refugees. Zambia has 96,000, Congo 12,000 while about 1,000 are registered in Namibia and 15,000 others in 32 other countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UNHCR spokesman based in South Africa Yusaf Hassen said Thursday that out of the estimated budget required for the exercise, 7.1 million is expected to be spent during the current year, 28.3 million in 1996 and the remaining 8.5 million dollars in 1997 for various purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some five million dollars will be used for transport and other logistics, 6.8 million on health and nutrition, 2.7 million for domestic needs, 1.9 million for community service, 1.2 million for crop production and one million for water facilities, according to Hassen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that about 6,000 Angolan refugees in Zaire have already returned to Angola on their own after the November 1994 Lusaka protocol was signed. An average of 10-12 persons are everyday leaving Zaire for Angola, he added.  Hassen said just about 4,000 refugees in the neighbouring countries have said they wanted to be assisted to leave for home immediately while the majority would want to go after harvesting their crops. UNHCR has decided to start the exercise in June/July 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the majority of the Angolan refugees to be repatriated will be settled in Moxico province which shares borders with both Zaire and Zambia.  The repatriation of the Angolan refugees is expected to be the second major operation conducted by UNHCR in Southern Africa. In 1994 the UNHCR repatriated 1.7 million Mozambican refugees in the first largest repatriation exercise ever to be undertaken by United Nations agency in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-day tripartite Lusaka meeting will work out the repatriation plan for some 26,000 Angolan refugess now settled in Meheba camp, northwestern Zambia and Mayukwayukwa in Kaoma, western Zambia. About 74,000 other Angolan refugees are settled in areas close to the Zambia-Angola border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lusaka protocol of 1994 ended 20 years of civil war that left an estimated 600,000 people dead and three million others displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the current talks,the Angolan delegation is led by Social Affairs Minister Albino Malungo while that of Zambia is headed by Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa. The former rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) of Jonas Savimbi, a signatory of the November 1994 peace agreement, is also represented at the meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLANTAYRE, Malawi (PANA) - African governments need re-evaluate the impact of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank prescribed economic reform programmes if the standards of living of their people are to improve, Director of Consumers International's Regional Office for Africa, Joshua Gwitira, said on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency (ZIANA) in Malawi's commercial city, Blantyre, Gwitira said the foreign prescribed economic structural adjustment programmes (ESAP) had brought enormous suffering to the African consumer as removal of subsidies made food and essential service sunaffordable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said for any economic structural adjustment programme to succeed its should be tailored to suit the economic conditions of individual country and its level of socio-economic development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The World Bank/IMF prescriptions do not take into account our level of development and our needs as nations. Wha twe urgently need now is to have a complete re-evaluation of our structural adjustment programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These adjustment programmes must be home brewed and should result in the re-instatement of subsidies on food, health and education until such a time as our economies become self-supporting,&quot;Gwitira said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the World Bank/IMF prescribed structural adjustment programmes had serious impact in West African countries some of which had reached unacceptable levels of importing goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under such circumstances, Africa should not be seen to cling to these programmes but to have each country look at its own needs and situation and make its own programme which will not cause unnecessary suffering of the people,&quot; Gwitira said. He suggested the adoption of home-grown structural adjustment programmes to promote individual countries'self-sufficiency instead of making them import-oriented.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - The Zairean government has said it will pay compensation to widows and orphans of the medical staff who died in the fight against the Ebola epidemic that killed more than 230 people in Kikwit, Bandundu Province, 450 km from here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors, nurses and other health workers who touched blood or fluids of people infected with the Ebola virus were among the first to die when a haemorrhagic fever epidemic broke out South East of the Zairean capital of Kinshasa between April and June this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was announced Tuesday by Prof. Tamfumu Muyembe, Chairman of the anti-Ebola International Technical and Scientific coordination committee.  He was speaking to journalists after briefing Prime MinisterKengo Wa Dongo on the situation relating to the epidemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muyembe said that after hearing the complaints of lack of electricity in Kikwit, the Prime Minister has allocated40 barrels of diesel to ensure that the area gets power on a regular basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also hinted that the prime minister had promised to pay up salary arrears owed to Kikwit health workers and a special bonus to the members of the international committee against the epidemic, based in the same town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the current situation on the ground, Dr Muyembeconfirmed that the disease is totally under control, except for one or two cases being monitored at the hospital in Kikwit after surviving the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Institute of Tropical Medecine in Antwerp, Jean-Pierre Lahaye of the Belgian medical cooperation in Zaire,the World Health Organisation and the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme have been awarded the &quot;Zairean Livre-Foundation Prize&quot; (PRIZALI) for their &quot;remarkable contribution in the fight against the hemorragic fever caused by the Ebola virus in Kikwit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PIZALI-Foundation is a recently founded Zairean NGO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also awarded a Prize to President Mobutu Sese Seko and Dr Muyembe for their respective contributions to the maintenance of peace in the world and to the protection of mankind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The award winners not only contributed to the eradication of the epidemic but they also promised to set up research centres in addition to a modern media facility to educate the populations concerned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Paul Fauve, PANA Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Mozambican authorities are fuming with anger over South Africa's intention to construct adam at Injaka on the Sabie river, despite being told that this will worsen water shortages in the south of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sabie rises in South Africa and flows into Mozambique where it joins the Incomati, to become the largest river in southern Mozambique. Without the water from the Sabie, the lower reaches of the Incomati could be reduced to a trickle, wit hsevere consequences for agriculture.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a report in Thursday's issue of the Maputo paper 'Noticias', the matter was raised on Monday at a tripartite meeting on water resources between Mozambique, South Africa andSwaziland, held in Boane district, about 40 kilometres west of Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African delegation reportedly treated the construction of the new dam as a decision that could not be changed, and turned down all requests from the Mozambicans to reconsider the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Luis Elias, the Director of Mozambique's National Water Board, who chaired the meeting, the South Africans claimed the dam was an old project and was needed to satisfy the basic needs of people in the Transvaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elias suggested that the South Africans were lying, and that the dam was really intended to benefit agro-industries, rather than to provide drinking water. &quot;We know that this wateris intended, not for public consumption, but for irrigation&quot;,' Noticias' quoted him as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We told South Africa that we don't agree with the unilateral decision to build a dam on an international river, and without Mozambique's approval&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Africans have promised to allow 0.3 cubic metres of water to flow along the Sabie into Mozambique, but Elias said he does not believe this. He pointed out that the current flow was already inferior to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further bone of contention is an environmental impact study on the Incomati basin, which the South Africans promised to finance. The study is not finished and the South Africans say they have run out of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the one hand, the South Africans stop funding the environmental studies in the Incomati basin, but on the other they begin to build a dam at Injaka', protested Elias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, Mozambique's water supply was threatened when authorities in neighbouring Zimbabwe hatched plans to launch major projects to divert the Pungue river for agricultural purposes and to supply the Eastern city of Mutare. Mozambican protests have so far prevented the start of such projects because the country's second largest city, Beira on the Indian Ocean, depends on the Pungue for its drinking water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of the Pungue will be under negotiation at a meeting between the Mozambican and Zimbabwean water authoritiesto be held shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An angry Elias remarked that, as regards the rivers in the South of Mozambique, 'the countries upstream do what they like, and it's we who suffer'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early 1992, a major water conference held in Dublin,Ireland, which prepared the June 1992 Earth Summit that too kplace in Brazil, proposed that countries enter into agreements to avert future conflicts on the utilisation of shared river and lake waters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Tobacco growers have revised the expected output of flue-cured tobacco this year to about 194 million kilogrammes up from the previous estimate of 186 millionkg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Growers' second and final assessment indicate a crop of about 194 million kg which will earn the country nearly ZD threebillion (USD 353 million),&quot; Zimbabwe Tobacco Association marketing director Pat Davies told said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the tobacco marketing board's second estimate however still maintained the expected output at 190 million kg.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year 169 million kg of flue-cured tobacco - thecountry's largest export earner - were auctioned bringing in ZD2.3 billion (USD 271 million) in hard currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davies said the industry still remained buoyant, with the average price already above ZD 17 (USD 2) per kg. As of Wednesday, 95,679,857 kg representing about 50 percent of the expected output had been sold at an average price of ZD 17.07(USD 2.03) per kg since auction floors opened on April 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provided prices continue to soar, some analysts have already forecasted that the average price would reach zd 18.26(USD 2.15) per kg when auction floors close in the early week of October. This compares with an average price of ZD 14.71 (USD1.73) last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davies said the auction season was proceeding well with a lot of cheaper offshore funds available to finance the crop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shipments of tobacco to overseas markets was expected to pick up in September. There was currently heavy demand for superior quality tobacco in the export markets, a situation that would help boost the Zimbabwean economy as the crop which had been produced this year was of a higher quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZTA had already recommended a 10 percent increase in hectarage to satisfy the expected jump in demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A larger crop size of 210 million kg was expected to be produced in the coming season.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspensions came barely a day after Chavunduka's warning on Wednesday that he would flex his muscles after students, lecturers and workers marched into the city centre on Wednesday demanding his suspension to facilitate investigations into alleged maladministration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several students were injured during the clashes, buildings damaged while riot police, widely criticised for the heavy handed manner in which they handled the demonstrations,wantonly fired tear gas canisters into administration offices and halls of residence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Wildlife policemen in Zambia's northwestern Mwinilunga District bordering Angola are faced with a dilemma of how to stop a thriving barter trade in poached game meat believed to be from the neighbouring country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dealers in the suspected poached meat have defied the authority of local wildlife police to arrest them, claiming that Zambian police do not have the powers to catch them for trading in &quot;foreign animals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the wild animals are depleted in Mwinilunga and why should we be harassed when even the wildlife policemen know th esource of the meat (in Angola),&quot; one man is quoted as saying Friday by newspapers here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wildlife Police Officer-in-Charge for Mwinilunga Dexter Ilukena is said to have confirmed Thursday that some Zambians were engaged in barter trade for game meat supplied by Angolans at various border areas in the district. He vowed to punish all those invloved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We shall continue to deal ruthlessly with anyone found with game meat,&quot; Ilukena is reported to have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the border area Zambians who are said to be exchanging sugar, salt, soap and secondhand clothing, among other items, for the meat are reportedly adamant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most game meat &quot;traders&quot; quoted by local dailies are said to have insisted that there was no logic in Zambian police&quot;involving themselves&quot; in their &quot;normal business&quot; and threatened to deal with any wildlife policeman who would stand in their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ilukena has maintained that there was no way his men could distinguish between &quot;Angolan and Zambian meat&quot; and will go ahead to arrest anybody found with meat or firearms without licence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - The Sudanese government has shown reluctance to accept former US President Jimmy Carter's call for an extension of the two month ceasefire agreement it entered with southern rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr.Ghazi Salhuddin, Sudan's Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs, the government had told Mr.Carter it does not see any progress towards peace in the country. &quot;Sudan was reserved towards Carter's request to extend the ceasefire in the south,&quot; the minister of state said at the end of talks between the former American President and the Sudanese leader, Gen.  Omar El Bashir here. The ceasefire brokered by Carter, which took effect 26 May, ends in a week's time. Carter flew into Khartoum last Wednesday in the hope of building upon the cease fire. He also came to inspect a project his organization 'Global 2000' is undertaking to eliminate guinea worm infestation and river blindness in southern Sudan. But, according to the minister of state, the government told the guest that it was not happy with the ceasefire arrangement because the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army(SPLA) disrespected and even benefited from the ceasefire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the SPLA violated the ceasefire and cited an incident last month &quot;when the rebels hijacked a UN plane carrying Sudanese relief workers and forced it to land in a rebel-held area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Carter did not seem to be discouraged by the reservations of the Sudanese government. Speaking to news men Thursday on his arrival in the southern city of Juba, the former US President said he will be going to Nairobi to meet Kenya's President Daniel Arap Moi to further discuss the peace process in Sudan. Moi who leads a mediation effort under theInter-Government Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD), an Eastern African organisation whose members are Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda. IGADD has so far convened two unsuccessful rounds of peace talks between the rebels and the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting from Juba, the Sudan News Agency (SUNA) quoted Mr.Carter as saying he will be flying to Kampala to meet SPLA leader John Garang and Ugandan President Yowei Museveni, as part of the search for peace in southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUNA said Carter had acknowledged the Sudanese governments search for the stability of southern Sudan. He expressed the hope that &quot;the other parties to the southern Sudan dispute respond to the peace effort and allow innocent children and disabled citizens to benefit from the efforts now underway to eliminate guinea worms and river blindness in the south.&quot; He did not name those other parties. However, this could mean the various SPLA factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Carter said he will be returning to Khartoum to inform Sudanese officials on the outcome of his talks in Nairobi and Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter was in Juba to review the progress reached in the eradication of guinea worms by his organisation 'Global 2000'.Southern Sudan has one third of the world's cases of Gunea worms. Entire districts in southern Sudan are also infected with river blindness, recent government reports indicated. PANA YH/PBM 21JULY95</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Mildred Mulenga, PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Andrew Sardanis, the former Chairman of the collapsed Meridien BIAO Bank (Zambia) being sought authorities in Lusaka for suspected fraud, has denied theallegations and said he will return to Zambia next August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued from New York Thursday and widely quoted by the local press Friday, Sadanis denied that he and his bank directors had fraudently transfered 90 billion Kwacha to unidentified foreign accounts, as alleged in a recent audit report released by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sardanis, a major shareholder in the defunct bank, said he was confident that upon a complete and full investigation, he will be exonerated.He welcomed Chiluba's decision to hire international investigators to further probe the scandal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Chiluba told a news conference here that the government had engaged security experts to trace Sardanis for possible prosecution and enable the Zambian government retrieve public funds advanced to the bank in an earlier failed bid to bail it out of its liquidity problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by KPMG, an accountants firm, presented to government last week, indicated that some 90 billion kwacha had been fraudently transfered to unidentified foreign accounts. (915kwacha=one us dollar).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm had been commissioned by Zambia's Central Bank to study reasons that had led to the collapse of the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that only a paltry 4.3 billion kwacha of the 39 billion kwacha depositors funds was recoverable and blamed its collapse mainly on mismanagement and fraudulent activities by shareholders. But Sardanis in his statement Thursday noted that he had not received a copy of the report but that the figures &quot;bandied about cannot possibly correspond to reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributed the failure of the bank to a number of factors which included 'civil wars, currency devaluations and unfavourable economic conditions in a number of African countries and hostility from several British institutions.' BIAO's branches in several African countries have faced similar problems prompting governments to step in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian government had earlier this year pumped in 8.4billion kwacha to try and prevent the collapse of the private-ownedmultinational bank but the funds went into an abyss. Later, Finance Minister Ronald Penza tried to merge the instituion with the state-owned Zambia National Commercial Bank but the move was rescinded by cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Meridien Bank had been the fourth largest bank in Zambia with over 100 billion kwacha worth of assets and about 40 000 depositors. PANA MM/MK/PBM 21JULY95</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The head of the 53-nation Organization of African Unity has joined world leaders and human rights movements in appealing to Nigeria's military leader for the release of recently convicted political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim told reporters today, he personally wrote to Gen. Sani Abacha seeking clemency for some 40 Nigerians including former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo secretly sentenced last week in connection with an alleged coup plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim, in his July 17 message, warned that those sentenced by a military tribunal -- most to life imprisonment, some to death -- could affect the stability of Nigeria and its international image.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish to draw particular attention to the case of General Olusegun Obasanjo ... who even after leaving office had acquired the status of an African and world statesman,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary-general dismissed suggestions that the pan-African boy was not concerned about events in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are concerned about crises in our continent,&quot; he told a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obasanjo, who was reportedly sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for links to a military-led coup attempt against Abacha, played a key role in steering South Africa to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said in his message to Abacha that &quot;you will be assuring a place for yourself in history by being magnanimous inthe greater interest of Nigeria, its unity, cohesion and reputation and, indeed, the larger interests of our continent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) is planning to hold an extra-ordinary ministerial session next month to discuss ways of resolving the ethnic and political conflict in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing this at a news conference in Addis Ababa Friday, OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim said ministers in the continental organisation's central organ on conflict resolution will meet 29 August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that in view of the deteriorating security situation in Burundi, the OAU is to send a delegation to visit countries neighbouring Burundi to discuss with the leadershio on measures to be taken to resolve the crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary General said proposed mission to Rwanda,Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda is to assess the Burundi situation and see what measures can be taken by African states in collaboration with the United Nations, to end the Burundi crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a serious element of insecurity in Burundi&quot;and there is a need for Africa to make sure that the situation which occured in Rwanda (last year) is not repeated in Burundi&quot;,Salim told journalists in the Ethiopian Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim did not specify when the delegation will leave forthe Great Lakes area or its composition, but said it would be sent in the &quot;very near future&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A meeting on Burundi was supposed to be held in Addis Ababa from 27-28 July but it has been called off following strong objections by several Burundian political parties which insisted such a meeting should take place within the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed meeting between leaders of 13 political parties as well as the military hierachy, was supposed to promote peace and national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim regretted the cancellation of the meeting, saying&quot;the OAU had placed a lot of expectations on the meeting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU Executive warned Burundi leaders that a foreign military intervention should not be ruled out in case of chaos.He urged the leadership in Bujumbura to take the concern of Africa seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any attempt to remove the government (by the military)&quot;, he reiterated,&quot;will create more problems, leading to more disaster&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attempt by the OAU to send a 200 strong military force was resisted by opposition parties. But the OAU maintains an observer mission of about 60 people in the central African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi is still suffering from the backlash of thea ssassination of Hutu President Melchior Ndadaye 21 October 1993,only three months after being elected in the country's first multiparty polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revenge killings between the majority Hutu and Tutsi tribesmen have led to an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 deaths.Several hundreds of Burundians have fled into exile in neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former minister of the interior has gone underground and his group is waging an on and off guerilla war against positions of the Tutsi-dominated army.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Rebels fighting for the separation of the southern Casamance region from the rest of Senegal wounded three government soldiers and an eight year oldgirl in a surprise attack against a military camp there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting Friday, a privately-owned daily, Wal Fadjri, quoted unidentified military source who attributed the attack Wednesday, 45 km south east of the regional capital of Ziguinchor, to guerillas of the Casamance Democratic Forces Movement (MFDC) . The incident was the third of its kind since Monday when the MFDC fighters reportedly gunned down a government soldier andseriously wounded four others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has sent a large force in Casamance to search for four tourists who disappeared in the area on 6 April and have not been seen ever since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daily quoted the unidentified military source as saying &quot; because of the pourousness of our borders, we cannot control those who come in or go out. That's why the rebels hold such a large quantity of arms and ammunition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinea-Bissau said last Monday that it will not permit the entry of MFDC into their territory because they had now resorted to looting food from the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continued attacks show that some MFDC fighters operate independently from the movement's Secretary General, Catholic priest Diamacoune Senghor, who was to meet Friday with relatives of the missing tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The priest has since 21 April been placed under house arrest after he accused the French and Senegalese governments of hiding the said tourists, in a conspiracy to send in large numbers of soldiers to crush the MFDC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two government denied the allegations and the European country has sent into Casamance policemen to help in the search for the missing two couples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1982, the Southern region of Casamance, whose capital is 450 km from Dakar, has been rocked by a guerilla war waged by the MFDC which is calling for the area's autonomy from the rest of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several thousands of rebels, government soldiers and civilians have been killed in the region, a major tourist destination in this West African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 50-page document, Father Diamacoune Senghor denies that Casamance has never fallen under French rule, despite documentary evidence produced by a French expert in 1994 to prove him wrong.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Litana has of late been the target of at least four foreign clubs including a top Argentine side which had expressed interest in signing on the lanky defender, described by some soccer commentators at the 1994 Tunis Africa cup finals as among the most intelligent African full-backs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is best remembered for his thunderous header against Nigeria scored during the Africa cup finals, won by the West Africans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique's Trade Union Federation (OTM), Soares Nhaca, warned Thursday that his organisation will call a general strike if by15 August government has not either met its demands, or resumed negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviewed by Mozambican Television, Nhaca said that in June the OTM had presented a series of proposals to the government, including a substantial increase in the statutory minimum wage, amendments to the labour law, and measures to protect workers from mass redundancies under the privatization ofpublic companies imposed by the World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week ago the union's leadership met with government representatives and demanded 'specific measures' to meet the trade union demands, and the resumption of negotiations by 15 August.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is no reaction from the government by then, when the OTM's relevant bodies meet the decision will certainly be to call a general strike&quot;, said Nhaca.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last tripartite negotiations between the government,the unions and employers' associations took place in February,but ended without agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government gave a 35 per cent increase which raised the monthly industrial minimum wage to 158,650 meticais - now worth less than 16 US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unions had wanted an 85 per cent increase, but eventually dropped their demand to 40 per cent while the government would not budge from 35 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OTM says its calculations show that the current minimum wage can only cover 26 per cent of the basic monthly food needs of a worker.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The Angolan government has undertaken to provide protection to the 26,000 Angolan refugees to be repatriated from Zambia, a senior United Nations official said in Lusaka Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefing the press on deliberations of the first tripartite meeting on Angolan refugees, Regional Public Information Officer for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Yusuf Hassan said the Angolan government will provide security for the refugees to aviod any possible harassment or intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the refugees will also be given access to land. On claims to property, Hassan said the Angolan government could not commit itself to give the refugees back their properties since the property might have been destoryed during the war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hassan said the UNHCR will soon embark on information campaign on the dangers of land mines in Angola estimated to be between 10-20 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-day meeting between the Zambian and Angolan government and the UNHCR considered an operational plan for the repatriation of 26,000 angolan refugees now settled in Maheba, North-Western Zambia and Mayukwayukwa in Kaoma, Western Zambia which harbours some 3,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 74,000 other angolan refugees are settled in areas close to the Zambia-Angola border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting also looked at the transportation of the refugees, registeration and documentation, border entry and exit, customs and immigration formalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repatriation of some 300,000 Angolan refugees in neighbouring African countries and elsewhere is expected to start in June 1996. UNHCR has asked the donor community for 44 million United States dollars to finance the repatriation and rehabilitation of the refugees. About 83,000 Angolan refugees were likely to be involved in the repatriation exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money is meant for transport and other logistics, health and nutrition, other domestic needs and community service for the returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other projects needing finance include agriculture and water supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hassan had said Thursday that the repatriation of the Angolan refugees is expected to be the second major operation conducted by UNHCR in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994 the UNHCR repatriated 1.7 million Mozambican refugees in the first largest repatriation exercise ever to be undertaken by the United Nations Agency in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Conflicts and refugees in Africa, a looming political crisis in Niger and the Vatican's view on the role of women in modern society are some of the issues discussed in African newspapers this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees remain &quot;a cause for concern&quot; for the continent in general and countries in the Horn of Africa in particular, the 'Ethiopian Herald' said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the paper, large numbers of people continued to cross the Ethiopian border from the east and the influx was far from diminishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Herald reported a similar trend in western Ethiopia along the border with Sudan saying &quot;It is a pity to see such situations taking place when Ethiopia itself has returned to peace and begun resettling its own refugees back from neighbouring countries.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper attrributes this to continued fighting in neighbouring countries such a s Somali and Sudan pointing out that it was time the international community paid attention to the problem of conflicts and refugees in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspapers in Burkina Faso and Senegal joined the LibyanNews Agency (JANA) in criticising the continued imposition ofsanctions against Tripoli and the political stalemate in Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States of America, the greatest power in the world, does no hesitate to accuse Libya, a small country of four million people, located over 10,000 miles of its coast, of threatening its national security,&quot; JANA said in an editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to president Clinton's decision to extend by six months the embargo against Libya, the agency which generally expresses government opinion on issues, &quot;absurd and unfounded&quot; accusations of official Libyan involvement in the bombing of a PanAm jumbo jet over Lockerby in Scotland in 1988 in which hundreds of of people died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JANA claimed there was a strong link between the U.S embargo, in force since 1986, and the UN Security Council sanctions implemented since 15 April 1992, &quot;under U.S</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pressure&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It urged Washington to consider dialogue with Tripoli and abandon its policy against &quot;the independence, freedom and progress of small countries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal - 'Le Pays', a newspaper based in Burkina Faso took issues with the political squabbles in Niger, wondering whether democracy was not under threat in the country considering the seriousness of the conflict between president Mahamane Ousmane and prime minister Hama Amadou?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inability of the two men to work together underscores the deep-seated antagonism between the two major political groups in Niger, one led by the head of state and the other by the prime minister whose party won a majority in the parliament in early election held in January, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Le Pays' described the crisis as a &quot;political guerilla war&quot;, adding &quot;the turn taken by democracy in Niger is becoming a cause for concern&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a country whose economy is already suffering, this is enough to ...  create an explosive social situation,.&quot; the paper warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A satirical weekly based in Ouagadougou also discussed the crisis, saying in spite of the mediation by former president Amadou Toumani Toure of Mali, the ultimate could be the return of a military regime similar to the one headed by late Gen. Seyni Kountche from 1974 to 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Senegal's official 'Le Soleil' newspaper was not that pessimistic. &quot;The initiative holds a glimmer of hope,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Toumani Toure's &quot;personal initiative&quot; provides Niger politicians &quot;an opportunity to settle their dispute without losing face&quot;, the paper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Sud Quotidien', an independent daily, commented on the recent African tour by United Nations Secretary General Boutros-Ghali, focusing on his visit to Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The meeting (with Jonas Savimbi) in Bailundo (UNITA stronghold in south-central Angola) was significant, since the mediators in the Angolan civil war have always refused to visit the rebels' headquarters&quot;, the paper noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kampala, 'The Monitor' commented on Pope John Paul's (new) views on the role of women in modern society in a letter by Pope John Paul II apologising for the Catholic Church's role in oppressing women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pontiff made a very stout defence of equal pay for equal work, protection for working mothers, fairness in career advancement, equality of spouses with regard to family rights, and the recognition of everything that is part of the rights and duties of a citizen in a democratic era&quot;, the paper noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It noted that, &quot;The traditional view of the Catholic establishment has been that women should stay home, rear childern - very many at that - cook, and knit their men's socks and shirt collars&quot;, hoping that ongoing repentance at the Vatican would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">change all this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even now, the paper said, &quot;his position on abortion, for example, is very extreme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Pope's letter maintained the See's anachronistic position that women will never be ordained priests&quot;, it added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - While every day Mozambicans run the risk of being blown up by landmines planted in the civil war customs officers refuse to release donated equipment designed to clear minefields -- and save lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve French-made mine detectors, a gift from the Paris government, have been held up at Maputo Airport since they arrived in March, the semiofficial Mozambique News Agency reported today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are intended for Mozambique Army sappers who were trained by French experts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 28 the French Embassy sent a letter to the foreign ministry with a copy to the defence ministry, alerting the government to the need to clear the equipment through customs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This should have been a simple formality, since defence equipment is exempt from paying import duties under a government decree of 1988, the Mozambique agency said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign ministry declared the detectors should be cleared duty free.  The customs department ruled that the defence ministry should seek the exemption. All the French Embassy's relevant documents were meantime delivered to the army's general staff officer in charge of engineering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But nothing happened. Noone claimed the detectors, and storage charges mounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regularly French diplomats would telephone the defence ministry, reminding it of the need to take the equipment out of the airport. Even the minister himself, Aguiar Mazula, was directly informed of the problem. Still nothing happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, after three months, the French Embassy issued an ultimatum: either the ministry clear the detectors through customs, or France would withdraw the equipment and give it to some other deserving country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, deputy defence minister Antonio Hama Thai has contacted the embassy to ask for another set of copies of the documentation concerning the equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence ministry now promises that the detectors will be out of the airport by early next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet life-saving equipment, which cost Mozambique nothing, has sat uselessly in a customs warehouse for almost four months, the Mozambique agency said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insensitive bureaucratic procedures and straightforwarddisorganisation are constant headaches in Mozambique, against which businessmen, diplomats, and even government ministers frequently complain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Joaquim Chissano himself earlier this week spoke of the need to make the state apparatus more efficient, more responsive to public needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this instance, the habitual lethargy of the Mozambican bureaucracy may have cost lives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - One of three Zimbabwean newspaper executives on trial over a false report about President Robert Mugabe's marriage today opted to distance himself from the other two accused and pleaded guilty to defamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy editor of the Financial Gazette, a privately-owned weekly often critical of Mugabe's government, said he wanted a speedy conclusion to the case as he had no money to defend himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simba Makunike, instead, pleaded guilty to a charge of criminally defaming a judge and a cabinet minister by reporting erroneously that they played a role in a wedding between Mugabe and secretary Grace Marufu last April.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe has angrily told journalists that reports he had secretly married the secretary after the death of his Ghanaian-wife, Sally, were none of their business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both High Court Judge Paddington Garwe and Public Construction Minister Enos Chikowore have denied Gazette accounts saying they witnessed a formal ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magistrate William Cutler said he will decide on July 26 whether to split up the trial -- one for the deputy editor and another for chief executive Elias Rusike and executive editor Trevor Ncube, both of whom pleaded innocent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the trial opened early this month all three accused conceded the stories were false but pleaded not guilty, saying they did not intend to defame anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other newspapers and magazines have reported that Mugabe secretly married Ms. Marufu, saying she had borne him two children before and after the death of his wife.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Locusts that escaped survey and control in spring breeding areas of North-West Africa are bound to spread into Central and Southern Mauritania as well as in Northern parts of Mali and Senegal between now and mid-August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) says two swarms that crossed into northern Senegal in late June and others have crossed the southern border of Mauritania into western Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bulletin issued to PANA Friday, Fao said additional locust swarms were expected between now and mid-August in Central Mauritania and north Mali's Nioro and Nara areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It predicted a few additional groups in the Adrar des Iforas and Tamesna and in western Mali where they will mature rapidly and lay with the onset of summer rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the end of the forecast period, hoppers bands are likely to form on a small scale,&quot; said the document, adding that locusts are expected to mature and lay rapidly in northern Niger's Tamesna and Air areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The destructive insects are also expected to appear in North Chad's Bet area with the onset of rains while a few additional adult groups and swarms of locusts are likely to appear in northern Senegal. These are expected to multiply rapidly with the onset of rains, FAO said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Guinea Conakry are out of the locust threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Algeria and Morocco, FAO predicts a further decline in locust infestation due to control and emigration as well as worsening ecological conditions for the insects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the UN agency says adult locusts will persist in Algerian areas that might remain green, primarily near Adrar, in Salah and in the Wadis near Hoggar Mountains as well as in Morocco's Atlas Mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Eastern Africa, scattered groups of adult locusts are believed to be present in Sudan's northern Kordofan, northern Darfur and White Nile Provinces. Fao says laying is expected when rains start and that hoppers will be there by mid-August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scattered adults are expected in the few areas that receive rain in Eritrea's western lowlands and in northern Somalia's western coastal plains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania are out of danger during the forecast period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, following a locust invasion in the Lake Nakivale area of southwestern Uganda, the government of President Yoweri Museveni recently set up an Emergency Anti-Locust fund dotted with 300,000 US dollars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference here Monday, President Frederick Chiluba also confirmed that the government had requested expert financial investigators from a friendly country to conduct further inquire into the bank's financial scandal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba had said last week that an initial audit reporthad indicated that some 90 billion Kwacha had been fraudently transfered to unidentified foreign accounts. (1$=915 Kwacha).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He conceded that government's attempt to bail out the bank had bust this year's national budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) criticised the move and has since withheld further aid until government institutes other measures to raise additional local revenue to balance the budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the President told newsmen his government was almost succeeding in keeping expenditure within limits of available revenue and that the IMF will be reviewing its assistance to the country this September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Minister Ronald Penza had early this year pumped some 8.4 billion kwacha into the cash-strapped privately-owned Meridien bank in a failed bid to salvage it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later announced its closure and that he was merging it with the government-owned Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZANACO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The zambian cabinet over-turned the proposed merger, saying it was illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Meridien bank had been the fourth largest bank in Zambia with over 100 billion Kwacha worth of assets and about 40,000 depositors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last February, most depositors around the country closed their accounts following rumours of its financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources within the collapsed bank have said that Sardanis, a Greek-Cypriot Zambian financier, had transfered large sums of money to Europe and America.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KIFFA, Mauritania (PANA) - A butane gas depot filling centre was officially inaugurated Saturday at Kiffa, southern Mauritania, by the country's Water and Energy Minister, Mohamed Lemine Ould Ahmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a capacity of 2,500 cubic metres, the complex has three reservoirs of 30 m3 each, a generator and a 47-m3 cistern.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction work lasted nine months and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cost 85 million ouguiya (1usd = 130 ouguiya), totally funded by the Mauritanian Gas Company (SOMAGAZ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the minister, the centre is capable of supply the Assaba disctrict with butane gas,thus enabling each household to save at least 15,000 ouguiya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lemine Ould Ahmed stressed in his speech that the generalised use of butane gas could reduce tree felling for charcoal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tonne of butane gas is equal to 10 hectares of forest, he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Butane gas consumption in Mauritania rose from 5,000 tonnes in 1988 to 13,000 tonnes in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The construction of the gas depot centre in Kiffa follows the building of water and electricity distribution facilities. The minister said it is part of an &quot;ambitious</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The 62 black ostriches transported from a north African desert two months ago to Qindao in northern China have reportedly rapidly acclimatized and some have even started laying eggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African black ostrich, which weighs between 120 and kg by the first anniversary, is the biggest among the bird species and can live for 70 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a year, a female ostrich lays about 100 eggs, out of which only 50 to 60 of which hatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is because of its rapid reproduction characteristics and longevity that several countries have imported the African ostrich which is also easy to tame, reported the Chinese News Agency 'Xinxhua' in a dispatch received by PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ostriches are famous for their meat which contains little fat and cholesterol and is rich in protein. Its skin makes good quality leather, characterised by its lightness, durability and beauty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China currently has only 2,000 ostriches, but ostrich breeding is being encouraged under the 'Torch' research project on the virtues of the world's largest bird.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A first group of 36 ostriches imported from Southern Africa to north China's Shandong Province reportedly quickly adapted to the area's harsh weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second biggest ostrich breeding centre in China is at Rongcheng.It cost about 2.5 million US dollars to establish and stretches over 40,000 square metres. It is only second to that of Guangdong in southern China.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Persistent drought has obliged Zimbawe to double its power imports from neighbouring Zambia and Zaire to a total of 300 megawwats effective 1 July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The electrical power imports are expected to enable the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) maintain normal supply services following a drastic drop in Lake Kariba's water level from where most of the country's power is generated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Friday, the power utility appealed for voluntary energy conservation measures by all consumers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Efficient utilisation will not only assist in mitigating the adverse impact of the drought but also makes financial sense as customers can avoid unnecessarily high electricity bills,&quot; said ZESA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a normal year ZESA's Kariba South Power Station can provide at least one third of the country's requirements, the rest coming from the four thermal power stations at Hwange,in the northwest, Harare and Munyati in Central and Bulawayo, South Western Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bulawayo power station's output has also been reduced to less than one third of its output due to water rationing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZESA said the Kariba River Basin recorded the worst rainfall this rainy season since the collection of records began on 1907.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below average inflows have been recorded into the lake since the 1981/1982 season resulting in low reservoir levels at the Kariba hydro complex on the border with Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result the energy available for both Zimbabwe and Zambia from the Kariba complex has to be a limited to a maximum of 4 000 gigawatt hours for the year 1995/96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This energy is shared equally between ZESA and ZESCO (Zambia Electricity Supply Commission). This leaves an energy deficit of 1 000 gigawatt hours for each utility for the year to be met from imports and energy conservation measures,&quot; said ZESA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current allocation would leave the Lake Kariba level at 476,6 metres by November 1995, about one metre above the minimum operating level of 475,5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new inter-connector between Insukamini in Zimbabwe and Matimba in South Africa, expected to come into service by December 1995 or January 1996 is also expected to mitigate the impact of the drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the Authority has so far spent 4.2 million US dollars) to refurbish its power line carrier (PLC) system which is used to transmit speech, telex, fax, control and equipment protection data to various generation and transmission centres.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Kibaniakina M.N, PANA Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA)- African newspapers this week swung their attention towards development needs, regional cooperation, the United Nations role in peacekeeping and the political scenario in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian Herald said that in the 53 Organization of African Unity (OAU) member states, efforts made for development were being hampered by serious domestic conflicts whereas Ouagadougou's daily Le Pays contended the obstacles were caused by Western-imposed structural adjustment programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the headline Peace for Development, the daily noted that &quot;developments during the past few years show that conflict situations continue to occur at a speed greater than the capacity of peace forces to contain them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is particularly true of Africa where new hotbeds of tensions breed with each passing time in spite of the commitment and resolute determination shown by African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries to curb such a trend,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU, the paper declared, &quot;has been created to bring peace and security in Africa within a global framework of development momentum.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time has come for the OAU to embark on such a mission. Africa has suffered a lot and people can no longer bear the consequences of other bloody wars like that which is looming in Somalia and other countries,&quot; the daily said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Addis Ababa based paper &quot;undeniably, the issue of conflicts is the most pressing of all challenges facing Africa today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conflicts cast a &quot;dark shadow over the prospects for a united, secure and prosperous Africa which we seek to create,&quot; said the Herald.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Conflicts have already cost the continent enormously. Men, women and children have been uprooted, dispossessed, deprived of their means of livelihood and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thrown into exile,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It denounced the &quot;dehumanization of a large segmentof the African populations&quot; by the conflicts. And it added that the situation was &quot;unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue &quot;otherwise Africa will continue to be mired in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confusion and its people condemned to misery and suffering&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the duty of the OAU and all peace forces to assist in bringing peace and restore hope to people,&quot; the Herald said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It lauded the actions of the continental body and all other groupings which &quot;made efforts to look for solutions to conflicts in the continent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The OAU leaders and all concerned groups have intervened constructively in conflict situations with a view to promoting their peaceful settlement,&quot; the Ethiopian paper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kampala, the New Vision urged Kenya to appoint the Secretary-General of the East African Cooperation Secretariat for the region to revive the defunct East</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal - According to the Ugandan state-owned daily Kenyan Foreign Affairs Minister Kilonzo Musyoka had &quot;for the first time admitted over the weekend that it was Kenya which has delayed the appointment of the Secretary-General for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperation Commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several months of consultations between Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania led to formal agreement to launch the bloc in Arusha, Tanzania, in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was the sign that leaders had pushed aside their differences and that the region had finally embarked on an irreversible march to the full revival of the still cherished, but defunct, East African Community,&quot; the Kampala paper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper said &quot;Kenya's foot-dragging attitude towards this cherished goal, threfore, comes a slap in the face of the people of the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burkina Faso, the Le Pays neswpaper focused also on development in Africa commenting that the next visit of the new French head of State would be to some African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How to lay emphasis on democracy in Africa if the vital issue of economic development is not taken into account,&quot; said the paper in a editorial untitled Chirac and Useful Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sticking to the &quot;unavoidable&quot; Paris-Rabat-Dakar-Libreville axis, Chirac had not innovated relations with Africa as his predecessor had done, the paper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like President Francois Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac chose to devote his first African visit to the countries where French interests are paramount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid, the paper said, was conditioned by the strict observance by the Africans of the &quot;injunctions&quot; of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the name of wild liberalism which has created artificial barriers between economic, social, ideological and political issues adjustment plans have contributed to further impoverish the Africans,&quot; it noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daily makes a &quot;critical assessment&quot; of that policy. The Bretton Woods Institutions, it said, &quot;in encouraging export crops mainly to enable poor countries to pay their debts at the expense of food crops, have by the same token made any hope of food security vanish among the populations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cash crops, which are bought at the lowest price, help develop some kind of international trade dominated by the deliberate will of Africa's external partners to get rich to its detriment,&quot; Le Pays concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Dakar daily, commenting on a decision by Zaire's parliament to extend the the transitional period by two extra years, was highly critical of the attitude of &quot; a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">radical opposition claiming for its right (approved by who?) to rule the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all,&quot; Wal Fadjri said, Presidewnt Mobutu Sese Seko demonstrated that westerners &quot;often base their assessment of political situations obtaining in Africa on the stays which they offer to some opponents known for their rhetorical talents which they enjoy displaying in the African programmes of international radios.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal - For the newspaper, &quot;the transition had no effect on (Zairian) political life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economic situation keeps getting worse&quot; fraught with all sorts of possible &quot;dangers&quot;, the independent daily said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the discredit of the political class leave no one in doubt, uncontrolled revolts might well replace the secret talks Mobutu is having with his opposition. Then it would be too late to ensure a smooth transition to democratic institutions,&quot; Wal Fadjri (Dawn, in Arabic) concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the title &quot;Zaire: A New Crisis Defused?&quot;, the Burkina Faso daily Sidwaya observed that this country, which for five years had been shaken by &quot;confusion, social unrest and political crisis&quot; seemed to have escaped a new crisis following the two-year extension of the political transition period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is Prime minister Kengo Wa Dongo going to stand firm in the face of the combined attacks of a coalition of the radical opposition and President Mobutu's barons?&quot; the pro-government Ouagadougou paper wondered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of government, &quot; severely criticised by the opposition&quot;, according to its leading article, will attempt after all to restore the authority of the State in compliance with constitutional rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marshal Mobuutu was &quot;unmovable&quot;, the paper Journal du Jeudi, published in the same city, was happy to point out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With his thirty years of autocratic rule, Mobutu can decide to proclaim himself as the life president or even the emperor of Zaire and very few people would be surprised,&quot; the satirical Burkina Faso weekly added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, the UN Secretary General's African tour could not have passed unnoticed in view of the fact that it is undertaken on the spur of &quot;urgent questions that call for immediate decisions,&quot; according to the Senegalesedaily Le Soleil, quoting Boutros Boutros-Ghali himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon his arrival Thursday afternoon in Kigali, the UN leader could do nothing but to &quot;note the failure, or at least, the total powerlessness of the world body, through the United Nations Mission in Rwanda (MINUAR),&quot; another Dakar-based independent paper, Sud-Quotidien said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This situation was at the origin of the &quot;strong hostility&quot; shown by Kigali towards the 5,500 UN soldiers MINUAR whose withdrawal was being asked by the &quot;regime's strong man &quot;, Paul Kagame, defence minister and vice-president, the paper commented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Soleil said that of the countries Boutros-Ghali was visiting in Africa, none was &quot;conspicuous for its audacity&quot; except perhaps in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daily compared the UN leader's role in Africa to the world body's influence in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali visibly does not feel the war raging in Bosnia,&quot; the paper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The man who, during the initial months of the conflict, had been the focus of the anger of Muslims by castigating what he called &quot;a war of the wealthy&quot;, will not be held in greater esteem after its decision to continue its African tour,&quot; the semi-official Le Soleil added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A Zambian civic pressure group-Forum for Democratic Process (FODEP)- is this month to launch a public debate on the country's draft constitution ahead of its adoption by a Constituent Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FODEP Spokesma, Bishop John Mambo, said in Lusaka Friday that his organisation is currently distributing free copies of the draft in all the country's nine regions to acquaint the public with the proposed constitution before the formal debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure group's first live studio discussion has been scheduled for 18 July in Lusaka for legal practioners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want as many Zambians as possible to understand the proposed constitution and make personal contribution to the final document,&quot; said Mambo today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Frederick Chiluba in November 1993 appointed a constitutional review commission to gather public evidence for a new constitution which he said should be non-partisan and &quot;stand the test of time&quot; and in line with the country's new multiparty political order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission submitted its findings to the president last month after countrywide tours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some sections of the draft constitution have attracted heavy criticism from the opposition led by former President Kenneth Kaunda and other sections of the Zambian community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the most controversial is the proposal that only Zambian-born citizens whose both parents were born in Zambia should in future qualify to hold the office of Republican president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have charged that the clause is specifically aimed at preventing Kaunda to contest the scheduled 1996 Presidential and General elections and that this sparked of discrimination against citizens of immigrant parentage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda, who wants to challenge Chiluba in the forthcoming polls, was last june re-elected to lead his former ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), currently the country's main opposition party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda was born in Zambia by Malawian parents who had come to settle in northern Zambia at the close of the 19th century as missionaries of the Church of Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has vowed to &quot;fight to the bitter end&quot; to block adoption of the discriminatory clause in the final constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba's own ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) had in its submissions to the commission recommended that only &quot;second generation Zambians&quot; should hold the office of president to safeguard national integrity and sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft has yet to be ratified by a Constituent Assembly and possible national referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, traditionalists of the Barotse royal establishment in western region, which is agitating for autonomy, have also threatened to reject the new constitution unless their demand is met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are demanding the restoration of the 1964 &quot;Barotse Agreement&quot; which had guaranteed the area some administrative autonomy and a local treasury for the former British Protectorate in a new independent Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement was signed by Kaunda, the British Foreign Office and the Lozi King as part of the terms for integrating the region into Zambia at independence in 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda had himself abrogated the agreement and the new draft has recommended that Zambia shall remain a unitary state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Benin has become a &quot;wedge for American ideas in Francophones West Africa&quot; and is worthy of closer political and trade ties with America, the U.S. ambassador to that country, Ruth Davis, told reporters Tuesday on the eve of the Beninese President's visit to Washington D.C..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Benin has modeled its government after American models&quot;, Davis was quoted as telling reporters at foreign Press Center in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that is very important because it has given them a different and a broader perspective on issue related to government. I think that will help the country flourish in terms of their effort for creating a very stable democracy&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Wireless File' a news bulletin of the U.S. Information Servie made available to PANA quoted Davis as saying &quot;not only has Benin become a wedge for american ideas in francophone west Africa, it is also a potentially fertile market for U.S. investment and export&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said President Soglo will be seeking more American Investment during his July 12 to 15 Visit, which includes talks with President Bill clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investments in the areas of oil, gas, agriculture, fisheries, and textiles, are especially welcome, Davis noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Benin currently has a &quot;weak industrial base&quot;, Davis told reporters, the country is &quot;working towards solving&quot; all of its problems in that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While having a population of only about five million, Benin is especially important, she stressed, because it stands at the &quot;crossoads between Francophone and Anglophone West Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benin is also important to the United States because it is a longtime ally, closely cooperating with the WAshinton on issues of inportance in the international community and in the areas of cultural links as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the height of the slave trade, one and a half million slaves, at least, were taken from the coast of Benin, that means that in the United States, there is a decisive cultural link with African-Americans and the Beninese, and the Beninese are very proud of that link...&quot;, Davis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want to exploit and encourage trade and cultural relationships that enhance that very important linkage&quot;, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis said benin is especially impressive because &quot;it has taken on economic and political reform -- and has been successful&quot; at streamlining its governement bureaucracy and military, revising its investment codes, improving the management of public finances, and restructuring the country's banking system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After 17 years of a Marxist-Leninist regime, the whole place was in complete collapse... it so collapsed, as a matter of fact, that I think that they were... able to make a peaceful transition (to democracy) -- which is the thing that we are so proud of&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis also said she would like to see more emphasis being given to the success stories in Africa than to the non-success stories adding, &quot;I think we have a success story to tell when we talk about Benin&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Representatives from Angola, Zambia and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are to meet here 20 July to arrange the repatriation of Angolan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR's Representative in Zambia Abou Moussa told PANA Wednesday the three-day meeting will, among other issues, discuss the modalities of the repatriation exercise planned to start in July next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN refugee agency has said there are over 100,000 Angolans in Zambia's Western and Northwestern regions.They left their country to escape a civil war which has been raging since 1975.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 30,000 of them are accommodated at Meheba refugee camp in Northwestern Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moussa had said recently that the success of the repatriation exercise would depend on how seriously the belligerents- the Angolan government and the former rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)- take the peace agreement they signed late in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement brockered by the UN in Lusaka, the warring sides pledged to observe a ceasefire to end almost two decades of civil war since the country's independence from Portugal in 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi has reportedly agreed to become one of the two vice presidents to President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos in a proposed new government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move is part of efforts to foster national reconciliation after the civil war described by the international community as the bloodiest on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over one million Angolans are estimated to have died and thousands maimed in the conflict.The UN says about three million others have been displaced and need immediate humanitarian aid, including food and medicines following the ceasefire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world body is to deploy a 7,500-strong peacekeeping force, including civilians, to oversee the pacification process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Leloko Mohale PANA Staff correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MASERU, Lesotho (PANA) - Visiting South African President Nelson Mandela says closer cooperation between Lesotho and South Africa remains one of the priorities of the Government in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela made the assertion on Wednesday when addressing the Joint Session of the Lesotho parliament shortly after his arrival in the Southern African mountain kingdom, which is completely surrounded by South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President who is on a two-day State visit to Lesotho said both countries need to cooperate closely.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It applies to trade and industry, job creation, economic growth, educational and cultural exchanges, agricultural cooperation, transfer of technology and stability within this region,&quot; Mandela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa was mindful of strife faced by Basotho migrant mineworkers, he said, adding that the risks should be reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For this reason one of the main areas of official south african development assistance to lesotho is in the retraining of retrenched mineworkers,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela said the extradition treaty signed last month between the two countries was just one example of their common resolve to fight crime. This should reinforce the effort of the combined security forces in combating cross border stock theft and drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the multi-billion highlands water project between Lesotho and South Africa stands as a towering example of cooperative infrastructural development. &quot;It will if completed and managed according to plan, bring immense benefits to each country,&quot; he observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesotho and South Africa have joint multi- billion water projects, whereby Lesotho will supply South African industrial heartland of Gauteng province with water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mandela, South Africa was pleased to have been able to contribute, along with other Southern African states, to the peaceful resolution of differences which threatened to undermine democracy in Lesotho last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He thanked the Basotho Nation for the support and understanding of the South African people's struggle. They will not forget the sacrifices that Lesotho had to endure during those years, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the succuor you gave to our sons and daughters, for your solidarity and self-less commitment to our freedom, you paid a fearful price,&quot; Mandela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela is due to meet with political parties later on Wednesday. He departs for home Thursday after laying wreaths at the graves of African National Congress (ANC) members who were brutally killed by the apartheid South African Defence force in Maseru on 9 December 1992.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAZOWE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - President Robert Mugabe said on Wednesday despite progress made so far, Zimbabwe's telecommunications needs are immense and far from being met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe, who was commissioning the Zimdollars 113 million (USD 13.3 million) second Mazowe earth satellite station, said, however, the telephone penetration rate of 1.32 per 100 subscribers was better than that of most African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although our penetration rate of 1.32 is better than the average african telephone density, it is still well below the level required for economic development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eeven after the planned major investment of ZD 6.5 billion (USD 764 million) is realised by the year 2,000, there will still be a gap between supply and demand,&quot; said Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said other means of accelerating investment in the sector had to be found. Mugabe also called on the posts and telecommunications corporation (PTC) to pay attention to the quality of its service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been numerous complaints that our system has too many faults and cases of inaccurate bills and misdirected calls due to crossed lines,&quot; said Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's first earth satellite station was commissioned in August 1985 and operates to the Atlantic ocean's region satellite covering countries in western and central Europe, United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second satellite will enable Zimbabwe to communicate directly with countries in the indian ocean region instead of going through third party countries, an exercise which Mugabe said was expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will now be able to link up directly with astern countries such as Japan, China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia as and when agreements are reached with the governments of these countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The transit costs will now be reduced substantially as direct links are set up with these countries,&quot; said Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the countries of south-east Asia had economic importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are the fastest growing economies in the world and they have managed to break loose from the vicious circle of under development,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the same function, Inforomation, Posts and Telecommunications Minister, David Karimanzira said the PTC had set a target 40,000 lines to be connected in Zimbabwe in the coming calendar year in order to achieve the goals set for the year 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goals included the improvement of the penetration rate to 2.77 telephone lines per 100 by the year 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once achieved, this would wipe out the current waiting list of over 100,000 customers within the same period. thereafter the PTC will be able to supply services on demand,&quot; said Karimanzira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the vision of the PTC was to build a network that not only catered for the basic telephone needs, but also offered a variety of top end commercial services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am confident that this is achievable given the envisaged policy shifts and strategies which have been identified by the corporation,&quot; said Karimanzira.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's foreign ministry has evacuated families of diplomatic staff at its Consulate in Lubumbashi, capital of Zaire's Southern Shaba Region in the wake of reported political disturbances in the area, the official Zambia News Agency (ZANA) has reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It quoted the Pwermanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amon Chibanda as saying that women and children of Zambian diplomatic staff had last saturday been moved to nearby copperbelt region for safety.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chibanda could not immediately give details of the feared troubles of the politically volatile Shaba province but Zambian immigration officials at the northern border post of Kasumbalesa have of late reported of a large influx of zaireans crossing into Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean government in Kinshasa early this year recalled the Shaba governor reportedly following information that he was a sympathiser of a secessionist movement agitating for autonomy for the mineral-rich region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A secession bid in the early 60s by late Moise Tshombe sparked off civil war in the country then known as Belgian Congo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NIAMEY, Niger (PANA) - The Supreme Council on Communication (CSC) in Niger has forbidden any comment on public or private radio stations of statements by political parties, trade unions or associations on ongoing political crisis in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban is to prevent incidents which could &quot;exacerbate the very high social and political tension&quot; or &quot;harm national unity&quot; in the West African State, according to a government statement broadcast Tuesday in Niamey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSC, which regulates public and private media activities, said the ban will last &quot;until the institutional crisis in Niger came to a happy end&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The broadcast recalled that on Thursday last week, the Head of State refused to preside over the Council of Ministers meeting which was to examine appointments of managing directors of public companies and general secretaries in districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refusal was aimed at &quot;blocking&quot; the institutions, &quot;hampering economic recovery, and prevent the signing of agreements with international financial institutions, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In protest against the President's action, Prime Minister Hama Amadou suspended the managing directors appointed by the presidential coalition when it had majority in parliament, in disregard of presidential prerogatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riot police are still on guard at the head offices of several state companies to implement the suspension order issued by the Prime Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament speaker Mahamadou Issoufou, received at an audience Tuesday afternoon by the president, has started mediation efforts between the two parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Mildred Mulenga PANA staff correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka, Zambia (PANA) - The Zambian government Wednesday dissolved the National Health Immunization Committee a day after it ordered the closure of a Technical College, all in a bid to minimize former President Kenneth Kaunda's influence in the polity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Minister Michael Sata charged in Lusaka Wednesday that Kaunda had infiltrated the Immunization Committee and was distorting information on figures of childrens' deaths for political purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former President is said to have obtained figures which showed that more children were dying of malnutrition and preventable diseases in Zambia from a senior member of his United National Independence Party (UNIP) who serves on the Committee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government will take tough measures if Kaunda continues to disturb our programmes,&quot; said Sata who added that the new Committee will now comprise sympathisers of the ruling Movement For Multiparty Democracy (MMD) of President Frederick Chiluba and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday authorities ordered the immediate closure of Northern Technical College (NORTEC) in the northern copperbelt town of Ndola following monday's student's riot, said to have been precipitated by Kaunda's &quot;secret visit&quot; to the institution last June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Lusaka said that Monday's disturbances at the college were mainly caused by an unauthorised visit to the campus by Kaunda on 17 June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement said that investigations by college authorities revealed that student union leaders and Kaunda's party supporters had organised the secret meeting for Kaunda to talk to the students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no details of what Kaunda had told the students who on Monday damaged college property while protesting alleged poor diet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda is campaigning to challenge chiluba in Presidential elections scheduled for 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was recently reported to have said that many Zambian children were dying of malunutrition and other &quot;poverty-related diseases&quot; due to the high cost of living caused by the government's Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda has targetted university and college students including retrenchees, among other groups, in his campaigns promising that he could create jobs for them if he came back to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba's government is pursuing the IMF-driven adjustment involving privatisation and liquidation of government firms which has led to hundreds of workes being thrown out of jobs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - South Africa's Mining Conglomerate, RANGOLD, says it would invest as much as 250,000,000 dollars in its Mining operations in the West African State of senegal, if initial investment in the sector proves rewarding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mineral exploration is a time-consuming venture which requires big money, equipment and Labour&quot;, the company's Managing Director, Mark Brisatow told a Senegalese News Agency (APS) reporter in Dakar at the Week-end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RANGOLD is has been engaged inthe exploration of precious metals at Souroumdou in the Kedougou area of South-Eastern Senegal in collaboration with a local company -- the Senegalese Transaltlantic-West Africa Transport Company (CSTTAO).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial investment in the venture was not specified but could range between 500,000 and 1,000,000 US Dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no activities as conducive to a country's development as the mining sector. If the mining sector develops, the country follows suit&quot;, Bristow said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the company, which entered into an agreement with the Senegalese Government on 24 September 1994, does not rule out the possibility of spending up to 250,000,000 dollars if ongoing operations proved rewarding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bristow said since the positive development of the political situation in his country, he had decided to put his company's century-long experience in mining at the disposal of Partners in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RANGOLD has been studying the Mining laws of Senegal, Mali, Ghana, Cote D'Ivoire, Niger, Guinea and Burkina Faso, where small scale mining had been going on for years with less sophisticated equipment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Contrary to past suspicions that the increase in cases of kidney failure in Sudan was due to overuse of quinine, a doctor has confirmed here the drug actually cures the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pharmacologist at Khartoum University's Faculty of Medicine, Dr Omar Zayed, recently told a medical gathering here that many of the reported kidney failure cases resulted from acute malaria rather than the intensive use of quinine as some people had been led to believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chloroquin is an effective drug for the treatment of malaria and should not be done away with unless the plasmodium virus causing malaria proves to be very resistant to it,&quot;he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After a review of all what had been written about the malarial drugs , I have discovered that none of them causes kidney failure In fact,studies have revealed that kidney failure could be the cause of long-neglected malaria,especially acute malaria,&quot; Dr.Zayed told his audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that quinine was in fact, a life saving medicine in case of malarial complications ,including kidney failures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Zayed further explained that &quot;to save the victim of acute malaria accompanied with kidney failure ,we should give him quinine and only quinine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is contrary to the old theory that quinine causes kidney failure ,&quot; Dr.Zayed told the symposium on &quot;Malaria and The Kidney&quot;, organized by the Association of Sudanese Internist Doctors last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said local studies have proved no direct link between quinine and kidney failures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quinine was in fact found to be very useful and safe in the treatment of patients operated for kidney transplants ,&quot;he asserted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Minister, Ronald Penza, earlier this year pumped in some 8 billion kwacha (About 8 million dollars) into the Meridien to save the cash-strapped financial institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His decision later to merge the troubled bank with the government-owned Zambia National Commercial Bank was rejected by the Cabinet as illegal and ill-advised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cabinet has also directed the Central Bank to retrieve all public funds, estimated by some independent sources at 50 billion kwacha (about 50 Million dollars), from the ill-fated bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An initial audit report published Wednesday said that the bank had been defrauded of 90 billion kwacha (About 90 Million Dollars) partly due to mismanagement. Some fraudulent share-holders were also said to have transferred large sums to unidentified foreign accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Meriedien scandal&quot; had led to calls, from both the opposition and some government leaders for Penza's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba, who some critics have accused of personal collusion with Penza in the bank's saga has not commented on the affair.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwean traditional healers and leaders in Zimbabwe have been urged to spearhead the battle of changing some cultural practices, such as polygamy, to promote safe sexual behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Monday here at a workshop on aids, the Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association (ZINATHA) President, Gordon Chavunduka, said while some local cultural practices, such as widow inheritance, were not easy to discard, they could be modified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-day workshop was convened to facilitate networking among organisations involved in aids prevention and care efforts in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chavunduka said rather than discourage widow inheritance, the use of condoms among such couples could be encouraged and non-sex inheritance can also be advocated for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said instead of trying to stop polygamy, safe sex practices within a polygamous union could be emphasised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZINATHA President said while there were isolated cases of traditional healers charging patients exorbitant consultation fees, many of them charged nothing or very little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the association discouraged its members from charging high prices and those found to be doing so were brought before a disciplinary committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of traditional healers, he said, remained poor because they charged very little for their services, yet they were providing a vital service to the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many traditional healers do not charge at all for their services because they feel they are providing a community service. That is why traditional healers are very poor yet they run &quot;surgeries&quot;, said Chavunduka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the relationship between modern health practitioners and traditional healers had improved, Chavunduka said there was still very little understanding by modern practitioners of the importance of the spiritual dimensions of traditional healing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is the tendency among modern practitioners and academics to ignore or trivialise the spiritual aspects of traditional healers' work,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the difference in opinion regarding the cause of certain illnesses was one of the reasons ZINATHA recently rejected the proposed health professions bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chavunduka said the proposed integration of traditional and modern medicine at the proposed levels would undermine the traditional healers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe Health Ministry has in recent years involved traditional healers in the treatment of aids patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traditional healers later claimed they had reversed some of the aids symptoms among some of the patients they were given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Ministry said none of such patients had tested negative of the HIV virus which leads to aids, after attending clinics run by the healers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudan has accused Egyptian authorities of renewed harassment of its diplomats at the embassy in Cairo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued here Tuesday, Khartoum's Foreign Ministry claimed Egyptian authorities have since Sunday been trailing and threatening the Sudanese military attache and three Counsellors in Cairo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement alleged that an Egyptian securityman deliberately rocked the car of one of the counsellors while he was on his way home .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early last year, Sudan had complained that accused the Egyptian security of provoking and harassing staff at its Cairo embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's statement said &quot;the Egyptian security that used to harass and beat members of the Sudan diplomatic mission in the past,are now taking a new course ,they have started harassing wives of diplomats via telephone calls and by keeping a continuous presence in front of the houses of diplomats and using obsene language whenever they caught sight of any one of the diplomats' wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The &quot;Egyptian regime should shoulder its responsibility towards the security of the Sudanese diplomats and stop those irresponsible provocations immediately,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between Sudan and Egypt have seriously deteriorated since 26 June when an attempt was made to assassinate President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa where he had gone for the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt immediately accused Sudan's islamic government of Gen. Omar Bashir of being behind the plot. Khartoum denied the accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two countries have even exchanged fire along their common border in the Halayib Region whose ownership is still claimed by both.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) has called for increased investment in people, gender equity and equality, saying they are the key factors to achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNFPA said this in a report to mark this year's World Population Day on Tuesday, which stressed the need for more equality between women and men to end poverty and improve the overall standard of living worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document said women should have more control and fewer health risks associated with reproduction and sexuality in order to have better health and the freedom to choose whether and when to have children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Investing in people, in broadening their opportunities and enabling them to realise their potential as human beings is the key to sustained development, as well as to balanced, sustainable population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Empowering women is an important end in itself, as well as a key to improving the quality of life of everyone. without full and equal participation of women, there can be no sustainable human development,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the report is 'Gender Equity and Reproductive Health', concepts which were central to the agreement reached in cairo at last year's International Conference on Population and Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gender equity and reproductive health are expected to be high on the agenda of the Fourth World Conference on Women to be held in Beijing, China, in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While levels of education had risen and the gap between males and females narrowed, there were still 960 million illiterate people worldwide, of which two thirds were women and some 130 million children, including some 90 million girls who were denied access to primary education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said there should be equal access to training, credit, property, natural resources, education and better-paying jobs between men and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These inequalities must be redressed to fulfil women's human rights and enable countries to progress towards sustainable development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Towards this end, all forms of discrimination should be outlawed and opposed in civic life, traditional laws and practices which enforce women's subordination must be challenged,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said there was need to set a minimum age of marriage to protect young women from dangers of early child-bearing and allow them to take advantage of options beyond motherhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most developing countries women often have one role in society, which is reproduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said one way to empower women was through education, which is &quot;the most important intervention to break the vicious cycle of low status, poverty and large families</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a direction connection between education for girls and women's ability to escape from poverty, education also encourages later marriage and greater use of contraception.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an EIB release made available to PANA, the loan will help execute the first phase of a project tagged 'lion panther' involving oil wells discovered some 13 km off the shores of Abidjan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire project is estimated to cost 156 million ecu (about 194 million dollars) of which Petroci is expected to provide 54 milion ecu, the release said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from eib's contribution, Petroci's participation is being met with 13.5 million ecu from Citibank Abidjan and the West African Development Bank, and 10,5 million ecu from Petroci's own resources, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Established in 1958 by the Treaty of Rome, the EIB finances capital investment projects which further European Union policy objectives among member-satates and within the 70 Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states associated to the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development of the Ivorian oil and gas gas deposits will enable Abidjan to reduce imports resulting in substantial savings of foreign exchange.  Furthermore, the use of gas to generate electricity will help bring down costs and foster the government's economic recovery plan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (pana) - Ethiopian authorities have ordered foreigners who entered the country illegally to report to the Department of Immigration and Refugee Affairs within 30 days, warning that legal action would be taken against those who fail to meet the deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many foreigners who entered the country illegally and live in the country without permission or without going through the proper procedures&quot;, the department said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that foreigners living in Addis Ababa, the capital, were involved in business activities without acquiring licences or paying tax.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement carried over state radio Monday night did not give any reasons for the order, but warned that strict measures would be taken against those who were involved in activities that contravene the laws of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say the order may not be unconnected with the failed attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak when he arrived in the Ethiopian capital to attend a summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) on 26 June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the gunmen who sprayed Mubarak's armour-plated car with bullets were killed on the spot along with two Ethiopian security agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa said days later that three other suspected assailants were killed during a gun battle with police in their hide-out on the outskirts of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopian authorities said all the five gunmen killed were Egyptians adding that it was not clear how they entered the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement also warned Ethiopians against doing business with foreigners without valid residence or business permits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 10 - 12, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editorial -- Uganda's coffee industry is in shock because of the bad news from world market that the price of the commodity has suddenly collapsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday (July 7) the London Commodity Exchange closed with coffee futures down to $2,080 (Shs 2m) a tonne from a nine-month high of $4,140 (Shs 4m).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the Uganda Coffee Exporters Association Executive Director, Frederick Mulimira Kawuma, put a brave face to this disaster when he said that the plunge in prices was temporary, only a repeat of last year's drought and frost in Brazil can turn prices around. Unfortunately, so far, the speculators have been confounded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To compound the problem at the moment, Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, and Columbia, another significant Latin American producer, don't want to hear anything about managing prices by the producers cartel. And without the two, any hopes of shoring up prices through stringent quotas application are dashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This collapse should be an eye opener to the government which has been lately crowing about Uganda being the thirteenth fastest growing economy in the developing world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That phenomenal statistic was partly the result of the windfall raked in by coffee exports. It is more likely that the following year Uganda may drop off that top 15 UN listing -- of go up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sustainable growth cannot rest on the mercies of weather. Our economy is still too susceptible to natural disasters. For example, in fiscal year 1993/94, the drought and famine in the East and the North poured water on growth trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not even certain that Uganda's efforts to privatise and attract foreign investors will bear handsome dividends. Most investors are out for a quick return on their capital because long-term political and economic stability -- in Uganda as in most of Africa -- is shaky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bureaucratic red tape and the still poor state of basic infrastructure such as electricity and communication are still serious hurdles for investors. And unlike the economies of Southeast Asia where skilled labour is an investment attraction, here we can only offer &quot;cheap&quot; but unskilled manpower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quick relief will therefore not come from praying for the next frost in Brazil or waiting for capital inflows from abroad. It is imperative that government pursues policies that encourage value-adding processing and manufacturing industries which will suffer less the consequences of price fluctuations in the international market.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 30 - July 3, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Peter G. Mwesige and Kyazze Simwogerere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constituent Assembly -- with the multipartyists still boycotting it -- passed an amendment that provides for the Movement political system to apply for the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendment (an insertion now article 99) also provides for a referendum to determine which political system the people of Uganda want to adopt after the five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 99 (1) says that: &quot;Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 94 the first Presidential, Parliamentary, Local Government and any other Public elections after the promulgation of this Constitution shall be held under the Movement Political System. (2) Two years before the expiry of the term of the first Parliament elected under this Constitution, any person will be free to canvass for support for any political system he or she supports. (3) During the last month of the fourth year of the term of office of the first Parliament, a referendum shall be held to determine the political system the people of Uganda want to adopt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This final version was improved by Lt. Col. Kiiza Besigye (NRA), Janat Mukwaya (Mukono South) and Ogwel Loote (Moroto).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amama said that the CA determines the political system for the next five years because the Odoki Commission had found out that Ugandans wanted the movement to continue for that period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no problem with a referendum now but since the people of Uganda have expressed themselves already, I find it absolutely unnecessary to go back and ask for their views in a referendum when we know their views,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have sufficient time to organise a referendum unless the NRC extended the NRM, but this is not likely to be supported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amama said Clause (2) and (3) were necessary to level the ground, because there are some people who say they are not free enough today to influence events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Movement should be operational for three years without encumbrances then open up in the last two years. This is a time-table,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although almost all those present were professed Movementists, there were quite a few voices of unease, with many delegates wondering whether the article was not a transitional matter and therefore, for Chapter 20, while others worried that the time given for canvassing was too short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering to the queries raised about whether NRM was going to continue after the elections, Amama said that it was a Movement political system and not NRM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 99 became part of the new constitution, pending the completion of chapter 20, its likely new home.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 17, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Wale Akin Aina</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the arrest of Gani Fawehinmi for undisclosed reasons, politicians respond to the lifting of the ban on politics with enthusiasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest of Gani Fawehinmi, maverick lawyer and leader of the National Conscience Party, NCP, and moves by political associations to secure alliances and mergers dominated the political scene most of last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fawehinmi, according to a statement for his law chambers was picked at about 9 p.m. July 3 by officers of the State Security Service, SSS. The statement said that the security agents presented no warrant of arrest or a search warrant and offered no reason for his arrest. It adds that by his arrest government had clearly shown that &quot;it has not genuinely lifted the ban on political activities.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there has been no statement from either the government or any of its security agencies, it would appear that Fawehinmi is the first political leader to fall victim of the new ground rules on politicking set by Sani Abacha, the head of state, at the presentation of the draft constitution, June 27. Abacha had announced the lifting of the ban on politics but placed restrictions on political rallies and campaigns. He warned against reckless and provocative utterances. He said the restrictions would remain until a comprehensive political programme is announced in October by the National Electoral Commission, NEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fawehinmi addressed a world press conference July 2 at which he questioned the rationale for the lifting of the ban without allowing political rallies and campaigns. He said he would defy the ban by holding rallies of his political party. He used the press conference to attack the military government. His statement was broadcast on the BBC the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neither Fawehinmi's arrest not the restrictions placed by Abacha on political activities appeared to have dampened the enthusiasm of politicians.  Politicians criss-crossed the country last week, solidifying positions and establishing new contacts. Sources spoke of conclusive plans by progressives to form a grand alliance. A meeting of progressives was scheduled for July 12. Political associations expected at the meeting include the New Dimension, The Eastern Mandate Union (EMU), The Eastern Solidarity Front, the Egbe Omo Yoruba, the resurrected Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) and the Committee of the Afenifere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time an attempt will be made to bring progressives together since the government partially lifted the ban on politics last year.  After a series of meetings, the Afenifere led by Adekunle Ajasin, former governor of Ondo State, and the NEPU led by Balarabe Musa, former governor of Kaduna State, met in Owo last May and agreed on an alliance. They agreed to fight for the resolution of the annulled presidential election of June 12, 19934 and the release from detention of Moshood Abiola, the man presumed to have won the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also last year, the Afenifere and the All Nigeria Congress (ANC) began meeting after the partial lifting of the ban on politics. Participants at the meetings were Ahmed Kusamatu, former chairman of the defunct National Republican Convention (NRC); Sunday Awomiyi, former vice-chairman in the defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN); Bamanga Tukur and Adamu Ciroma, former ministers of industries and agriculture respectively and Lema Jibrilu, former presidential aspirant. Others who represented the Afenifere were Bola Ige, former governor of Oyo State, Olu Falae, former secretary to the Federal government and Ganiyu Dawodu, a top member of the defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Lagos State. The two associations were to meet in Owo July 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Southern Solidarity Forum was also to meet in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, the following day to discuss issues associated with the draft constitution. The meeting was to be hosted by Tunji Otegbeye, a member of the constitutional conference commission and would include representatives form both the Middle Belt and the Northern Elders Forums. Sources said that the meeting would focus on the issue of rotational presidency and revenue allocation and the threat by certain sections of the country to delete the relevant provisions from the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the self-styled &quot;concerned elders&quot; group of Musa Karaye, Aminu Idris, Baba Saleh and Baba Karah wrote to the head of state complaining about rotational presidency, revenue allocation and the reduction in size of the armed forces. The &quot;concerned elders&quot; had, at the federal appeal court in Kaduna, appealed against the ruling of the Abuja high court which had thrown out their suit to stop the draft constitution from being submitted to the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC). While the &quot;concerned elders&quot; were still battling to remove certain provisions, the government has ordered that 50,000 copies of the document be printed for distribution in all the states. This is in line with Abacha's statement that the draft constitution be studied within the three months which the PRC would take to decide on the new political programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said last week that the new political programme would probably take off with elections into local governments on a zero-party basis. This has made politicians, especially conference delegates who want to go into politics a bit confused about the emerging political arrangement. At the reception organised for them after the presentation of the draft constitution, Abacha gave the indication that government was favourably considering statements by Adolphus Karibi-Whyte, the conference chairman and Mamman Nasir, his deputy, that delegates were still willing to serve the country in any capacity. The head of state did not dissolve the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, some politicians and delegates do not know whether to go all out into politics and miss out on what the government might have in store for them. One delegate told Newswatch: &quot;not participating in any local government election or losing one's ward is a sure way of sealing off one's political career in the coming republic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order not to be caught unawares, some political associations have begun to restructure their party hierarchy. The Committee for National Consensus (CNC), announced last week the appointment of Abel Ubeku, a conference delegate and former presidential aspirant, as its new chairman. Other officers of the association are Olusola Saraki, former senator and chairman of the conference business committee; Jibrilu Aminu, former Petroleum resources minister and Barnabas Gemade, former secretary of works in the Interim National Government, both are conference delegates. Others were Don Etiebet, former petroleum resources minister, Sunday Adewusi, former inspector-general of police and Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, publisher of the Champion newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CNC also divided the country into six zones -- North-West, Central, Eastern, Western, Southern and North-Eastern for administrative convenience and to ensure enhanced party functions. Similar structures had earlier been adopted by the Afenifere at its August 31 meeting in Ibadan last year and by the Movement for National Reconciliation (MNR), led by Anthony Enahoro, a pro-democracy activist and former information minister.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 5, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Ibrahim Janko Sanneh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) Government is committed to the advancement of women who constitute nearly half of the human capital, and contribute immensely to the socio-economic development of the country.  The chairman of the AFPRC and Head of State of the Republic of The Gambia, Captain Yahya Jammeh, has recognised this fact as expressed by him in various fora across the length of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were the remarks made by the Minister for Local Government and Lands, Captain Yankuba Touray, to more than 100 women at the opening of a four-day workshop at the Rural Development Institute in Mansakonko, Lower River Division in late June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop, which had two main items on the agenda, brought women representatives from all over the country, from Koina in the east to Kartung in the west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It aimed at the making of a women policy document that would be presented to the government for eventual inclusion in the constitution of the country, and to prepare women representatives who would be in Beijing, China on behalf of the rest of The Gambia women in September of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister said the workshop was timely as it proposed to address two critical issues about women's participation in socio-economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such issue is the democratisation process in which women are given the opportunity by Government to take part in national debate towards the development of the desired structures for a more democratic and just society for all as preparation is made for the Second Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second important issue affecting the workshop was the finalisation of the country's paper to Beijing. The Minister said for the AFPRC government, Beijing would be a conference with a difference. The Government had already started to undertake certain actions that are in link with the Beijing Global Platform of Action for the Advancement of Women in the 2005. A notable example being the appointment of four women cabinet ministers out of fourteen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all know,&quot; he said, &quot;that a lot of service has been paid on the advancement and empowerment of women by the old regime, but this attitude has no place in the society which the AFPRC has vowed to promote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of Health, Social Welfare and Women's Affairs, Cumba Ceesay Marenah, who chaired the opening, expressed the hope that participants would coherently discuss issues in preparation for the Second Republic and also for the trip to Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amie Joof-Cole, the chairperson of the national Women's Council, in her vote of thanks, said the AFPRC government has established its interests in the advancement of women's affairs in different forms. She advised the women that their role in politics should not stop them from playing the roles of passengers in the next Republic. They should aim at being in the front seats and driving at the wheels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop was jointly organized by WID, National Women's Council, Ministry of Health, Social Welfare and Women's Affairs and UNDP.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Alieu Badara Njie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), have denied rumours that there is a shortage of basic commodities in the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a press release from the GCCI, &quot;no shortage of rice or any essential commodity has been recorded.&quot; The release also states that the price fluctuations affecting these commodities &quot;is a pure reflection of world market conditions which are solely determined by market forces and therefore outside of the control of the business community.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release stressed that despite mounting difficulties, the GCCI &quot;will continue to exert maximum effort to ensure that essential commodities such as rice, sugar, flour, tomato paste and cooking oil are available in the market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also issued statistics which reveal that a total of 74,200 tonnes of rice had been imported in The Gambia by members of the GCCI fro July 1994 to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This constitutes 84 per cent of total rice imports for the same period,&quot; shipped in by the Rice Consortium and T. Massry and Sons, the release adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release however notes that &quot;the Chamber will not comment on the dumping of rice as it is 'sub judice'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other statistics contained in the release indicate that from July, 1994 to May, 1995, other basic commodities such as sugar (20,000 tonnes), flour (25,000 tonnes), cooking oil (1,150 tonnes), and tomato paste (3,660 tonnes) were imported into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release concludes: &quot;The Chamber of Commerce and Industry regrets any false alarm or misinformation that may have sent wrong signals to the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) 25 July - The Archbishop of South Africa, Rt. Rev. Desmond Tutu, is scheduled to visit Burundi and Rwanda on a mission to support the reconciliation efforts in the two countries. The visit beginning Thursday 27th through Monday 30 July, is organised by the churches in both countries jointly with the Africa Evangelistic Enterprise (AEE).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu who is also the current President of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) with a membership of over 140 Churches and associate National Christian Councils (NCCs) in more than 38 African countries, will arrive in Burundi from Nairobi on July 27 at the head of an AACC delegation to consult with church leaders on the role of the Church in the process of national reconciliation. The delegation will include Micheal Cassidy, Vice-President of AEE. Bishop Tutu will be in Nairobi for a day to address the World Future Studies Conference on Wednesday July 26.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Burundi, Bishop Tutu will preach at different churches on issues related to reconciliation. His sermons will culminate in a public rally and prayers for the nation in the national stadium in Burundi's capital, Bujumbura. He will focus on the general theme &quot;Christ our Hope&quot;. Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize Winner, will also meet with top political leaders, including the Burundian President, Sylvestre Ntibatunganya and Prime Minister, Mr. Antoine Nduwayo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Tutu will then proceed to Rwanda on Saturday July 29, on a similar mission where he will address a public rally in Kigali on Sunday 30 July.  Tutu's visit to Rwanda comes just one year after the genocide that cost an estimated 500,000-1,000,000 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Tutu will be visiting Burundi and Rwanda for the first time since he became President of the AACC in 1987. The AACC has engaged in peace initiatives in Burundi and Rwanda since 1988 and 1991 respectively. Working behind the scenes, the AACC played a major role in brokering the 1983 Arusha peace accord between the ruling Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) and the then government of Major General Juvenal Habyrimana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Habyarimana died in a mysterious plane crash on April 6, 1994 along side his Burundian counterpart President Cyprien Ntaryamira, sparking off the genocide in Rwanda, before the Accord could be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Jose Chipenda, AACC General Secretary said: &quot;The African Churches wish to show their solidarity with the suffering people of Rwanda and Burundi and to encourage them to reconcile for the good of Africa and for the sake of present and future generations in those countries&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATLANTA, GA.Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said today upon returning from a trip to Sudan that all sides in that nation's civil conflict had agreed to continue observing the cease-fire as long as good faith talks are being held under the auspices of the Inter-governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD), chaired by Kenya President Daniel Arap Moi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cease-fire, originally set to expire July 28, has allowed international health workers to implement interventions to prevent Guinea worm disease, river blindness, and other diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trip, President Carter delivered peace talk invitations from President Moi to the Sudanese government, Sudanese People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), and the Southern Sudanese Independence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Movement/Army (SSIM/A). All sides accepted the invitations for peace talks to begin soon in Nairobi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All sides agreed to continuation of the four-month cease-fire as long as significant progress was being made toward achieving a lasting peace,&quot; President Carter said. &quot;They all also expressed concern about the fundamental issues that continue to divide them and agreed to discuss several principles when talks begin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Principles for talks outlined in the invitation were:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) maintenance of a general cease-fire during these peace talks;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) the general forms of government for Sudan;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) how political authority will be shared or divided;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d) the make-up of military forces and their status;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e) the sharing or division of regional resources;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">f) the length of an interim period during which these issues will be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finalized; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">g) participants who will represent the Inter-governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) and the Sudanese parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Carter stressed that the 72 Sudanese government soldiers taken prisoner in late March shortly after the cease-fire declaration was an issue of great concern to the Sudanese government and that he will continue to press for their release as part of the peace process. He also emphasized the importance of opening up to relief and health workers airfields to which the Sudanese government had denied access, and he expressed hope that U.N.  Special Envoy Traxler will be able to resolve this and other areas of disagreement between the government and Operation Lifeline Sudan at a meeting scheduled for the end of this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Carter said the Government of Sudan, the SPLM/A, and the SSIM/A all supported expanding the health initiatives during a continued cease-fire.  &quot;I was pleased that all sides in the Sudanese conflict praised the significant accomplishments of the health projects that began in late March.  Access to many areas in the country has been possible only during the last four months of relative peace, and the coordinated work of more than 20 relief agencies is truly heroic,&quot; President Carter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Progress made during the past four months includes interventions to: prevent Guinea worm in 2,336 villages; treat at least 40,000 persons with the drug Mectizan to prevent river blindness; vaccinate 35,000 people for polio and 40,000 for measles; and distribute 35,000 doses of vitamin A and 9,000 packets of oral rehydration supplements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a continued cease-fire, The Carter Center plans a much wider health program throughout the nation that also will include interventions to prevent malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, sleeping sickness, and other tropical diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Center also will explore re-establishing a highly successful agricultural project through The Carter Center's Global 2000 Program that was interrupted in 1992 by the civil war.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 14, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Representatives has reduced appropriations for the Development Fund for Africa (DFA) for Fiscal Year 1996 from the $802 million proposed by the administration to $529.5 million, a cut of $272.5 million. House actions also cut the proposed $17.4 million for the African Development Foundation (ADF) to $10 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these figures are still subject to Senate action, and to subsequent compromises, different proposals in the Senate range from almost equally drastic to worse. Meanwhile in a June authorization vote on the defense budget, the House approved $550 million for initial funding for production of two additional B-2 bombers not requested by the Pentagon, more than the combined DFA and ADF appropriations. Each additional B-2 bomber produced will cost an estimated $1.5 billion. The vote, accompanied by intense lobbying by military contractors and former Defense officials, pitted strict budget cutters and opponents of high military spending against not only the usual Defense Department boosters in Congress but also some members heavily influenced by considerations of potential job losses in their districts. Yet the proposed funding for the B-2 program could cover continued support for human needs at home as well as for sustainable development programs in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following alert, prepared by the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) for a coalition opposing the B-2 funding, is therefore relevant for supporters of Africa as well. House consideration of the appropriations bill is likely to come up before the end of the month, and perhaps as early as the week of July 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For additional information, please be in touch with FCNL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHONE CALLS NEEDED ON B-2 BOMBER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives John Kasich (R-OH) and Ron Dellums (D-CA) will be offering an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill to block funding for additional B-2 bombers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A previous vote was close, and there are many members whose positions might be changed. Phone calls are needed immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives Kasich and Dellums offered a similar amendment to the Defense Authorization bill. In a frustrating vote, the amendment was defeated by the very narrow margin of 203 to 219. A number of representatives who normally support arms control efforts voted AGAINST the amendment and FOR the B-2. The (Kasich-Dellums) amendment would have removed a provision from the authorization bill that gets rid of the current cap on B-2 production (a 20-plane, $44 billion limit). The provision also authorizes $533 million to be spent on parts and production costs for 2 more planes. The cost of these planes was based on the assumption that 20 more B-2s would bebuilt. So by voting to retain this provision, the committee was implicitly approving 20 more planes, at an eventual costs of over $31.5 billion. THE PENTAGON DID NOT REQUEST THESE PLANES. THEY ARE NOT AN AIR FORCE PRIORITY. This money could be spent on many other things, but pork barrel politics won out and Northrup's slick lobbying materials paid off. WE CAN STILL STOP THE B-2, though. Kasich and Dellums will try to block funds from being appropriated for the B-2. And in the Senate, Sen. Cohen (R-ME) introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill in committee. The amendment passed, 13-8, so there is currently no money for the B-2 in the Senate's version of the authorization bill.Please call as many of the offices listed below as is possible. Ask to speak with the defense aide. Try to cover at least the following basic points:- YOUR ORGANIZATION (OR YOU) OPPOSES PRODUCTION OF THE B-2.- YOU WANT THE REPRESENTATIVE TO VOTE FOR THE KASICH-DELLUMS AMENDMENT AND AGAINST FUNDING OF THE B-2 BOMBER.- THE PENTAGON AND THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT REQUEST THESE FUNDS.- TO SPEND THIS MONEY ON THE B-2 AT A TIME WHEN HUMAN NEEDS, DISARMAMENT, CONVERSION, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER IMPORTANT PROGRAMS ARE BEING SLASHED IS INDEFENSIBLE.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2707 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa has released a new report with first-hand evidence of military repression in the Ogoni region of Nigeria, including interviews with military personnel. The trial of Ogoni leader Ken Saro-Wiwa by a special tribunal is continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excerpts from the HRW/Africa press release announcing the report follows below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian military government has been engaged in a systematic and violent crackdown in the Ogoni region of the oil-rich Niger Delta, where indigenous communities have organized in protest against multinational oil companies. In The Ogoni Crisis: A Case Study of Military Repression in Southeastern Nigeria, Human Rights Watch/Africa focuses on the most recent phase of the repression, which began in late May 1994, following the murders of four Ogoni leaders believed to have been pro-government. Human Rights Watch/Africa charges that the Rivers State Internal Security Task Force embarked on a series of punitive raids on Ogoni villages, resulting in extrajudicial executions, shootings, arbitrary arrests, floggings, rapes and looting which violate Nigeria's obligations under international law and the Nigerian Constitution. The new 50-page report also documents attacks by the security forces on other indigenous communities in the Niger Delta, where local residents have begun to emulate the Ogonis' well- organized protests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ogoni people and other communities in the Delta contend that multinational oil companies, particularly the Shell Petroleum Development Company, in concert with the Nigerian government, have ravaged their land and contaminated their rivers. Shell officials have admitted requesting assistance from the Nigerian military authorities to defend the company's installations. Although oil production in Ogoniland was suspended in mid-1993, the abuses set in motion by Shell's reliance on military protection there continue. Based on its investigation in Nigeria and an ongoing discussion with Royal Dutch/Shell, Human Rights Watch/Africa has devised a set of basic human rights principles, presented in the report, and calls on the multinational oil companies to adhere to them in the course of their business operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), led by Ken Saro-Wiwa, has been at the forefront of the confrontation between the indigenous communities of the Niger Delta, the oil companies and the government. Mr. Saro-Wiwa and other Ogoni activists were detained and are currently on trial before a three-member special tribunal appointed by the Federal Military Government of Nigeria. The tribunal, which has the authority to impose the death penalty, lacks independence and impartiality and has been the subject of intense international criticism. Faced with increasing evidence of the tribunal's bias against the defendants, the defense team has reportedly decided to withdraw from Saro-Wiwa's case -- to avoid &quot;glorifying the tribunal which is set up for a pre-determined purpose,&quot; according to one defense lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During its three-week mission to Nigeria this year, Human Rights Watch/Africa also gathered the first-ever testimony from soldiers who were themselves involved in the military's punitive campaign in Ogoniland.  Soldiers described their participation in clandestine military raids designed to appear like communal clashes that would support the government's fraudulent contention that the violence in the region was the product of ethnic strife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch offers a series of recommendations to the Nigerian government, the international community and the multinational oil companies in order to improve the human rights situation in Nigeria. Human Rights Watch/Africa calls on the Government of Nigeria to: 1. Order the Rivers State Internal Security Task Force to cease immediately extrajudicial executions, indiscriminate shooting, arbitrary arrests and detention, floggings, rapes, looting, and extortion; 2. Disband the special tribunal established to try those accused of the May 21, 1994 murders of four Ogoni leaders; 3.  Facilitate the immediate and unconditional release of all detainees held solely for he non-violent expression of their political beliefs, drop all politically motivated charges against them, and cease arbitrary detention without charge; 4. Convene an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the May 21, 1994 murders; 5. Insofar as credible evidence exists for any defendants accused of complicity in legally recognizable crimes, try them within a reasonable time before a competent, independent, and impartial court in compliance with Nigeria's obligations under international human rights law and the Nigerian Constitution; 6. Convene independent commissions of inquiry to investigate the actions of the Internal Security Task Force in Ogoniland and as yet uninvestigated attacks on other oil-producing communities; 7. Publicly prosecute in accordance with international standards all members of the Nigerian security forces who are implicated in violent human rights abuses; 8. Pending conclusion of the prosecutions, suspend members of the security forces implicated in violent human rights abuses; 9.  Open Ogoniland to independent observers and human rights monitors, who should be allowed unimpeded access to the area without military escort; 10. Open the Kpor and Bori detention centers to independent monitors and ensure that detention conditions are consistent with international standards; 11. Provide relief, rehabilitation, and resettlement assistance to residents of oil-producing areas who have suffered losses in government-sponsored attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa recommends that the international community press the Nigerian government to implement the above recommendations through public criticism, active monitoring of political trials, and policies of aid and trade. In particular: Member States of the European Union should adopt a legally binding common position, in accordance with Article J.2 of the Treaty of Maastricht, incorporating some of those measures already agreed upon as &quot;politically binding,&quot; namely: suspension of military cooperation; visa restrictions for members of the military and security forces who are reliably accused of participation in human rights abuses; suspension of visits by members of the military and intelligence service; imposition of case-by-case review, with a presumption of denial, for all new export license applications for defense equipment; cancellation of training courses for all Nigerian military personnel; review of new European Union aid projects on a case-by-case basis; and suspension of all non-essential high-level visits to and from Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union and its member states should also promote compliance by the Nigerian government with international human rights standards by: 1.  Pressing the Nigerian government to implement the above recommendations; 2.  Publicly naming those members of the Nigerian government to whom visas are denied as a result of their complicity in human rights violations; 3.  Freezing all foreign assets of members of the Nigerian government who are responsible for serious human rights violations; 4. Moving beyond case-by-case review, with a presumption of denial, for export license applications for defense equipment to embargoes on the sale and shipment of arms to the Nigerian government; 5. Using their leverage in the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and other international financial institutions to block all non-&quot;basic human needs&quot; loans and disbursements to Nigeria; 6.  Publicly raising the issue of political prisoners with the Nigerian government and making efforts to visit prisoners in detention; 7. Sending observers to the trials of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other MOSOP activists charged with the May 21, 1994 murders; 8. Urging their embassies to support the efforts of Nigerian human rights groups by meeting regularly with Nigerian human rights activists and issuing statements condemning human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States should promote compliance by the Nigerian government with international human rights standards by: 1. Pressing the Nigerian government to implement the above recommendations; 2. Rigorously enforcing the existing policy of denying visas to Nigerians who formulate or implement policies impeding a transition to democracy in Nigeria or who benefit from such policies, as well as the immediate families of such persons; 3. Rigorously enforcing the existing policy of case-by-case review of commercial military sales, with the presumption of denial, and moving beyond this policy to an embargo of all arms sales and shipments to Nigeria. 4. Implementing other policies consistent with those recommended for the European Union and its member states. (Similar measures are called for by Commonwealth member states, African governments and the United Nations.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa calls on Royal Dutch/Shell and other multinational oil companies operating in Nigeria to adhere to a set of basic human rights principles in the course of their business operations. By virtue of their influence in Nigeria and their participation in joint ventures in which the government is a principal stakeholder, the multinational oil companies are well placed to convey their concern about Nigeria's rapidly deteriorating human rights record in the course of their business dealings with local, state, and federal authorities. Because the Nigerian security forces have often employed grossly abusive measures to quell protests by residents of oil-producing areas against the activities of the multinational oil companies, the oil companies have a particular responsibility to address abuses perpetrated in this context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa encourages the multinational oil companies to: 1.  Appoint responsible high-ranking corporate officials to monitor the use of force by the Nigerian military in the oil-producing areas and to denounce the use of unjustified or excessive force; 2. Urge the Nigerian government to allow nonviolent freedom of association and expression, particularly with respect to grievances directed against the oil industry; 3. Publicly and privately call upon the Nigerian government to restrain the use of armed force in the oil-producing aras; 4. Publicly and privately condemn human rights abuses by the Nigerian security forces in the areas where the companies are operating; 5. Urge the Nigerian government to cease arbitrary detention of peaceful protesters and to release all individuals held for the nonviolent expression of their political beliefs; 6.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trip to South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive Summary: Findings and Recommendations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 1995 The Africa Fund organized a visit by three state legislators to South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. This delegation visit was part of a project, made possible by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, to promote the involvement of U.S. state and municipal officials with U.S.  policy towards southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State and municipal elected officials in the United States played a critical role in influencing U.S. foreign policy toward apartheid South Africa in the 1980s. Many worked closely with the Africa Fund, frequently turning to it for information and analysis. In the aftermath of South African liberation, leading legislators wanted to maintain their involvement but recognized the need to become familiar with the new issues facing the wider southern Africa region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Delegation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were privileged to have a team of three distinguished state legislators in this first delegation. Representative Arthur Hamilton of Arizona, Representative Irma Hunter Brown of Arkansas and Senator Virgil Clark Smith of Michigan have over fifty-four years of legislative experience between them, a period far longer than the nations they visited have lived in freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dumisani Kumalo, Projects Director of The Africa Fund, accompanied the delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each country visited, the delegation sought to gain an in-depth understanding of the current situation, assessing the changes taking place.  They planned to initiate strong contacts with local legislators and exchange legislative experiences and knowledge about drafting laws, constructing budgets and raising revenues. In addition to meeting many individuals, the delegation participated in a number of specially organized regional working forums with legislators in several centers in each country, making formal presentations and engaging in extended dialogue with their counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trying to share the current economic pie with everyone while hurting no one will not be possible. Explaining these facts to all South Africans while making none of them unhappy will not be possible.&quot; -- Arthur Hamilton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africa Fund delegation chose to visit three countries as a means of widening the near total American focus on South Africa to encompass the broader region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together, South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe reflect the diversity of southern Africa's experience with freedom. South Africa has only been free for a year. Namibia, long illegally occupied by South Africa as a colony, won its independence in 1990. Zimbabwe achieved liberation fifteen years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Common Problems - Challenges Being Met</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more striking than their differences are the continuing, severe common problems produced by many decades of apartheid, colonial and white minority rule which the delegation observed, in varying degrees, in all three countries visited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegation members were struck by the overwhelming disparity between the haves and have-nots, with the pattern, throughout the region, of continuing white wealth and Black poverty. Fifteen years after independence, Senator Smith points out, almost 70 percent of Zimbabwe's Black population lives in rural areas and is mainly engaged in subsistence agriculture, while most commercial agriculture is still controlled by whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegation member welcomed the commitment to democracy they found throughout the region, and were impressed by the determination of local legislators to strengthen their capacity to act effectively on behalf of their constituencies. But they warn that the almost complete lack of economic resources, and thus the inability of either central or local government to deliver even such basic needs as adequate schools, sewage and running water poses a serious threat to the building of peaceful, stable democratic societies. As Art Hamilton says of South Africa, at the beginning of his report, &quot;There is a perception in the United States that Mandela is President, the majority rules and democracy is secure. A nice thought but not the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation was frequently asked to discuss issues relating to affirmative action -- which is broadly used to mean overcoming all the inequities, of wealth, education, skills, access to employment, that still characterize daily living for most members of the Black majority in all three countries visited. People long discriminated against, particularly in South Africa, but across the region, are understandably impatient for radical improvements in their lives. They want better jobs, homes and opportunities.  The delegation observed that these reasonable desires, unmet, may lead to a loss of confidence in the democratic process. In some ways legitimacy of government is pitted in a race with popular expectations and it will be very important for the people to win some prizes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been personally touched by returning to the countries of my ancestors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Virgil Smith</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa the delegation was impressed by the idea of the government of national unity and the thrust for reconciliation. But they report frequent signs, in all three countries, of a continued reluctance on the part of the economically privileged white minority to share resources in ways that would most swiftly address Black dispossession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the region the delegation found an eagerness for open discussion, particularly about ways in which democratic participation, popular, local and at national level, could be strengthened and economic progress encouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation also found an eagerness for greater connection and contact with the U.S. Members have made several individual observations about ways this might be achieved and the mutual benefits that such links could generate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time the delegation underscored the importance of responding to the agenda's being set within each country: As Art Hamilton comments, &quot;The people we met ... want our help, our assistance and our guidance. But they clearly do not want to be dictated to, or told the best way to do things....&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without in any way wishing to prescribe for the countries they visited the delegation felt that the youngest democracy might in some ways be able to benefit from observing the Namibian and Zimbabwean experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The individual delegation reports stress the importance of perspectives provided by direct contact and communication. Delegation members felt such contact could be usefully expanded. As Irma Hunter Brown comments on her experience : &quot;It is my ... hope that the dialogue ... will develop into long term relationships. I think much can be learned and much can be shared which can benefit us all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation was excited by the widespread mood of optimism, the willingness to experiment, the enthusiasm they found among most of the elected officials and community leaders they met. Challenges are being met.  They see the region as a potential anchor for democracy in Africa with a potential for great economic growth. In this context they urge greater U.S.  public and private engagement and investment. In Art Hamilton's words, &quot;We now have an opportunity to help secure democracy in a part of the world that colonial rule made a powder keg. With the rapid growth of the African nations a relatively small investment now will pay huge dividends down the road. This is good government policy and good business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation met with members of Nelson Mandela's government of national unity elected in South Africa's first democratic elections in April 1994 and held working forums with members of five of the nine provincial parliaments.  In addition to meetings with leading public officials at the national, provincial and city levels, representing all the leading political parties, the delegation also had extensive discussions with representatives from important sectors of civil society, including the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), the Black business community, the South African Council of Churches and the Women's Development Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the their overall observations set out above, the delegation was impressed by the importance accorded at all levels to the government's Reconstruction and Development Program, which seeks to address the legacy of apartheid through long term comprehensive economic development. The delegation considered that this program provides important priority-setting capabilities. Housing construction and job creation are current key development areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The legislators we met all knew what their needs were. They all had goals.  Their difficulty lay in achieving those goals.&quot; -- Irma Hunter Brown. Many legislators expressed concern over proposals to cut U.S. assistance to Africa. There is near universal concern with the need to initiate economic growth and considerable enthusiasm for encouraging U.S. investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other concerns frequently raised were how to assure effective affirmative action in favor of the Black majority in all spheres of social, economic and political life, and how to ensure broad democratic participation in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Dumisani Kumalo reports, one of the current hotly debated issues in South Africa is how power will be shared between the central government and the provinces. Namibia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia, after five years of independence, has well defined democratic, national, regional and local government structures, and a feeling of great promise. But the delegation was also struck by extreme difficulties facing the major part of the population, living in considerable rural isolation in the north. The delegation also noted still visible scars of the recent war for liberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to meetings in the capital, Windhoek, the delegation traveled to the far north and the Atlantic coast to hold working forums with representatives from several of the most remote of Namibia's 13 elected regional councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major concerns included how, with very limited resources, to effectively direct government services towards those who need them the most. Local leaders described tensions with white tax payers who resent their tax money being spent on people in the Black townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nujoma summed up his country's priorities for the delegation. &quot;We get concerned when some people in the United States are calling for cutting aid to Africa. American aid is not just money to us. It is ammunition for the toughest fight we are involved in: the fight against poverty and ignorance... We must do something and we need the United States to continue to be on our side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe gained its independence in 1980 and has been grappling impressively with the problems of nation building, economic reconstruction and democratization for 15 years. Yet the delegation observed that this still seemed to be a society actively seeking to define and redefine the nature of its society and the structure of its institutions. As described by Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Mr. Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe &quot;began as a socialist government. But now we are changing towards a democratic, market oriented system....&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation met with the Speaker of Parliament, government ministers, Members of Parliament, regional and municipal elected officials. It traveled across the country, west of the capital, Harare, to Mashonaland West and the Victoria Falls. It participated in a legislative forum with the Chinhoyi Regional Council and also met with Zimbabwe's leading human rights organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean elected officials frequently raised questions relating to strengthening democratic procedures at local level. They were eager to increase active participation in the democratic process and were interested in suggestions as to how to improve communication with constituents and networking with counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were profoundly concerned that Zimbabwe should achieve a level of sustainable development sufficient to improve the lives of the people. They saw this as complicated by World Bank and International Monetary Fund polices that are compelling the government to redirect resources away from social services to encourage growth in sectors of the economy such as export industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main recommendations of the three delegation members, set out in their individual reports, reflect similar conclusions and can be summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. U.S. policy should be aimed at helping the governments and people of southern Africa preserve and extend their hard won democracy. Democracy in southern Africa is still fragile. The delegation recognizes that achieving the goals southern Africans desire, establishing a popular culture of peaceful, participatory democracy, with transparency of process and effective mechanisms for constructive criticism, will take time. Its achievement will have valuable consequences for both the U.S. and Africa, and deserves the fullest possible U.S. support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. U.S. policy makers should assist the countries of southern Africa address the basic needs of their citizens. This means supporting long term economic growth as well as social programs to heal the wounds of apartheid and colonial rule. The extreme disparity between the haves and have-nots threatens the progress of the new democracies. The delegation urges a long term U.S. commitment involving not only financial assistance but also talent and expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. U.S. aid to southern Africa should be increased, or at a minimum maintained at the present level. This is both in the U.S. national interest and in the interest of southern Africa. Aid must be given on the basis of the southern African agenda rather than one imposed from Washington. The aid program should support and sustain development strategies defined by the people of the region. The U.S. should ensure that its assistance policies are socially as well as economically responsible and target the poorest of the poor rather than those who are already advantaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The delegation urges evaluation and monitoring of the effectiveness of assistance programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The delegation strongly encourages U.S. legislators to work with the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and The Africa Fund, to swiftly expand legislative exchanges, build direct links and share experiences and expertise which can help enhance legislative capacity in southern Africa. Continuing ties between legislators in the U.S. and their counterparts in southern Africa will help U.S.  legislators effectively impact on national policy .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The delegation encourages increased trade and investment, which will be mutually beneficial to the U.S. and southern Africa. State legislators can help to identify products and resources within their own states that could be the basis for mutually beneficial trade. They should also encourage socially responsible investment by corporations from their home states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. should develop a special relationship with South Africa over the next decade, because a successful transition in South Africa will benefit the entire region. This relationship is rooted in ties that have been built over the last twenty years between the people of the United States and the people of South Africa. It would encompass expanded aid flows, closer political and social relations, and should include the early appointment of an African American Ambassador. A precedent for such a relationship can be found in the U.S. support for the countries that were parties to the Middle East peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this delegation was primarily concerned with meeting its counterparts at regional level, the great interest expressed by municipal leaders encourages the delegation to recommend that organizations such as the U.S. Conference of Mayors should undertake programs to strengthen municipal government, especially in South Africa where the first democratic municipal elections are scheduled for November 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Mozambique has privatized two of the country's three state-owned breweries, but the government will still hold 30 percent of the stock in the new holding company, news reports said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry, Trade and Tourism Minister Oldemiro Baloi announced the sell-off to Indol International, A Dutch subsidiary of South African Breweries (SAB)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indol will own 70 percent of the shares of the MacMahon brewery in Maputo, the capital, and the Beira brewery, in the northern port city. The two breweries now become a new company Cervejas de Mocambique sarl (Beers of Mozambique, ltd).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indol has promised to tranfer seven per cent of the stock to a local partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister assured brewery workers that &quot;privatisation is not an act of despair&quot;, but was necessary to ensure modernisation and increased production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indol has paid 14 million US dollars for its share of the breweries, and Indol general manager Andre Parker said the company was prepared to spend more to upgrade them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modernization is expected to cost 8.4 million dollars over the next three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The managing director of Cervejas de Mocambique, Craig McDougall, told the semiofficial Mozambique News Agency that none of the employees would lose jobs. But they would be retrained to handle new equipment and new work methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The breweries will continue to produce Mozambican brands, 2M and Manica, but they will also produce the South African brands Castle and Lion as well as such international labels as as Carling Black Llabel, Chandlers and St Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the largest investment so far by a South African company in the Mozambican privatisation programme, and the second largest investment in any former state-owned company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increased production from the breweries, and diversification of brands, should pull the rug from under the feet of smugglers who bring South African beer illegally into the country, the news agency sreported.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA)- Six weeks to the start of the 6th All Africa Games, the Zimbabwe government is being blamed for slowness in releasing funds to complete preparations for the events, slated for 13 to 23 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Games General Manager Macloud Chaora said in an interview Tuesday that only the quick disbursement of funds would facilitate the completion of final preparations for the successful hosting of the games. Already there was concern that delays in releasing funding to various government departments and parastatals involved in the games could cause national embarassment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is need for government to quickly disburse the funds which they have set aside for the games. Time is running out and provision of funds is late.  If the money is released now, something can be done to salvage the situation,&quot; said Chaora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Robert Mugabe's government announced in its budget last week that it had set aside the equivalent of six million US dollars for the Sports and Recreation Commission, the body responsible for organising the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chaora said the games were expected to bring together about 5 000 athletes from 42 countries which had so far confirmed their participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report prepared for government on the state of preparations regretted that while millions of dollars have been invested on new facilities and refurbishment of existing ones and yet inadequate funds were being made for the hosting of the event itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document was also critical about inadequate publicity due to lack of funds to carry out a major awarness campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the games needed to be appreciated as a national event which all citizens and institutions, the report said, the ordinary people think the games belong to the organising committee or just an opportunity for government related institutions to acquire what under normal circumstances they had not been able to obtain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the criticims, however, the 15 organising sub-committees for the games have made substantial progress towards the preparations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parirenyatwa in Hararehas been identified as the games hospital and an exclusive wing will be reserved for use during the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technical rules for all sports have been drawn and approved by the respective continental sports federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, six stamps have been issued by the posts and telecommunications corporation in commemoration of six disciplines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Burundi, Cape Verde, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea Liberia, Libya, Mauritania, Niger, Sierra Leone and Somalia have not yet confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi, Liberia and Somali are faced with civil war situations while Libya is suffering from the effects of a United States embargo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Trading On the stock market here opened on a bright note Monday with an increase in prices and the market's index despite a slowing down in volume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GSE all-share index rose by 1.92 points to close at 311.98 compared with Friday's close 310.06 points. &quot;Prices rode on the wave of impressive corporate performances with the Cedi gaining strenght against the dollar,&quot; said a dealer who was confident of an upward market trend during the week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the broader market, Standard Chartered Bank which climbed 100 cedis at 5,500 and Pioneer Tobacco Company (PTC) which rose four cedis at 130 were the market movers on a low volume of 33,430 shares. Friday's volume stood at 557,370 shares. &quot;There were, however, losses arising from a combination of market forces and price adjustment of certain shares&quot;, the dealer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those equities affected were Entreprise Insurance Company (EIC) which fell four cedis to 490 and UTC-estates which lost four cedis to close at 75 cedis.  The remaining equities maintained their price levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares offered which closed at 616,020 were, however, far more than those demanded by investors which ended at 262,810, leaving much on the books of brokers. The total market capitalization closed up at 2,326.30 billion cedis from the previous 2,324.47 billion cedis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following are the last prices of the listed equities: ABL, 275 Cedis, AGC, 25,200 Cedis, CFAO, 34 Cedis, EIC, 490 Cedis, FML, 217 Cedis, GGL, 210 Cedis, HFC, 118 Cedis, KBL, 622 Cedis, MGL, 130 Cedis, MLC, 55 Cedis, MOGL, 3,900 Cedis, PTC, 130 Cedis, PZ, 540 Cedis, SCB, 5500 Cedis, SPPC, 110 Cedis, UNIL, 841 Cedis AND UTC-E, 75 Cedis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, there seems to be a halt to the down trend of the Cedi against international currencies like the Dollar, Pound Sterling and the Deutsche Mark at both the official and parallel markets. The Central Bank's average interbank exchange Monday showed a stable Cedi against the three currencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, against the dollar, the Cedi closed 1,183.57 for buying and 1,202.14 for selling, while the Pound Sterling was bought for 1,886 and sold at 1,907.86. The Deutsche Mark ended at 840 for buying and 860.71, for selling the same as Friday's close.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The Zambian Kwacha seems to be stabilising after months of wholesale depreciation but currency watchers say they expect the local currency to slide further as shortage of hard currency persists. The kwacha exchanged in Lusaka Tuesday at the mean rate of 963 to one US dollar as against 962 to the greenback last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambian economy is mainly dependent on donor aid for foreign exchange.  This has been withheld pending a review of the country's Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), in September by officials of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IMF early this year suspended aid to Zambia saying government had breached some provisions of the SAP, which it adopted to spur national economic recovery programme. Lusaka still has to decide on the privatisation of its giant mining industry which the donors say should be put into private hands as soon as possible. The government also has yet to undertake a public service reform programme involving retrenchment of thousands of workers in a bid to trim expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donors said early this year that they were particularly unhappy about government decision to print money to bail out the privately-owned Meridien BIAO bank which has since been placed under receivership. Finance Minister Ronald Penza has said some 8.4 billion kwacha (about 8.4 million dollars) was pumped into the bank in a futile bid to bail it out its financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some independent sources said as much as 50 billion kwacha (about 50 million dollars) in public funds could have been advanced to the collapsed bank.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's commercial capital, Lagos with some six million people, has been hit by acute shortage of kerosine, a major household cooking fuel in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marketers interviewed by PANA Tuesday blamed the scarcity, which has jerked up the price of the commodity by more than 100 per cent, on inadequate supply.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many gas filling stations in Lagos say they had run out of stock, but illicit transaction is said to be booming. Industry sources also said the current scarcity might have been worsened by the recent closure for maintenance, of one of the country's four refineries in the mid-western town of Warri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A four-litre gallon of kerosine, which sold for 35 Naira a week ago, has shot up to 80 naira (about 1 USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with an estimated 90 million people, is an oil-producing country, but experiences sporadic fuel shortages blamed on distribution problems and smuggling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Rigobert Mukeni Lapess, PANA Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - The New Zaire appreciated by more than 40 per cent against the United States Dollar, exchanging in Kinshasa on Monday at the rate of 5,000 NZ to one dollar, from 7,200 NZ to the greenback two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spectacular rise of the NZ which had persistently declined since it was introduced in October 1993 followed a wide-ranging rescue campaign initiated by the government in collaboration with the bank of Zaire, which included mopping up excess local currency on the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of massive speculative sales of dollars by a Lebanese dealer as well as the arrest of senior officials at the New Bank of Kinshasa (NBK) accused of illegal transfer of 8 billion NZ from the Central Bank, also helped to shore up the local currency. In efforts to restore sanity to the country's finance sector, the Deputy Director of current accounts at the Bank of Zaire was arrested last week in Kinshasa for complicity in the illegal transfer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But finance analysts say the &quot;artificial&quot; rise of the NZ may not last for too long citing political issues such as the anticipated end of the transistion period on 9 July and a contributing factor. However, the depreciation of foreign currencies, considered as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in crisis ridden Zaire has caused panic among people, especially businessmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reaction to the depreciation of foreign currencies, some diamond dealers in Kinshasa were reported to be reluctant to sell their products for foreign currency. Some readily accepted the local currency while a few others preferred to wait until the situation became clearer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI,Kenya (PANA) - The Kenya shilling weakened further against the United States dollar and the British Pound Teusday, as analysts predicted a further depreciation of the local currency following the row between London and Nairobi that appeared to deepen uncertainity sorrounding the currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It lost SH 1.02 against the dollar and SH 1.46 cents against the pound sterling according to figures released by the Central Bank of Kenya (KCBK).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts said the currency was bracing for a stiffer show given the row between Kenya and Britain over a statement by British Minister for Overseas Development Lynda Chalker on future British assistance to Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The threat by government to reverse the reforms is most likely to drive the shilling's fall further by deepening the uncertainity and shattering investor confidence,&quot; an analyst who sought anonymity said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's population put at 88.5 million by a national census conducted in 1991, has now risen to 98 million, the National Population Commission (NPC) said here Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPC Chairman, Chris Ugokwe, who also heads the African Population Commission, told a press conference the figure represents a growth rate 2.83 per cent between 1991 and 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed a World Bank figure of 120 million as Nigeria's population.  &quot;the World Bank does not conduct census for any country...&quot; Ugokwe added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's constitutional conference, which ended in June had recommended that the 1991 figure be annulled because of objections raised in parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ugokwe said Tuesday that this was not peculiar to Nigeria. He cited instances in the United States, Britain and Germany where, he said, disputes over census figures had to be resolved at the supreme court. He said the NPC had received requests from a number of countries on the method it used for the 1991 census.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, preparations for Nigeria's next census in 2001 will commence next year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Police in the Zambian capital of Lusaka Tuesday blocked a planned demonstration march by university students protesting government's proposed change of name of their campus in honour of one of the country's deceased nationalist leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students who had gathered outside the campus awaiting police clearance to march to parliament were later told they could not be given a permit to stage the protest. They carried placards condemning the government which they accused of hypocrisy for wanting to use names of national heroes for political expediency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One placard read, &quot;UNZA (University of Zambia) to continue, Abash Nkumbula,&quot; in reference to late veteran nationalist Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula whose name the government has proposed to give to the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa announced this week that government would introduce a motion in parliament to rename the university, the Lusaka international airport and the Zambia Air Services Training Institute in memory of Nkumbula, Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe and Valentine Shula Musakanya, respectively, for their great contribution to the freedom struggle and development of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students, lecturers and researchers unions have opposed the move, saying the university had won so much international repute which they thought could be &quot;diluted&quot; by the sudden change of name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They and other critics have accused the ruling Movement of Multiparty Democracy (MMD) governement of President Frederick Chiluba of trying to use the names of the fallen national heroes for political gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkumbula, generally regarded as the founding father of Zambian nationalism had been leader of the African National Congress (ANC), fore-runner of the United National Independence Party (UNIP) which, under Kenneth Kaunda, won independence for Zambia. Kapwepwe once served as vice president to Kaunda and had been a fiery freedom fighter. Musakanya was Zambia's first junior minister incharge of technical education and had been instrumental in setting up the training school for Zambian pilots and other civil aviation personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has now been turned into a regional training centre for the 11-member Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-owned influential &quot;Times of Zambia&quot; Wednesday in an editorial also opposed the proposed renaming of the three institutions.  &quot;...with the kind of reaction that the suggested changes have met it is clear that there is a strong undercurrent of resistance. it would be wrong to assume that once the changes have been officially effected, resistance will fizzle out,&quot; it said. Zambian Police Stop Student Demonstration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkumbula hails from Zambia's southern region, recently ostracised by the main opposition,UNIP, by ditching its President Kebby Musokotwane, a southerner, in favour of former president Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts say Chiluba wants to use Nkumbula's name to woo southern support for his party and win further political sympathies among the politically militant northerners, the home base of both Kapwepwe and Musakanya. Zambia is scheduled to hold its second multiparty general elections in 1996, and Kaunda has said he will seek a re-match with Chiluba for the republican presidency. The first were in 1991 which brought Chiluba and his MMD to power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent NEW YORK, United States, (PANA) - Nigeria's Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, has called for dialogue between the United States and Nigeria as a way of easing the current tension between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time for dialogue and cooperation (between the countries),&quot; Ikimi said at several meetings Tuesday with members of editorial boards of major American newspapers and magazines based in New York. The minister said &quot;we have no interest in having confrontation with a country as powerful as the U.S.,&quot; adding: &quot;we have been long-time friends and trading partners and we wish to continue that way.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between the two countries have been strained largely by what Washington considers lack of progress in Nigeria's democratic process, especially since the last military regime of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida annulled the 12 June 1993 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States government has imposed limited sanctions on Nigeria because of the annulment and the return of military to Nigerian politics in November 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi said Nigeria's current head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, believed in dialogue and was interested in easing the tension between the two countries.  Stressing the need for Nigerian government officials to be able to meet with their U.S. counterparts, a situation which is not currently possible because visa restrictions, Ikimi said &quot;how can there be a meeting point without dialogue?&quot; He said &quot;if high-level Nigerian officials cannot come here, how can we discuss with the U.S.?,&quot; adding that his visit had been restricted to new York by the U.S. authorities. The minister, however said he had useful discussions with the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, George Moose, during the last OAU Summit in Addis Ababa, but could not follow up on that now &quot;because my visit here is restricted to the New York area&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials in Washington can't meet with me, which would have been good for the interest of both countries,&quot; he said, noting, however, that he had facilitated the visit to Nigeria of many U.S. officials and members of Congress in spite of the U.S. policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi met with editorial board members of the Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine and Amsterdam News, among others. He warned against the imposition of further sanctions on Nigeria, as currently being advocated by the lobby group Transafrica and some human rights organisations. According to him, sanctions would not hurt those in government alone but would affect the 100 million people of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sanctions will damage the potential of Nigeria to achieve its economic and political development,&quot; said Ikimi, who explained that he decided to meet with the American media to present the other side of issues to them as well as the American people who, he said, had been inundated with &quot;half truths and distortions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among issues that featured in Ikimi's meetings were the issue of clemency for those convicted of plotting to overthrow the military government, the annulled 1993 presidential elections and the political transition. They also discussed the fate of detained millionaire-politician, Moshood Abiola who claimed victory in the cancelled poll and Nigeria's battle against drug trafficking and corruption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Southern African Police Chiefs have formed a Sub-regional grouping to co-operate in combating crime among member countries of the the Southern African Development Community (SADC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grouping, named the Southern Africa Regional Police Chiefs Conference (SARPCCO), was formed at the end of the two-day police chiefs sub-regional conference here on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recommendations on how it should operate were presented for debate and possible adoption by the region's ministers in charge of law and order who had a one-day conference on Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chiefs, led by newly elected SARPCCO chairman, Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri of Zimbabwe, agreed that the decision-making and supervisory powers of SARPCCO be vested in the chiefs of Police Council.  They also agreed that a secretariat be established as the permanent administration and technical body through which SARPCCO would operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly created INTERPOL sub-regional bureau in Harare would be used for the purpose of setting up the SARPCCO secretariat. &quot;To ensure the effective functioning of SARPCCO and to avoid duplication of effort and waste of resources and finance, the activity of SARPCCO should be co-ordinated and carried out within the framework of the interpol sub-regional bureau,&quot; said a document prepared by the police chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same structures would also be used to prepare and co-ordinate a sub-regional police training strategy. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This strategy should take account of the possibilities which exist within the sub-region but also, where appropriate, those which can be made available through other international organisations and bilaterally by countries which can provide assistance,&quot; the chiefs recommended.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbwean president Robert Mugabe said on Wednesday he expects the Interpol sub-regional bureau to be opened in Harare to make a major contribution to regional security and effective crime prevention. Officially opening a conference of Southern African Law and Order ministers who are discussing the establishment of the Interpol office, Mugabe said although the region did not yet face crime problems as serious as those elsewhere, member countries should not be complacent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said using up-to-date crime tracing and communication facilities pledged to the harare bureau by interpol headquarters, regional police forces should develop human resources and structures which would enable them to effectively execute co-ordinated strategies for the management and monitoring of all forms of cross-border crime. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who believe that certain forms of criminal activity are here to stay must be made to swallow their words as the region develops its own capacity to respond to what appears to be an emerging pattern of organised crime,&quot; said Mugabe. Zimbabwe has allocated five million US dollars for the construction of the Interpol sub-regional bureau. Other countries would contribute administration funds and manpower for the bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Properly designed regional police training structures should enable our police forces not only to share perceptions, insights and ideas on topical policing issues, but also to develop research programmes that are appropriate to the policing needs and priorities of the region.&quot; Mugabe said he was concerned that specific strategies for crime combat in africa continued to be hampered by inadequate information and communication networks, lack of harmonisation of law and order legislation. Also of concern were the lack of appropriate regional crime prevention policies, capacity to carry out research that would make the region self-sufficient in matters relating to development of investigative techniques, drug detection and analysis and related skills, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The task before this conference is important from a political point of view. The world is currently focusing its attention on this region as we attempt to articulate appropriate mechanisms and strategies for the achievement of regional security and conflict resolution. &quot;There is need to place the crime combat agenda within the wider context of regional stability, peace and security because there can be no doubt at all that the prosperity of our region depends on them,&quot; he said. Mugabe said he was worried that although political stability was almost guaranteed in the region following the democratisation of South Africa and peace processes in Angola and Mozambique, there was still a problem of controlling firearms in private hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police within the region are expected to develop meaningful strategies to ensure that such firearms are not being turned on the peace-loving peoples of our region through illegal activities such as armed robbery, car-jackings and other terrorist attacks,&quot; he said. He supported Interpol's adoption of a resolution which recommended that its 176 member countries should trace all firearms from points of manufacture to purchasers as a way of monitoring arms use.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights body is expected to elect a new bureau capable of meeting the challenge of the disastrous situation of human rights in Africa. The Union held its constituent assembly here on 4 July 1992 in the presence of at least 30 non-governmental organisations and human rights groups. It has implanted itself in 37 African countries and brings together 35 NOGs and 14 human rights institutions. Since its inception, the unnion has strived to be present wherever there human rights are violated. It was particularly involved in the attempts to settle the crises in Rwanda and Burundi. It has also contributed to the settlement of the Tuareg issue in Mali and Niger.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It intervened in various African countries, especially in Senegal and Cote D'Ivoire, to call for the release of jailed opposition leaders.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - A Zambian official has attributed the outbreaks of epidemics like cholera, malaria and bilharzia in Southern Africa to the degradation of the environment in the region's countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, Juliana Chileshe, told a human rights and justice seminar here that these diseases can only be reverse through strategies at national levels to ensure sharing of tasks, information for development and co-ordination of efforts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chileshe said the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region lacked environmental education strategies and programmes to conduct the education in a comprehensive manner that reached all target groups. &quot;The degradation of the environment in the Southern African region has been marked by incidence of epidemics such as cholera, malaria and bilharzia,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A United Nations official has expressed concern at Zambia's high infant mortality rate of 112 children per 1000 per year before the age of five because mothers ignore the importance exclusive breastfeeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Stirling, Zambia's Representative of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said this Tuesday in Lusaka during the launch of activities marking the 1 to 7 August World Breastfeeding week. He said due to lack of breastfeeding, roughly one in every 10 live births in the country die before their first birthday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, he predicted, about 35,000 Zambian infants will die, most of them within the first few months of their life, of preventable illnesses like diarrhoea, respiratory infections, fevers and malnutrition. Stirling said that while these figures are alarming, they could be changed if mothers fed their children with breast milk for at least six months. He urged feeding mothers to understand the purpose of breast feeding.He called on the families and employers with breastfeeding mothers to give them support and encouragement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN official said the government and UNICEF were working out plans to make at least 40 maternity facilities 'Baby Friendly&quot; by the end of the year.These hospitals will be given the means to encourage exclusive breastfeeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking earlier, the Chairperson of the Breastfeed Association of Zambia, Rose Namambo said the mothers' lactating period should be increased from the current three months to at least two years. She also called on employers to provide opportunities at work places that would enable mothers continue breastfeeding their children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last consignment of buses ordered (72, from India, paid for by a five million dollar grant from Japan) were given to the three main cities of Maputo, Beira and Nampula.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this will not necessarily mean an increase in the number of buses in the capital because, as the old buses are reconditioned, the new ones currently operating in Maputo will be redistributed elsewhere in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference launching the Community Assistance Week of the forces, Mahachi said the downsizing exercise was on course, with the army retiring or retrenching some soldiers every month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eighty percent of our budget is spent on wages and salaries, we need to reduce that,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Launching the week, which is a prelude to activities to celebrate defence forces day on August 12, Mahachi said defence forces would be deployed to children's homes and disadvantaged rural communities to carry out wide ranging activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defence forces' involvement in various local community projects demonstrates the close link and association between our defence forces and the local communities in which they are based. &quot;It also helps improve their public relations with the people in these various locations,&quot; said Mahachi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forces will repaint schools, construct classrooms and toilets, carry out cleaning exercises and render free health services at some hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During this year's community assistance week, a combined United States and Zimbabwe defence forces team will render comprehensive health services to people around selected centres in the country,&quot; said Mahachi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Peter Masebu, PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Circumcised males face fewer risks of HIV infection than those who are not, according to a leading Senegalese Virologist, Prof.  Souleymane Mboup of Cheikh Anta Diop's Faculty of Medicine in Dakar. The doctor is currently researching the possibility that the resistance a group of HIV Type 2 infected Dakar-based prostitutes have shown towards HIV Type 1 infection for a decade could provide a clue for an AIDS vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a wide-ranging interview here, however, the military doctor, internationally recognised for his discovery of the less virulent Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Type 2 (HIV 2), said he lacked data on whether female circumcision provided the same protection. He was asked to comment on findings from a 1993 research, conducted on 837 married men in Kigali, Rwanda, which established that 29 per cent of the uncircumcised were seropositive compared with 21 per cent of those who were.The results were published in January by the Journal of AIDS. &quot;These results confirm what we have been saying all along, that circumcision reduced not only HIV infection but also the risk of other sexually transmitted diseases, hence the low infection rate in countries like Senegal where the majority of the population are Moslems,&quot; Mboup told PANA. His argument seems to be strong, according to African country by country HIV infection rates published in a book by the Dakar-based non-governmental organisation, Enda-Tiers Monde, in 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 274-page book &quot;SIDA en Afrique. Bilan d'une Decenie&quot; (Aids in Africa.  The Results of a Decade) shows that the mainly Christian eastern and southern African countries as leading in terms of HIV infection. The book placed Malawi on top with 13 per cent, followed by Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe (10 per cent each), 9 per cent for Kenya and 7 per cent for Burundi while Rwanda recorded 4 per cent. Cote d'Ivoire led the pack in West Africa with 8.5 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Low HIV infection rates were recorded in countries with predominantly Moslem populations: Chad (1 per cent), Libya (0.02), Mauritania (0.25), Mali (1.4) Morocco (0), Niger (0.7), Senegal (1) Somalia (0.5) and Sudan (0.2 per cent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But according to Mboup, Africa and the rest of the Third World are now faced with a catastrophic AIDS situation because those who were infected ten years ago have graduated from the infection into the disease phase, &quot;while continuing to infect others as well.&quot; &quot;This is mainly because in the initial stage people ignored to take care of infected persons thinking this was not a priority. But now we shall witness a lot of deaths and very many sick people,&quot; he added. The major problem, Mboup said, is the unaffordability of drugs like AZT which prolongs the life of those infected and can block the transmission of HIV from a mother to her unborn infant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We lack the means to buy these drugs. In Senegal, treatment with AZT costs 150,000 F CFA (1 $= 480 F CFA) per month. Very few can afford and the drug does not prevent death forever,&quot; he told this correspondent. According to the virologist, bactrim is the only affordable anti-biotic which delays the disastrous effects of &quot;opportunistic diseases like pulmonary infections and diarrhoea&quot; and improves the health status of sufferers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof. Mboup, who is a member of a World Health Organisation (WHO) select committee on AIDS vaccines, said none of the 12 that were being tried had yielded the required results before going into Phase III, on humans. &quot;The scientific community is currently very divided on this issue with certain countries and organisations saying Phase III trials should go ahead even before conclusive results are obtained in Phase I and II, as was with the case with other vaccines. Others are saying that, for safety reasons, the trials should only start after the first two phases have given assurances,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to what was the African position in that controversial issue, Mboup said: &quot;I think we African scientists need to hold serious consultations before entering the final phase. We need to talk the same language to secure the health of our populations.&quot; According to him, the forthcoming International African Conference on Aids and Sexually Transmitted Diseases, slated for Kampala, Uganda, in December 1995, will be a good opportunity for Africans to come up with a concise stand on the issue of vaccines.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwean Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy is unhappy with this year's inadequate allocation to hospitals owned by local authorities, missionaries and voluntary organisations, saying this will negatively impact on the country's health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1995/96 budget announced by Finance Minister Ariston Chambati on 27 July, local authorities, missions and voluntary organisations were allocated the equivalent of 27.1 million US dollars compared with 22 million US dollars last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview Wednesday, Stamps said while there were nominal increases in the budget, in real terms the budget was less than last year. The local authorities, missions and voluntary organisations have been lobbying for an increase in government funding to ensure health services do not deteriorate.  Stamps said local authorities might be forced to hike hospital and clinic fees during this financial year to meet some of their escalating costs. He said the local authorities, mission hospitals and voluntary organisations, such as St Giles, should have been allocated at least 35.3 million US dollars to operate effectively and efficiently.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The allocation to my ministry was not an increase but was, in real terms,( 11.8 million US dollars) less than that of the 1994/95 fiscal year. This means that we will have to cut back in some areas. &quot;The most affected are the missions, local authorities and voluntary organisations. &quot;They need in excess of zd 300 million, not the zd 230 million grant given. I do no want the ministry of finance to get me wrong - I appreciate that there is no money but it is just that the funds would affect health services in the country,&quot; Stamps said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the inadequate funding would not affect salaries and wages but would have adverse effects on material things, like drugs and equipment.  mission hospitals are already facing a serious shortage of drugs and insufficient equipment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - A Polish-built cargo ship bought by the Ethiopian Shipping Lines at a cost of 7.375 million dollars has become operational. The ship bought from a German company and named 'Admas' will replace the ageing 'Nigiste Saba', which has served for many years, Officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admas has 9,630 horse power and a capacity to carry 11,573 tonnes of cargo.  Transport and Communications Vice-Minister, Ayenew Bitewilign said at the inaugural ceremony held at Assab Port on Monday that marine transport would help promote the country's foreign trade. Ayenew said Admas would increase the shipping capacity of the national carrier from 81,400 tonnes to 93,000 tonnes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ship, along the company's 30 years experience and its trained manpower would help strengthen not only Ethiopia's but also Africa's marine transportation, he said. The General Manager of the Shipping line, Ambachew Abraha, said 13 boats including the new one would be deployed to north-western Europe, the mediterranian, and countries in Middle and Far-east. He said the ships had been transporting refined petroleum and goods in border areas, adding that 80 per cent of the crew members and all office workers of the enterprise are Ethiopians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admas, whose carrying capacity exeeds that of Nigiste Saba by half, has a multi-dimentional service in transporting not only freight goods but also containers and others. Addisu Demissie, manager of the market survey and promotion service of the company, said on the occasion that the enterprise plans to buy better ships to replace old ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the tranports minister, Admas was visited Monday by Gebretsadkan Gebretensay, Chief of Defence Staff and Board Chairman of the Ethiopian Shipping Lines as as well as officials of the Eriterian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company reportedly makes a turn-over of some 300 million birr (about 54 million dollars) every year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Companies listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange are unlikely to float rights issues for the rest of this year as market sentiment remains depressed by a combination of drought and high inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stockbrokers said Tuesday said any rights issue would not receive enough support as investors currently preferred the lucrative short-term money market where returns where returns are as high as 27 percent for 90-day paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market is currently weak for a rights issue,&quot; Arthur Mavima of Dataworld Ltd said. He said the market has this year seen only two private placings by TSL and FSI.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, like gold producer Cluff Resources Zimbabwe Ltd, have said they will only float a rights issue when the market recovers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, analysts say prospects for meaningful recovery this year are bleak given that inflation is expected to rise to about 25 percent by the end of the year from the current 19.9 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higher inflation will mean interest rates are unlikely to come down in the near future resulting in a further flight of funds from the bourse to the attractive money market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quincor stockbrokers say it is only foreign investors who are currently a bit active in the market. These are however supporting only highly capitalised securities like Delta. Other counters enjoying investment from foreigners include Bindura and Zimsun.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(PANA) -- Zambia is now experiencing high inflation and interest rates because commercial banks in the country cheated the central bank over their statutory reserve requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of the newly created financial markets department of the Bank of Zambia (BOZ), Situmbeko Musokotwane was reported Tuesday in the local press saying that the commercial banks avoided the the statutory reserve ratio and cheated by disguising their true deposit liquidity positions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ratio is used to compell banks to lock away 29 percent of their liquid assets in the central bank to infleunce liquidity and achieve macro-economic targets such as reduced inflation. The banks also cheated through the use of subsidiary leasing companies which were conveniently used to shift bank deposits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOZ is no longer using the statutory reserve ratio because it was &quot;increasingly getting to be an ineffective instrument of monetary policy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Situmboko said because of these shortcomings, the BOZ was now using daily open market operations to provide a more flexible instrument for monetary operations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trading was quiet as investors seen to be waiting for fresh market movingg news and probably the close of the social security bank's public offer floatation&quot;, said a market player.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Yahya El Hassan, PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - The government of Sudan has exempted wheat imports from all taxes, a move considered necessary to make up for a short fall in local production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of Industry, Badr Eddin Suleiman, told the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) the measures also include the liberalisation of wheat distribution and the exemption of local flour mills from all forms of taxes.  The move is expected to end the rationing of bread which will henceforth be available at a price determined by the forces of supply and demand, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suleiman said the new policy is meant to redress the gap in wheat supply caused by fluctuating local production. He put the country's current wheat consumption at 600,000 tonnes per annum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortages of wheat have have nearly doubled the domestic price of the product since April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the Minister of Agriculture, Ahmed Ali Geneif, said wheat producers will be paid the equivalent of USD 254 per tonne in addition to 25 percent subsidy on production cost as an incentive. Meanwhile, the official 'El Sudan El Hadeith Newpaper has said some 200,000 tonnes of wheat were imported into the country last year to meet local shortages. Sudan produced 300,000 tonnes of wheat last year. Figures for this year are not available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government in 1991 vowed to produce one million tonnes of wheat on the irrigated farms in central and northern parts of the country. But Farmers were only able to produce 800,000 tonnes of the crop in 1992. Since then production has contined to fall largely due to rising costs and relatively warm weather in wheat growing areas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria plans to construct an underground rail transport network or Metroline for its inland capital, Abuja, in what is being seen as a precautionary measure against the transport chaos in the nation's former capital, Lagos. Abuja formally replaced Lagos in December 1991 as Nigeria's seat of government, but the port city remains the country's economic hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian minister of state for the Federal Capital Territory, Mariam Ikejiani-Clark said at a forum organised by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday the Abuja metroline is proposed for the 1996-1998 National Rolling Plan. She did not elaborate on the cost, but said the decision to commence the construction of the line was to ease transport problems faced by commuters in the territory. Unlike Lagos, harbouring some six million people, Abuja has less than one million inhabitants, mainly civil servants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But problems of public transportation are gradually creeping into the city conceived in 1976 to ease the congestion in Lagos. A proposal by the previous civilian government to construct a metroline in lagos in 1982 at an estimated cost of 700 million U.S. dollars was cancelled by a subsequent military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cancellation cost the state government more than 30 million dollars in default payment to the consortium of french companies, which took the state government to court. Experts consider a metroline project as one of the solutions to the perennial traffic congestion in Lagos, but government officials say the cost has become unaffordable. Abuja's transport problem is compounded by inadequate accommodation, with many of the inhabitants now resident in satellite towns. Ikejiani-Clark said buses previously run by the Abuja urban mass transport company had been grounded by lack of spare parts.  Most foreign missions, currently operating from Lagos have been given until the end of 1997 to move to Abuja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the problem of accommodation, the minister said some 25,500 plots had been allocated to Nigerians since the creation of the capital territory. But according to the minister, government revoked some of the allocations because of the inability of the allotees to develop them after the statutory period of six years expired. She said she had reorganised the land department of the ministry to stem corruption, adding: &quot;Abuja is the federal capital, so, every Nigerian desirous of land should be able to get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission was set up earlier this year to investigate human rights violations during the Apartheid era in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The generals said they would co-operate to ensure that the truth and reconciliation commission was successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they also expressed reservations about who should be responsible for human rights violations of the past, saying the investigation could turn into a witch-hunt against individuals who merely followed orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Minister Dullah Omar said at a media briefing follwong a meeting between the generals and President Nelson Mandela that the generals had accepted that there had been violations of human rights in the past which needed to be dealt with by the commission.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUANDA, Angola (PANA) - the United Nations chief military observer to Angola, Major General Chris Garuba on Thursday expressed confidence in the Angolan peace process despite repeated violation of the cease-fire by both sides and a &quot;food aid&quot; war being waged by the rebel Unita movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garuba told Zimbabwean journalists that cease-fire violations were down to 90 incidents last month compared to 137 a month in the previous two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can see there is some progress and if the trend continues we are headed for a happy and successful peace process,&quot; he said. About 45 percent of the cease-fire violations were attacks on civilian targets designed to either control the movement of food aid in contested areas or to stop people from moving into areas controlled by the other side. Garuba named Jonas Savimbi's Unita forces as being responsible for attacks on civilian targets as they try to control the movement of food aid to famine-stricken areas in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a new tactic and we have put it to unita that they should desist from this kind of unfortunate action,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, Major General Garuba said, roads cleared of mines had mines laid again overnight thereby delaying the deployment of un peace-keepers in those areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, only 15 percent of the incidents were military manouvres to reinforce troops or gain territory while the rest were what Garuba said were &quot;very minor incidents that would not derail the peace process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 3 664 troops from India, Uruguay and Zimbabwe are already in Angola to oversee the implementation of the peace accord between the MPLA government and Unita to end nearly two decades of civil war.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian police are keeping a vigilant eye to avert possible political violence during the ongoing by-election campaigns in the Eastern Luangwa parliamentary constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This past weekend, Police Inspector-General Francis Ndholvu sent re-inforcements to prevent possible clashes between supporters of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) and the main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what is expected to be a major test of popularity, the two parties are fighting tooth and nail to snatch the Luangwa parliamentary seat during the by-election, scheduled for 25 August.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndhlovu confirmed in Lusaka Sunday that a contingent of police officers had been sent to the area following reports of near confrontation between rival party supporters over rooms at the only rest-house in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP President Kenneth Kaunda was Saturday in Luangwa to spearhead his party's campaign for the parliamentary seat which fell vacant early this year after the death of the party's member of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MMD supporters reportedly attempted to deny the UNIP entourage accommodation at the local rest house which is owned by a local prominent member of President Frederick Chiluba's party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Luangwa by-election is among eight others to be held 25 august in various parts of the country following either the resignation, death or expulsion of incumbents. They include the Mpulungu and Mbala parliamentary seats formerly held by former MMD junior ministers, Derrick Chitala and Dean Mung'omba who were recently expelled from the ruling party. Both Chitala and Mung'omba have declined to recontest the seats saying they still needed to consolidate their newly formed party, the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were kicked out of Chiluba's MMD because they openly criticised his management of public affairs. The MMD and UNIP have fielded candidates for all the constituencies. The by-elections are expected to provide an insight into Kaunda's current public rating since his re-election as UNIP President, replacing his former Prime Minister Kebby Musokotwane. Political analysts here say Kaunda is likely to &quot;leave no stone unturned&quot; in his campaigns for the by-elections and is expected to use the results to gauge his party's chances to regain power in the scheduled 1996 general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His party suffered a blow last week when a veteran member and leader of the minority bench in parliament, Dingiswayo Banda, defected to the ruling party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa intends to honour an agreement to store 15-million barrels of Iranian oil, despite American efforts to win allies in an embargo against the Gulf state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The General Manager of South Africa's state-owned Strategic Fuel Fund, Mr.  Kobus Van Zyl, says Pretoria may even try to increase the quantity or Iranian crude it is to store.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the apartheid era, the strategic Fuel Fund was instrumental in ensuring that South Africa obtained and stocked enough oil, in spite of an international oil embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But recently,the Fund's agreement with the National Iranian Oil Company is believed to have sparked friction with the United States, which imposed a trade and commerce ban on Iran on 6 June this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ban has found little international support as countries like Russia and Japan have resisted Washington's attempts to trade with Teheran because of its alleged support for terrorism. Van Zyl confirmed that South Africa and Iran will market the oil jointly, although the bulk of the trading activity is likely to be organised by South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran supplies 60 to 70 per cent of South Africa's oil needs of some 420 000 barrels a day. Choosing South Africa as a storage site, said Van Zyl, would assure its market here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Mozambican Finance and Planning Minister Tomas Salomao has announced simplifications in the procedures for documentation of potential investors in the country. Speaking at a press conference in Maputo, Salomao said there would now be a genuinely &quot;one stop&quot; investment procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of the existing heavy bureaucratic system, investors will now merely have to submit their requests to just one institution, the Investment Promotion Centre (CPI), which would then undertake all the necessary coordination with other state bodies. He said strict time limits were to be stipulated, adding that the finance ministry or provincial governments must give replies to investment requests within 10 working days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa's economic prospects are brightening, according to latest indications from the country's banking sector. In releasing its third-quarter economic outlook, the prestigious Standard Bank expressed the opinion that South African economic growth is set to resume in the second half of this year. This followed a slowdown in the first six months of the year mainly because of the extraordinary pace of expansion after the April 1994 all-race elections which brought democratic governance to the country after centuries of apartheid rule. The bank stated that it expected an increase of three per cent in South African Gross Domestic Product this year, and predicted that GDP for 1996 was likely to rise by four per cent. Like all of southern Africa, said the bank, the South African economy would not escape the effects of drought.  Fortunately South Africa has suffered far less than its southern African counterparts, and the drought had been fairly mild. Nevertheless, lower agricultural output as a result of the drought would probably drop economic growth by 0.5 per cent. Accordingly, to Standard Bank, another 0,5 per cent would probably be cut from South Africa's economic growth this year because of a reduction in gold production. Next year, however, as much as 0.7 per cent could be added to South Africa's GDP if the gold mining industry could halt the decline in its productivity and climb back to last year's output levels. Even more optimistically, a return to 1993 gold output levels could add close to one per cent to the GDP. A major factor which led the mining industry to have a negative effect on South African economic growth this year was labour problems. The resultant loss in production had a drastic downward effect on foreign currency earnings. If production levels continued to decline, the bank added, gold mining could become a significant restriction on future economic growth in South Africa. The governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Chris Stals, has warned that the South African government must scale down its budget deficit more rapidly if the economy is to exceed the three per cent economic growth level. &quot;The government needs to do more in terms of rapid restructuring &quot;South Africa's Reconstruction and Development Programme can make a valuable contribution to restructuring by improving educational facilities and standards, and by raising productivity&quot;, Stals said but added, &quot;but the benefits take time to filter through&quot;. The country's high fiscal deficit, which continues to swallow domestic savings, imposes structural limitations on the ability of the economy to grow without access to foreign capital -- particularly long-term capital. Meanwhile a senior delegation from the International Monetary Fund visited South Africa earlier this month, fuelling speculation that the government is preparing an application for an IMF stand-by facility, in view of the deterioration in the current account of the balance of payments. Economists here say that the balance of payments could end the year with a deficit of about three billion dollars. Stals insists, however, that no such application for a standby facility is being made. There is no need for such action, he says, as capital inflows are more than sufficient to cover the current account deficit. Either way, while predictions of a resumption in economic growth are encouraging, many economists and businessmen are convinced that South Africa faces a prolonged struggle to develop and maintain a satisfactory economic revival.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of more complex requests, which have to be brought before the full cabinet, the time limit will be 20 working days, the minister said. He added that if no reply was received within the time limit, it would be presumed that the request had been a approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, minimum values for direct investment have been cut from 15,000 to 5,0o0 dollars (or the equivalent in local currency) for Mozambican investors. The minimum for a direct foreign investment was set at 50,000 dollars. The need for a deposit has been eliminated. In addition, he said, investors will begin to enjoy tax benefits as soon as they present a declaration that they have begun operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Director of Taxes, Aboobacar Changa, told reporters that, for their first cycle of production, investors will be exempt from import duties, sales and circulation taxes on all raw materials used, including packaging.  To obtain these benefits, it will only be necessary to present the customs office with a list of goods to be imported approved by the finance ministry.  The exceptional tax breaks granted to &quot;industrial free zones&quot; will now be extended to any company that exports at least 85 per cent of its production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salomao said the Mozambican bureaucratic system could not be changed overnight, adding that the government wanted to reach a stage where any investor &quot;just needs to have resources, to be registered, to have a tax number and can then get on with his activity&quot;. Businessmen have complained repeatedly over the clumsy, parasitic bureaucracy which Mozambique inherited from Portuguese colonial rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measures are a first step to create a &quot;business-friendly&quot; climate in Mozambique after years of control under a marxist system which was replaced by a democratic government following elections held last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a seminar on agricultural liberalisation held at Egerton University near Nakuru town, 157 kilometres from Nairobi, at the week-end, the farmers estimated that coffee production would rise to around 85,000 tonnes in 1995 from 81,000 tonnes in 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tea also saw improved production from the 209,000 tonnes produced in 1994, the farmers noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But organisations involved in the production of sugar, maize and cotton say they have hardly benefitted from the reform-inspired Agricultural boom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At best, their activities are barely trying to recover from poor farm policies and excessive imports which haved been their undoing since 1993. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declining crop husbandry, poor weeding and fertiliser application, and poor cor-dination between agriculture and processing departments at some of the factories has meant that harvested crops can be of less than optimal quality&quot;, the said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government policy paper said transparency in parastatal reform and privatisation was elusive and reforms requiring the sale of factories to private investors raised political and equity problems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - More than 117 million kg of flue-cured tobacco worth over zimdollars 2 billion (USD 235 million) have been sold at the tobacco auction floors since sales opened in April, the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZTA Public Relations Director, Lal Burton-Taylor, said prices, which collapsed in 1993 under the weight of a poor quality crop and over-supply on world markets, had firmed, particularly during the past few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, a kilogramme of the crop went for zd 20 (USD 2.40/kg) on Monday this week, one of the highest ever paid. Burton-Taylor said by the end of the auction season in less than eights week's time, farmers would have sold an estimated 190 million kg worth more than ZD 3 billion (USD 353 million).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With processing and packaging costs added, the value of the crop to the country would be much more, she said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have sold in excess of 117 million kg so far which means we are about two-thirds down the line. We are expecting to sell 190 million kg and at current prices, this could realise more than ZD 3 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton-Taylor said farmers had already started preparing for the new season, and indications were that a crop in excess of 210 million kg would be produced in 1995/96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZTA, buoyed by rising demand for high-quality flue-cured tobacco on world markets, this year recommended an annual increase in production of 10 percent over the next few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton-Taylor said the ZTA was expecting a normal season for tobacco growers provided rains fell during the crucial month of november.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will only be in trouble if it does not rain in November,&quot; she said.  Burton-Taylor also said tobacco farmers had managed to secure cheap off-shore finance from local banks to finance production this season, which, according to estimates made early this year, required ZD 3 billion (USD 353 million).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago, this visit by fund managers with up to 40 billion dollars to spend would have been impossible. The Nigerian military government had then reverted to regulating the economy after eight years of Structural Adjustment during which deregulation was the order of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 1995 budget changed this. Government came out with measures to place the country back on the path of guided deregulation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

These are the Exchange Control Act of 1962 and the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree of 1989. The former limited the free movement of foreign currency in the country while the latter restricted foreign ownership of some business concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their place, government last month signed two new statutes into law : the Nigerian Investment Promotion Decree and the Foreign Currency and Capital Investment Monitoring Decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Finance Minister Anthony Ani, the first law is meant to guarantee foreign investment against nationalisation or expropriation by government and allow foreigners to buy shares in any Nigerian company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, it will now be possible to transfer unconditionally abroad through authorised banks, funds, dividends, net profits, debt repayments and remittances of proceeds from sale or liquidation of an enterprise or any interest attributed to investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the second law which formalises the Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market, anyone transacting business in the foreign exchange market shall not be required to disclose the source of the hard currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It appears that foreign investors would soon be able to invest in the Nigerian Economy which was closed before,&quot; said John Taylor of the UK-based Morgan Grenfell, one of the fund managers who visited the country in June before the new laws came into force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts agree that Nigeria is at last serious about attracting foreign investment. For its part, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) is bracing up for an upsurge in activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new law has opened the door for foreign stockbrokers to become trading members of the exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, shares of Nigerian companies can now be traded simultaneously on other exchanges with which the nse collabotates. Foreigners can now buy shares in Nigerian companies too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">f its recent performance is anything to go by, the the NSE is a safe place to invest. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a subsidiary of the World Bank, considers it as one of the promising emerging markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1993 and last year, the NSE all-share index went up from 1543.8 to 2205, representing a 42.8 per cent rise in local currency terms. In the second quarter of 1994, it gained 6.5 per cent in dollar terms. The mood of the key officals of the exchange is upbeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are to go by the results being declared by quoted companies, we are likely to see a continuous growth in both the local index and the IFC index,&quot; Pascal Dozie, president of the NSE told PANA. However, one worry of foreign portfolio investors, is the volume of the market. With a market capitalisation of about 1.5 billion dollars, for example, the fund managers who visited in June with an aggregate of 40 billion dollars to spend say what they may be able to invest in the market might be too small to impress their own investors initially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they were quick to point out that they could invest adequately when the government decides to embark on another round of privatisation exercises.  Huge state-owned utilities like the telecommunication and electricity companies are among those being eyed by investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other problems that foreiners may encounter include the lack of efficient infrastructure. Public utilities such as telephone, electricity and the postal services are very unreliable, inhibiting smooth capital market operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exchange too has its own peculiar problems. &quot;Settlement and custodian problems continue to bog trading transactions. The operations are still manually done,&quot; says the IFC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trading is via the call-over system whereby the brokers shout their bids and offers across the table in the trading ring while an official of the exchange oversees the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, efforts have been intensified to eliminate the delays caused by the manual operation. A central securities clearing house is to be established before the end of the year, officials say. The NSE has acquired for the clearing system the Canadian Alberta Stock Exchange Software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the new system, the average time needed for clearing should drop to seven days,&quot; says IFC experts who recommended the system. While these developments are unfolding, the regulatory authorities are on the alert to ensure that the capital market continues to remain quite healthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has warned that deregulation does not mean lack of regulation, stressing that it would continue to perform its duties with the interest of the investors in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEC's Chief Executive, George Akamiokhor, intends to impress on the government the need to further remove the remaining obstacles facing foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tax regime still needs to be reviewed downwards. In Nigeria, capital gains tax is 20 per cent, corporate income tax is 35 per cent and witholding tax is 10 per cent. Lowering these taxes, will help&quot;, says Akamiokhor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Tanzania has renewed efforts to get neighbouring Uganda to pay off a long outstanding debt -- for getting rid of dictator Idi Amin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzanian troops, at the request of opposition Ugandan leaders in exile, invaded landlocked Uganda in 1979 and hounded Amin into exile.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He remains in Saudi Arabia to this day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan state minister for defence Amama Mbabazi confirmed the debt Tuesday when he appeared before the ruling National Resistance Council (NRC) Committee on Legal and Security Affairs to present his ministry's policy statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not disclose the amount but unconfirmed reports put the figure at 100 million US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1979 Tanzania committed thousands of troops and large arms towards the overthrow of the Idi Amin dictatorsip. After Amin was removed from power, Tanzanian forces remained in the country for two years to help set up the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said the debt was negotiated between the Milton Obote government, which succeeded Amin, and Tanzania. &quot;We have to pay these debts inspite of our feelings about them,&quot; Mbabazi said. Amin's decade-long reign was one of the bloodiest in recent African history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former army sergeant ordered the murders and torture of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans. Many more were detained or driven out of the country.  Amin himself personally killed some opponents, and ate their flesh.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Paul Ejime PANA Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Liberian warlords gathered in the Nigerian capital of Abuja today for a fresh round of talks aimed at ending the six-year civil conflict in their country, Africa's oldest republic. There was little room for optimism, based on past records. There have been some 50 similar conferences in the past, and a dozen peace pacts have been torn up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war started in December 1989 as a rebellion by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) against President Samuel Doe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting has killed more than 150,000 people and made refugees of about half of the 2.5 million population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), of which Liberia is a member, has been striving to silence the guns and several warring factions there. Ecowas also has several thousand peacekeeping troops in the territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest mini-summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is being held against the background of a United Nations threat to pull out its own observers FROM Liberia by September 15 if &quot;there is no concrete progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To demonstrate its seriousness, the UN last week withdrew 17 of its remaining 70 peacekeepers from Liberia. There were some 350 UN observers in Liberia by 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several unheeded warnings to the warring factions, the West African community has had to scale down its force to about 8,000-men from around 15,000 troops in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ecowas current chairman President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana is also on record as having warned for the upteenth time that the force could be pulled out for good, unless the warring factions showed serious commitment to peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many had thought that with the murder in September 1990 of Doe, considered the major obstacle then, the Liberian crisis was half solved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, hostilities among the protagonists have continued giving rise to a multiplicity of factions from three in 1992 to around eight presently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least five of the factions are already in Abuja for the Ecowas summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include Charles Taylor, who arrived in Abuja Monday, leading a 40-man delegation, Gen. Ezekiah Bowen of the Armed Forces of Liberia, Francois Massaquoi of the Lofa Defence Force and Roosevelt Johnson, head of another faction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamba Tailor, 90, a representative of Liberia's traditional rulers, and Monrovia politician Oscar Quiah are also attending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virtually alienated from the peace process since 1992 when he arrived as an exile in Nigeria is Prince Yormie Johnson, Charles Taylor's rival, whose forces were captured and tortured Doe to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson feels strongly about his &quot;marginalisation,&quot; and says Liberia would know no peace until he was taken aboard the peace-chasing wagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, a five-man Ghanaian delegation led by the country's deputy foreign minister, Mohamed Ibn Chambas, has arrived in Abuja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Zimbabwean President Rev. Canaan Banana, a representative of the Organisation of African Unity committee on Liberia, and UN Envoy, Anthony Nyakyi, were also being expected in Abuja Wednesday for the August 20-21 summit. --</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe is to hold its presidential elections during the first quarter of 1996, it was officially announced in Harare Thursday. The Secretary for Legal Affairs of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union -Patriotic Front (ZANU PF), Eddison Zvobgo, told a news conference here that &quot;obviously the election must be held in the first quarter of next year. The date will be fixed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential polls will be held a year after parliamentary elections because the head of state's term of office is six years while that of legislators is five years, following amendments made to the constitution prior to the 1990 General Elections. Zvobgo re-affirmed the hostility of President Robert Mugabe's government towards the idea of holding an all party constitutional conference, as suggested by several opposition parties. He termed these calls as &quot;foolish requests&quot; from what he called &quot;stupid parties&quot; who were trying to use such a conference lick their wounds after their election defeat. Mugabe's ZANU PF party won 118 of the 120 contested seats in the April parliamentary elections, with two seats going to Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole's ZANU (NDONGA). At least eight opposition parties boycotted the parliamentary elections on claims that the electoral law favoured the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zvobgo said none of the parties had brought any of their concerns about the constitution or electoral act to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition parties, he said, only surfaced towards elections.&quot;These parties have vanished. You will see them in the year 2,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Recent student protests and a walk-out by opposition parliamentarians last Friday, seem to have convinced the Zambian government not to push ahead with the controversial bills to re-name the University of Zambia and the Lusaka International Airport. Without saying the idea is buried, Education Minister Alfeyo Hambayi told parliament here Wednesday that the bill that could have facilitated the change of name of the academic institution to 'Harry Mwaanga Nkubula University&quot; in honour of a veteran politican, has been deferred for consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His collegue, Communications and Transport Minister Dawson Lupunga also postponed the aviation bill which was to allow the re-naming of the Lusaka International Airport to Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe, another deceased nationalist politician.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday, opposition members of parliament walked out of the House in protest against the two bills when they were presented. They claimed the bills were proposed in bad faith and that no consultations had been made on the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, students at the University of Zambia rioted after police denied them authorisation to march to parlimentary buildings to petition against government's intention to rename the campus after a fallen national hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students opposed the proposed change of name for their institution to &quot;Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula,&quot; one of Zambia's veterans of the independence struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He became Lusaka's first African Minister of Education in the coalition government of 1962, two years before formal independence from Britain in 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students suspect that the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy of President Frederick Chiluba merely wants to exploit Nkumbula's name for political capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have charged that the university has so far won so much international acclaim and did not need to change its identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government had also proposed to change the name of the Lusaka International Airport to Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapwepwe was a firebrand politician in Zambia's struggle for independence and later held several government portfolios including that of foreign affairs minister. He later fell out with President Kaunda, who ruled Zambia for 27 years before being ousted by Chiluba. Kaunda is calling for a re-match in the 1996 Presidential elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENUGU, Nigeria (PANA) - Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, leader of defunct 'Biafra Republic' during Nigeria's civil war of 1967-70, has urged the military regime in the country to respect its transition to civilian rule programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Enugu, about 400 km south-east of Lagos, Ojukwu, a member of the recently dissolved Constitiutional Conference that submitted a draft constitution, said the 1 October date promised by Gen. Sani Abacha to announce the next stage of transition to democratic rule time-table was inviolable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was saddened by the recent statement credited to the Attorney-General of the Federation, Michael Agbamuche, that the period up to 1 October would be insufficient for the federal government to complete the consideration of the draft constituton.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ojukwu, who led the unsuccesfful Igbo rebellion said if Abacha had changed his mind on that date, the reasons should be &quot;so cogent that silly people such as myself, will hear them once and believe.&quot; The former Biafran leader is back from a visit to Britain, where he led a government delegation to see ailing Nigerian first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed to the governments of Britain and the United States to stop threatening Nigeria with sanctions to force her to enthrone a democratic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, Nigeria is on her way to democracy and cannot be said to be the most undemocratic nation in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The democratic content&quot; of the nigerian military regime was &quot;infinitely more than that of the Saudi Arabian government&quot;, he said, adding: &quot;yet nobody is sanctioning them (Saudi Arabia) for the lack of democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ojukwu also said there was &quot;nothing democratic about having a queen in England adding &quot;the House of Lords cannot be said to be democratic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We grant them their sovereignty, why can't they grant us our own,&quot; he said. Ojukwu, however, said it was not his wish that the world should impose economic sanctions on Nigeria or that the country should be expelled from the British-led Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Nigerians should go into dialogue with the military to ease them out of the scene and enthrone a democratic governement. Nigerians campaigning for economic sanctions against their fatherland, he said, should be careful so they do not multiply the nation's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;June 12 (the date of the 1993 presidential election annulled by the last military regime), is bad enough, but let us uunderstand that it was not as bad as the pogrom of the 1960s,&quot; a reference to the political crisis that led to Nigeria's civil war. Ojukwu added: &quot;we should try to solve problems, not live in problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the health of Azikiwe, who will be 91 in November, Ojukwu said the elder statesman was recovering from an attack of arthritis in a London hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he led a three-man government delegation to deliver Abacha's get-well message to Azikiwe, who was flown out a few weeks ago for medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ojukwu, who said the press briefing was to pacify anxieties among Nigerians over the former president's health, declared: &quot;whatever crisis that necessitated his (Azikiwe's) being rushed to england was over when we saw him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nine West African heads of state began gathering in the Nigerian capital of Abuja today to prepare for a summit to end the civil war in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, the chairman, sounded a warning that this could be the last chance for mediation by the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I have to put diplomacy aside,&quot; Rawlings told journalists, &quot;I will say we have reached the end of our limit.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The path to peace in Liberia, Africa's oldest republic, is littered with failures by the eight warring factions to bury their differences after six years of sivil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been some 50 peace conferences, mainly organized by Ecowas, of which Liberia is a member, and a dozen ceasefire agreements have been torn up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings and Nigerian military leader Gen. Sani Abacha conferred here Thursday night on ways to make Sunday's summit an exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said he hoped this would be the last Ecowas meeting on Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His a statement underlined the frustration felt by Ecowas, several of whose member states are maintaining a costly peacekeeping force in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria and Ghana have the largest number of troops, known by the acronym Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings hoped the next phase in the peace process would involve disarming the estimated 60,000 Liberian combatants who belong to several armed groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of Liberian warring factions, including Charles Taylor, who launched the rebellion against President Samuel Doe in December 1989, began another round of peace talks in Abuja Wednesday. Doe was later assassinated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 150,000 have been killed in the civil war, and many more have been wounded or driven into exile.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Elliot Mahende PANA Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUANDA, Angola (PANA) - Zimbabwean troops in the Third United Nations Verification Mission (Unavem III) in war-torn Angola are complaining about the cut in their monthly allowances by almost two-thirds by their government from the standard UN rate and now accuse it of seeking to profit from peacekeeping operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers interviewed in Luanda complained bitterly about the drastic cuts from the US dollar 988 (Zimdollars 8 398) per man per month contributed by the UN which is reduced to USD 350 (Zd2 975) by the time the money reaches the men in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disaffected officers, members of an 800-strong contingent in the 7 600-men peacekeeping force, are particularly bitter about the fact that the UN is paying for practically all the expenses incurred by the Zimbabwe government during the operation to oversee Angola's tortuous transition from nearly two decades of civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN guidelines on payments to governments contributing troops to the force, obtained at the Unavem III headquarters in the Angolan caoital Luanda, showed the governments contributing would be paid the standard rate of USD 988 for each solider every month for all ranks plus a supplementary USD 291 (zd2 473) per for a limited number of specialists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Payment for all items of clothing and equipment issued by governments to their troops is paid at a standard rate of USD 65 (Zd 552) per month while that for weaponry and ammunition is fixed at USD (Zd42) a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All such equipment and gear is retained by the troops at the end of the mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Payment is made directly to the troop contributing governments through their missions at the UN in New Yrk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of reduced allowances was also raised by Zimbabwean troops who participated in the failed Un operation in Somalia where the government also cut deeply into un allowances for peacekeepers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's defence minister Moven Mahachi has justified reducing the allowances for the troops on the grounds that the government continues to pay their salaries back home and that allowances by the UN should be reduced to that -- allowances to buy cigarettes and other things not supplied by the quartermaster in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahachi also argued that the government incurred expenses by sending troops into peacekeeping operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the disaffected officers dismissed this saying whatever expenses the government incurred, there was a credit balance for the Zimbabwean government at the end of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Being deployed here is really not worth the while considering what we are paid and the risks involved,&quot; said one officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, a Zimbabwean officer, Colonel Bernard Dungeni, tripped a mine in Lunda Norte province and lost his foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwean officers said it would be interesting to see whether the government would surrender all the money paid by the UN as compensation to Col. Dungeni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN regulations stipulate that the government make a claim to the world body upon the death or disablement of a peacekeeper in the field. What seemed to irk the officers more was that troops from other countries in the Unavem III operation were being given the UN allowances in full. Zimbabwean officers deployed as military observers were also better off than their peacekeeping counterparts since they get an allowance of USD 30 (Zd255) a day, a handsome package by Zimbabwean standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers also suggested that the Zimbabwean government deposit all extra funds from peacekeeping operations into a defence forces benefit fund if it was not keen to raise allowances for men in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some officers within the un itself appear to be getting uneasy about governments that cut heavily into allowances provided for troops with some arguing that the world body should not pay anything over and above what it costs the contributing governments to send troops into a peacekeeping operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others outside the UN system but whose governments are influential in determining UN budgets for peacekeeping operations have also expressed reservations about the conduct of some governments that contribute troops to peacekeeping operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the UN pays the contributing government (about) USD 1 000 per month for each soldier assigned to peacekeeping operations, many less developed nations have turned to peacekeeping as a source of revenue,&quot; said Professor James Corum of the US Air Force School of Advanced Airpower Studies at a recent conference on peacekeeping in Johannesburg, South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corum, drawing on experiences from Somalia, also attacked the UN peacekeeping funding system saying it promoted inefficient use of equipment, particulary the fact the UN also assumed the cost of maintaining military equipment provided by the participant nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabweans came out with decorations in Somalia despite the dangerous situation that prevailed in the lawless country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But angola, despite pronouncements of commitment to peace by both the Mpla government and Unita, remains a volatile country with a security problem compounded by an estimated 20 million landmines buried in the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maximum concentration by the peacekeepers is vital to avoid tripping the treacherous devices and problems of allowances should be the last thing on the mind of a soldier on such a delicate mission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerian military leader General Sani Abacha said on Sunday night his regime is working towards the restoration of democracy in the troubled West African nation. Abacha, who held a three-hour meeting with presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, said his administration was &quot;leaving no stone unturned&quot; in working toward that goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe and Museveni arrived in Abuja, the Nigerian capital Sunday, adding their weight to international pressure on the military ruler to release former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo and 39 other alleged coup plotters facing sentences ranging from execution to life imprisonment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this regard we are doing everything possible to establish a lasting basis for participatory democracy, social justice and sustainable growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We look forward to continued co-operation and understanding as we carry on this onerous task,&quot; said Abacha at a state banquet he hosted for the visiting leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of the three-hour long meeting held at state house earlier on were not immediately known nor did Abacha and Mugabe, who also spoke at the banquet, disclose specifics on the plight of the alleged coup plotters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe, who spoke on behalf of his Ugandan counterpart, said suspicions that Abacha was stalling on the issue of restoring democracy were &quot;misplaced&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West African nation of about 100 million people has been in turmoil since the army annulled the 12 June 1993 presidential elections widely believed to have been won by detained business tycoon Moshood Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwean leader took a swipe at the international media for &quot;misreporting&quot; the Nigerian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said following their &quot;excellent discussion&quot; with Abacha, the two leaders were satisfied that progress was being made towards restoring democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did agree that there was a way forward and we would like to support the way forward,&quot; said Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwean leader said given the diverse ethnic backgrounds of the Nigerian people, the country's problems were appreciable and could not be resolved over night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said the Nigerians should not be detracted from the efforts they were making towards restoring democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he would reporting back to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) leaders at their summit in Johannesburg next week on the progress Abacha was making towards restoring democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe's mission to nigeria follows a resolution at the last Presidential Forum on the Management of Science and Technology held in Kampala, Uganda, last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum, chaired by Museveni, mandated both Mugabe and Museveni to lead an initiative on Nigeria after Abacha had rebuffed a number of peace envoys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe, Museveni and Abacha were expected to continue their discussions on Monday morning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daily, ' El Engath el Watani' , said the secretary general of Sudan's High Council for Peace, Lino Rol Deng, had called on the UNHCR to prevent the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) from entering refugee camps in Eritrea, Kenya and Kenya to recruit refugees to fight government forces in southern Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council was established in 1994 to help bring an end to the 12-year civil war in the south by rallying southerners around the government programmes for peace and development. Deng himself is a southerner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Sudanese government sources there are about 29,000 Sudanese refugees in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number in Uganda fluctuates according to the military situation at the borders. It swells with increased fighting and falls when there is a lull in hostilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese government at one time estimated there were some 150,000 refugees in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eritrea has generally not been a sanctuary for southern Sudanese refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria (PANA) - Liberia's warring factions signed yet another peace accord in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, Sunday. It was the 13th agreement from 51 peace meetings on Liberia. Africa's oldest republic, Liberia was plunged into civil war on 24 December 1989.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest seven page document brokered by foreign ministers of the Ecowas Committee of Nine as well as OAU and United Nations facilitators, also sets up a six-member interim Council of State to run Liberia for 12 months until national elections are held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council is to be headed by an academic, Wilton Sankawolo, 55. The other members will be vice-chairmen of equal status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include Charles Taylor of the National Patriotic Front, Gen. Alhaji Kromah of Ulimo, George Boley Sr. of the Liberian Peace Council who is representing the ' Coalition Forces' , and Oscar Jaryee Quiah of the Liberian National Council. The other member of the council Tamba Tailor, who represents the traditional rulers, was earlier tipped to head the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt. Gen. Hezekiah Bowen of the Armed Forces of Liberia and Maj.Gen.  Roosevelt Johnson, who had earlier raised objections to the accord, later signed &quot;in the interest of peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the problematic issue of succession the agreement noted that &quot;in case of permanent incapacitation, a new chairman shall be appointed within the Ecowas framework.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transitional government is to be in place within 14 days from the signing of the accord while a new cease-fire and cessation of hostilities is to come into effect on 26 August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council chairman will not be allowed to participate in the first presidential and parliamentary elections while other interested members must resign their seats three months before the elections in order to be eligible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sankawolo was not in Abuja for the meeting, but the consensus among the warring factions as well as other liberian opinion leaders and the peace facilitators was that he would accept the post as a national service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abuja agreement was described as a supplement to the 1993 Cotonou (Benin) and the 1995 Akosombo (Ghana) accords on Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cease-fire will be monitored by Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warring factions were notorious for breaking previous accords. It remains to be seen whether the latest document will make the difference in a war that has killed more than 150,000 people and made refugees of almost half of Liberia's estimated 2.5 million population.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GABORONE, Botswana (PANA) - The Botswana government is being asked to emulate South Africa which recently abolished the death penalty. The latest call to abolish capital punishment has come from a local human rights centre, Ditshwanelo, following reports that President Ketumile Masire had rejected clemency appeals for three inmates-David Kelaletswe, David Bogatse and Tekoetsile Tsiane - currently on a death row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ditshwanelo said in a statement quoted by the Botswana News Agency (BOPA), the human rights group noted that the execution of the three men is now imminent while the outcome of clemency appeals for Patrick Ntesang and Obusitswe Tshabang have yet not been publicised.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rights centre said adherence to the rights to life and dignity and the right not to be subject to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment form part of the fundamental human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It regretted that the constitution of Botswana ignores these principles as it permits the use of the death penalty. The centre recalled that two months ago, the constitutional court of South Africa declared that death penalty was unconstitutional. Ditswhwanelo urged the government to recognise this deveopment and to consider similar constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While recognising the need to punish the perpetrators of heinous crime, the group said that any limitation of a right resulting from the punishment of a crime committed has to be reasonable and justified. &quot;In an open and democratic society which is based on freedom and equality such as Botswana, death penalty is neither reasonable nor justifiable,&quot; the human rights organisation said. It expressed hope that clemency appeals by Patrick Ntesang and Obusitswe Tshabang will be considered favourably.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Harare-based Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa Clearing House should redefine its operations as member states embark on monetary reforms under western-backed structural adjustment programmes, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening a two-day seminar on the future role of the institution in Harare RBZ governor Leonard Tsumba told 60 participants from sub-Saharan Africa that the role of the clearing house was now limited under the current wave of economic reforms sweeping across the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The decline in usage of the clearing house has coincided with the liberalisation of trade and foreign exchange regimes as part of the economic reform measures which many of our countries have been implementing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Under these economic reforms, export receipts no longer have to be surrendered to central banks. They are now retained in the inter-bank market, from which importers can source foreign exchange requirements,&quot; said Tsumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regional importers were now able buy foreign currency and pay their import requirements from the market without using the clearing house, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This development has increased the role of normal banking channels, but in the process, has limited the role of the clearing house,&quot; said Tsumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Central bank governors from sub-Saharan Africa had already questioned the continued relevance of the present clearing house facility to the region's payments arrangements, amid a decline in the usage of its travellers cheques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tsumba said the time had now come for the clearing house to chart the way forward under a liberalised foreign exchange regime in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The clearing house must increasingly be seen as a mechanism for promoting increased intra-regional trade or as an entity which provides non-traditional services,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Clearly such functions as are currently performed by the monetary division of the (Comesa) secretariat could be easily carried out by a reconstituted clearing house,&quot; suggested Tsumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The clearing house was established in February 1984, and operated from Harare under the auspices of the reserve bank of Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its main objective was to minimise usage of convertible currencies, and has since its inception been encouraged to accept national currencies in the settlement of trade transactions, and only subject net balances to payment in hard currency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by El Hassan, PANA Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - An exiled Sudanese opposition leader Mohamed Osman El Mirghani has reportedly expressed desire to return home, quit politics and terminate his relationship with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt, provided the government of Gen. Omar El Bashir returns his confiscated property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting what they described as a &quot;well placed political source&quot; Monday, two state-owned dailies El Engaz El Watani and El Sudan El Hadeith and an independent paper, Elra'I Elakhar, said Mirghani had sent an unnamed envoy on a secret mission to convey this message to Sudanese authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mirghani was leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which was dissolved when Gen. Bashir came to power in a military take-over on 30 June 1989.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dailies said the opposition leader wants to return home because he &quot;got fed up with the long stay abroad and with the bitter criticism directed to him as leader of the opposing national democratic alliance, from the alliance members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the free elections of 1986, the DUP came second in the result of public voting.the party then joined the majority party,the UMMA Party of former Premier Sadiq el Mahdi in a coalition government government ousted by Gen.Bashir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While welcoming Mirghani's return, the 'political source' is quoted as saying, the government would turn down any pre-conditions for such a return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The source said handing back Mirghani's property estimated at 25 billion Sudanese pounds (50 million US dollars would be a &quot;difficult&quot; consideration on grounds that he&quot;had accumulated this wealth from the simple followers of his religious sect, the Khatmiya, without practising any activity that could enable him to earn this money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The source said the opposition leader, who is now in Cairo, undertook in his message to &quot;content himself with leadership of his 'Khatmiya' religious sect and sever all of his existing firm ties with the egyptian regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the source said the Sudanese government respects Mirghani's religious leadership which,according to the source, has demonstrated its concern with the unity of the Sudan and its refusal to have foreign assistance for aborting the Sudanese Islamic project.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The source claimed he was disclosing Mirghani's story &quot; to prove that the DUP leader is only concerned with his person and with his wealth and to indicate that nobody (from the opposition) should dare to dictate conditions for his rerturn to Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - A detained Nigerian human rights activist and author, Ken Saro-Wiwa, will be among three recepients of this year's British Environment and Media Award for his commitment to raising awareness about environmental issues in Ogoniland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A release by the director of the award, Amanda Duncan-Smith, made available to PANA in Lagos said Saro-Wiwa was honoured for &quot;his continued commitment to the environment and the great efforts he has made to keep the problems and solutions in the forefront&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His public commitment and personal sacrifice have been most successful in keeping the debate alive&quot;, the release further said. Saro-Wiwa, leader of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), will share the award with Prince Charles of Wales, US Vice President Al Gore and British film producer/director Sir Richard Attenborough who, according to the release, have all made substantial contribution towards increasing public consciousness about environmental problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conceived in 1988 by Media Natural, a non-profit communications agency, the British Environmental Media Award executes a wide range of media projects and ensures high standards in the communication of environmental issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saro-Wiwa, a television producer and author of several books, has often accused Nigeria's military administrations and oil companies of causing environmental degradation of Ogoninland and genocide against his tribe, the Ogoni, located in the heartland of the country's oil-rich Rivers State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has taken his case to the International Court of Justice at the Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saro-Wiwa is currently being held behind bars for allegedly ordering the murder of four prominent people of Ogoniland opposed to his movement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Lionel Williams, Pana Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG (PANA)- The South African Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs has granted a prospecting permit to the Duo Corporation of South Africa to search for diamonds in the Matshakatini Reserve on the border with Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to David Lindley, conservation ecologist of the Wildlife Society of Southern Africa, the decision poses a threat of enormous long term environmental damage to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 29-thousand hectare provincial nature reserve in the northern province of South Africa -- also know at the Madimbo Corridor -- borders on the Limpopo River and shares its eastern boundary with the famous one-million hectare Kruger National Park. The reserve is currently controlled and managed by the South African National Defence Force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Matshakatini Reserve forms a vital link in the plans of the 'golden horseshoe&quot;, a vision that aims at linking nature reserves in Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. In South Africa this would stretch from the Kruger National Park in the East, along the Limpopo River to the north and down the Western border of the Northern Province with Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wildlife Society says it is extremely concerned the decision to grant the prospecting permit was made without all the facts being known. The society says in principle it is not against mining in the area, but that other options for the alternate land use, such as ecotourism and farming, have been totally ignored. It says the land use must benefit the local people, the province and the country as a whole and take into account the social, ecological and economic environments. Only then can a sound decision be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wildlife Society says it tried to alert the ministers of environment and tourism and of mineral and energy affairs, as well as defence, as to the importance of the area as early as January this year. However, no reply was received until the decision to grant the prospecting permit had been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mutelo tribe, who live in the area and who can lay historic claim to the land, was not consulted in the matter, nor were the Kruger National Park authorities and the Northern Province Nature Conservation who, together with the Mutele tribe, favors the ecotourism route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To complicate the matter, says the Wildlife Society, it appears with growing evidence that the decision to grant the permit was far from transparent and for that reason it had been forced to raise public awareness on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to ecologists the area has a 60-kilometre stretch of rare virgin Limpopo River Gallery Forest, a unique pan system on the floodplain, a sensitive sand forest and hundreds of boabab trees more than a thousand years old. In addition it is the migrating passage for wildlife moving to and from South Africa into Zimbabwe. The Wildlife Society says leading South African archeologists are of the opinion that the Limpopo River Valley forms the seat of sub-Saharan African civilization, dating back to the Mapungumwe culture of 600-700 A.D. Excavations in other parts of the valley in the Kruger National Park, as well as in Botswana and Southern Zimbabwe, have revealed strong evidence to support this theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential the Matshakatini Reserve shows of becomming a treasure trove is indeed great. Stone-age flint knives probally dating back a million years have already been found and pottery discovered in a river bank, most likely fron the period 600 700 A.D.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Paul Ejime PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria (PANA) - The West African force in Liberia, Ecomog, badly needs financial and logistics support now that the country's warring factions have signed an agreement to end the civil war, its Commander Brig. Gen.. John Mark Inienger said Tuesday in Abuja, Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are assuring the heads of state of Ecowas and the international community that we are not lacking in men, but we need financial resources and logistics to support the troops,&quot; he told PANA in the Nigerian Federal Capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the latest peace accord, the 13th signed by the warring factions Sunday, Ecomog is to oversee the disarmament of an estimated 60,000 combatants belonging to different factions in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inienger said that due to lack of progress in the peace process, the peace force had been cut down to an estimated 8,000 troops from a peak of about 15,000 in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations, he said, had also scaled down its observers and threatened to pull them out completely by 15 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Ecomog commander said with the signing of the new accord, which goes into effect in the first week of September, he &quot;is hopeful&quot; the Ecowas heads of state and the UN would be encouraged to support the peace-keeping force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the suggestion that the force should engage in peace enforcement in case of violation of the accord, inienger stated that Ecomog's mission is not to &quot;usurp the sovereignty of Liberia, but to assist Liberians restore peace in their country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the Abuja accord as a &quot;new page in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">peace process,&quot; adding that for the first time all the warring factions had undertaken to work for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to accusations by some factions that Ecomog</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was biased against some of them, Inienger said it was normal in conflict situation for parties to seek to protect their interests. The Liberian war, he said, lacks ideology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The factions are fighting for jobs and positions, so you should expect such misunderstanding,&quot; Inienger argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Ecomog Commander said with the appointment of a neutral person, 55-year-old lecturer Wilton Sankawolo, to head the transitional council of state for 12 months, he was hopeful of peace in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian war has killed more than 150,000 people, including president Samuel Doe, the target of the rebellion launched by National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) leader Charles Taylor on 24 December 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inienger, a former state governor in Nigeria, is the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">longest-serving Ecomog Commander, having spent some 20 months in command of the force sent to Monrovia in August 1990 by the Economic Community of West African States.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to enter the textile industry could get assistance from the University of Massachusetts in terms of expertise and machinery, a visiting official from the American state said here Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The promise was made by Mr Franklin Ollivierre, a representative of the Massachusetts Governor, who has been leading a trade mission here on a two-day visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ollivierre told the Botswana Press Agency (BOPA) in Gaborone Tuesday that his trip to Botswana was a follow up of a similar trip made to Boston by authorities from the southern African country four months ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that when he goes back home, he will help to spread the good word about Botswana's friendly investment climate. &quot;More than anything else people need to know more about Botswana,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the country could attract foreign investors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because of its stable economy and political climate, its peaceful elections and a long history of stability and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He particularly talked of the government's policy of free trade and the tax regime, tare all conducive to foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ollivierre said possible areas of investment discussed with Gaborone's authorities include solar energy, education and training , telecommunications and financial services. He said however, there is need to do follow-up on the last two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking about his mission's tangible results, he said a local businessman interested in solar energy was able to have a business contact in the united states after meeting his delegation Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ollivierre said his team came to Botswana to reciprocate a visit made by traded mission led by Gaborone's Ambassador to Washington, Kingsley Sebele and the Permanent Secretary to the ministry of Commerce and Industry, Tswelelopele Moremi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Lionel Williams, PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG (PANA)- The South African Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs has granted a prospecting permit to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Duo Corporation of South Africa to search for diamonds in the Matshakatini Reserve on the border with Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to David Lindley, conservation ecologist of the Wildlife Society of Southern Africa, the decision poses a threat of enormous long term environmental damage to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 29-thousand hectare provincial nature reserve in the northern province of South Africa -- also know at the Madimbo Corridor -- borders on the Limpopo River and shares its eastern boundary with the famous one-million hectare Kruger National Park. The reserve is currently controlled and managed by the South African National Defence Force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Matshakatini Reserve forms a vital link in the plans of the ' golden horseshoe&quot;, a vision that aims at linking nature reserves in Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. In South Africa this would stretch from the Kruger National Park in the East, along the Limpopo River to the north and down the Western border of the Northern Province with Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wildlife Society says it is extremely concerned the decision to grant the prospecting permit was made without all the facts being known. The society says in principle it is not against mining in the area, but that other options for the alternate land use, such as ecotourism and farming, have been totally ignored. It says the land use must benefit the local people, the province and the country as a whole and take into account the social, ecological and economic environments. Only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">then can a sound decision be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wildlife Society says it tried to alert the ministers of environment and tourism and of mineral and energy affairs, as well as defence, as to the importance of the area as early as January this year. However, no reply was received until the decision to grant the prospecting permit had been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mutelo tribe, who live in the area and who can lay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">historic claim to the land, was not consulted in the matter, nor were the Kruger National Park authorities and the Northern Province Nature Conservation who, together with the Mutele tribe, favors the ecotourism route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To complicate the matter, says the Wildlife Society, it appears with growing evidence that the decision to grant the permit was far from transparent and for that reason it had been forced to raise public awareness on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to ecologists the area has a 60-kilometre stretch of rare virgin Limpopo River Gallery Forest, a unique pan system on the flood plain, a sensitive sand forest and hundreds of baobab trees more than a thousand years old. In addition it is the migrating passage for wildlife moving to and from South Africa into Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wildlife Society says leading South African archeologists are of the opinion that the Limpopo River Valley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forms the seat of sub-Saharan African civilization, dating back to the Mapungumwe culture of 600-700 A.D. Excavations in other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">parts of the valley in the Kruger National Park, as well as in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana and Southern Zimbabwe, have revealed strong evidence to support this theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential the Matshakatini Reserve shows of becoming a treasure trove is indeed great. Stone-age flint knives probably dating back a million years have already been found and pottery discovered in a river bank, most likely from the period 600 700 A.D.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Felix Njoku PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - An extraordinary meeting of the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank (ADB) begins in Abidjan Thursday for a rerun of polling for the president of the bank, called off in May in Abuja following a deadlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A release from the bank's base in Cote d'Ivoire said the board will on 25 August still have to choose from among the three major candidates who failed to clinch the job in the Nigerian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are Timothy Thehane of Lesotho, currently a Vice-President at the World Bank, Morocco's former Economy Minister, Omar Kabbaj and Seyyid Abdulai of Nigeria, currently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary-General of the Opec Fund for International Development in Vienna, Austria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thehane, was leading with 44.59 per cent of the votes against 35.68 per cent for Kabbaj and Abdulahi's 19.73 per cent when polling reached a deadlock in Abuja on 25 May.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thehane or Kabbaj needed the support of Nigeria to clinch the job but it refused to give way charging non-regional members of influencing the voting for selfish reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To become President of the ADB, the candidate needs at least 50.1 per cent of the regional (50 African countries) votes, and 50.1 per cent of the Non-regional (26 Non-African countries) votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say Nigeria's behaviour at the Abidjan meeting would determine whether a new chief executive would be found for the continental development bank set up in 1963 by African governments to foster Africa's development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has the highest shareholding of 10.5 per cent at the bank. The government floated one of its two soft loan affiliates ' Nigeria Trust Fund' currently estimated to be worth 400,000 US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian officials insist that the non-regional members who did not cast a single vote for their candidate, were bent on hijacking the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had tried to do this by a variety of means including starving the African Development Fund (ADF) of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now they want to get a subterfuge to convert ADB into some funny sort of World Bank,&quot; said a Nigerian official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America has a monopoly of the Presidency of the World Bank. Japan Heads the Asian Development Bank; so why will Nigeria be denied the top position at the ADB...?&quot;, he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the non-regional members who provide the quasi-totality of loanable funds of the bank through contributions to the ADF, argue that Nigeria's political and economic credentials were not clean enough to give her top job at the multilateral</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument in Abuja was that if Abdulai got the post, he would be under the direct influence of the Nigerian military government and this would discourage international financiers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from doing business with the ADB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, some shareholders say these arguments have become irrelevant considering the urgent need to provide the bank with a substantive head to replace Babacar Ndiaye, the Senegalese national who has held the post for more than the statutory two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terms of 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndiaye was due to depart after the Abuja Assembly but was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">asked to stay on until 31 August, to allow for the election of a new president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ADB, with authorised capital of 23.7 billion dollars (31 December 1994) has had five presidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were Mamoun Beheiry of Sudan from 1964 to 1970; Abdel Wahab Labidi (late) of Tunisia (1970-1976); Kwame Donkor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fordwor of Ghana (1976-1979); Goodall Gondwe of Malawi who acted from 1979-1980; Wila D. Mung'Omba of Zambia from 1980 to 1985 and incumbent Ndiaye who was elected President in 1985.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - A human rights organisation on Tuesday here said Zimbabwe was saddled with an undemocratic government which had rigged last April's parliamentary elections to stay in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement, the Southern African Human Rights Foundation (SAHRF), said the nullification of the election results for Harare south constituency confirmed that elections were rigged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Harare south constituency revelations were only the very tip of the iceberg as rigging, fraudulent activities and intimidation of voters in various ways were part of governments broad strategy to stay in power,&quot; the rights group said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An independent candidate in the elections, Margaret Dongo, won her petition in the high court to have the Harare south constituency's results nullified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She had sought nullification of the result on grounds that there had been irregularities which distorted the results of the poll in which the candidate of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union _atriotic Front (ZANU PF), Vivian Wwashita, was declared winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAHRF accused government of promoting what it termed foreign economic colonialisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The real government in Zimbabwe is no longer ZANU PF but the foreign office in London and the state department in the USA,&quot; said SAHRF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Forum Party of Zimbabwe (FPZ) also said in a statement recently that it believed the elections were rigged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party's secretary for publicity and information, James Dzvova, said irregularites that surfaced in the Harare south election were planned and implemented with the full knowledge and connivance by the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A constitutional conference, he said should be convened immediately to come up with a new constitution to be followed by fresh elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the event of ZANU PF refusing to convene an all party constitutional conference, the FPZ will have no alternative but to take ZANU PF to the supreme court for redress,&quot;said dzvova.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria (PANA) - The West African force in Liberia, Ecomog, badly needs financial and logistics support now that the country's warring factions have signed an agreement to end the civil war, its Commander Brig.Gen. John Mark Inienger said Tuesday in Abuja, Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are assuring the heads of state of Ecowas and the international community that we are not lacking in men, but we need financial resources and logistics to support the troops,&quot; he told PANA in the Nigerian Federal Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the latest peace accord, the 13th signed by the warring factions Sunday, Ecomog is to oversee the disarmament of an estimated 60,000 combatants belonging to different factions in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inienger said that due to lack of progress in the peace process, the peace force had been cut down to an estimated 8,000 troops from a peak of about 15,000 in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations, he said, had also scaled down its observers and threatened to pull them out completely by 15 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Ecomog commander said with the signing of the new accord, which goes into effect in the first week of September, he &quot;is hopeful&quot; the Ecowas heads of state and the UN would be encouraged to support the peace-keeping force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the suggestion that the force should engage in peace enforcement in case of violation of the accord, inienger satated that Ecomog's mission is not to &quot;usurp the sovereignty of Liberia, but to assist Liberians restore peace in their country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He described the Abuja accord as a &quot;new page in the peace process,&quot; adding that for the first time all the warring factions had undertaken to work for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to accusations by some factions that Ecomog was biased against some of them, Inienger said it was normal in conflict situation for parties to seek to protect their interests.The liberian war, he said, lacks ideology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The factions are fighting for jobs and positions, so you should expect such misunderstanding,&quot; Inienger argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Ecomog Commader said with the appointment of a neutral person, 55-year-old lecturer Wilton Sankawolo, to head the transitional council of state for 12 months, he was hopeful of peace in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Liberian war has killed more than 150,000 people, including president Samuel Doe, the target of the rebellion launched by National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) leader Charles Taylor on 24 December 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inienger, a former state governor in Nigeria, is the longest-serving Ecomog Commander, having spent some 20 months in command of the force sent to Monvoria in August 1990 by the Economic Community of West African States.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - University of Zimbabwe (UZ) Vice-Chancellor prof.  Gordon Chavunduka said on Tuesday the situation at the institution has returned to normal after about two months of disturbances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chavunduka said in an interview that 12 members of the Students' Representative Council (SRC) and seven other UZ workers whose suspensions were lifted last week were now back on campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said three other SRC members still on suspension would soon appear before the disciplinary committee, although no specific date had been set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have appointed a commission of inquiry which has already started its work and will report back soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They will investigate the causes of the recent disturbances and make recommendations on how (the recent) and other disturbances in the University can be avoided in future, among other things,&quot; said Chavunduka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the University had lifted the suspension of the 19 students and workers after the University's legal office found them not directly responsible for disturbances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three src members still on suspension are President Obey Mudzingwa, Vice-President Brian Kagoro and the Secretary-General Tinomudaishe Chinyoka, while three other students are also still on suspension as they were suspected of inciting disturbances and disrupting the institution's teaching programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The University had been rocked by demonstrations, clashes between police and students, and outright destruction of property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria not only lost the right to host the Under-21 world soccer tournament to Qatar, it also lost a substantial amount of money due to mismanagement, a government panel has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presenting its report Wednesday in Lagos, The panel on the cancelled Nigeria'95 local organising committee's activities told Sports Minister Jim Nwobodo that vouchers of up to 807 million naira were reported missing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said contracts were awarded without proper procedure. (There are 82 naira to one u.s. dollar in the open market).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four stadia as well as communications, health and transports facilities were upgraded at the cost of millions of dollars for the tournament, which was to have taken place in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the world soccer governing body FIFA cancelled Nigeria's bid citing security reasons. It took the championship to the Gulf state of Qatar.  Nigeria lost its protest and appeal for reparation from FIFA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nwobodo said at least 63 million naira would be refunded by some of the contractors to government. He also pledged that government would punish anyone involved in stealing funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nwobodo said about 238 million naira was the balance in the comittee's account and a letter of credit with the Central Bank of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON (PANA) - Ghana Starlets return home to a heroic welcome in Accra Thursday after winning the World Under-17 soccer championship in Ecuador, South America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they emerged African champions after whipping Nigeria 3-1 in Mali, the Ghanaians left no doubt of their intention to snatch the world championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Mali they embarked on a European tour, winning five of six warm-up matches played before flying to Quito, the Ecuadorean capital, for the world title. They did not lose any of the trial matches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 3-20 August, 16 countries, including ecuador and 15 other qualifiers (three from each continent), began the campaign for the third Fifa Under-17 championship and fifth tournament overall since Nigeria won the maiden 1985 event in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinea and Nigeria were the other African teams in Ecuador -- Nigeria appearing as Africa's second-best qualifier and defending champion and Guinea, the bronze medalist at Mali '95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana scored five goals and conceded one in group A matches in which Ecuador, Japan and the United States also played. Ghana bagged the maximum nine points from the three matches, winning 1-0 against Japan, 2-1 against Ecuador and 2-0 against the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the quaterfinals, the Ghanaians obliterated European champions Portugal 2-0.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinea bade farewell to the event during the group B playoffs but not before coming from two goals down to beat Portugal 3-2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In group C in Rio Bamba, the coldest venue in Ecuador (which in Spanish means equator), defending champions Nigeria struggled to a 1-1 draw with Qatar on 4 August. But Nigeria defeated Oceania champions Australia 2-0 and sent Spain home 2-1 to lead the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerians then travelled to Porto Viejo, a town as muggy as Lagos, only to lose 3-1 to third-rate Asian qualifier Oman. The Omanis had earned the tag &quot;giant killers&quot; for their victory run in the contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's loss to Oman sent shockwaves around the surviving teams, including Ghana, whose semi-final opponents were the same Omanis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghanaian coach Samuel Arday did not mince words. He paid glowing tribute to the Gulf team but added that he was out to win and, at least, restore the traditional African supremacy at the world youth soccer level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will retaliate on behalf of Nigeria,&quot; he told the Pan African News Agency on the eve of the match with Oman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His prophecy came true. Ghana outplayed Oman 3-1 in Porto Viejo as Brazil surprisingly defeated a very mobile Argentina 3-0 in the other semi-final encounter in Quayaquil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final between Brazil and Ghana at the Isidro Romero Carbo stadium -- owned by top clubside Barcelona FC of Quayaquil-- was as magnificent as the 90,000 capacity facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argentina subdued Oman 2-0 for the third-place match before the expected &quot;soccer samba&quot; from the Brazilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Ghana's impressive climb to the finals Brazil remained odds on favorites. But the Ghana routed Brazil, beating the colourful South Americans at their own game -- &quot;soccer samba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 38th minute Baba Sule, captain Emmanuel Bentil in the 43rd and David Amoako in the 49th, underlined Ghanaian supremacy over a traditionally world soccer powerhouse, Brazil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana 3-2 victory over Brazil was not the issue. Rather, it was the lopsided nature of the match in which the Brazilians almost looked liked novices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghanaian player of note was midfielder Awudu Issaka. He single-handedly tore the Brazilian team into shreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one occasion, the Brazilians were so stunned they lost possession for eight straight minutes as the Ghanaians played ball to the delight of the 90,000 spectators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's double victory equals Nigeria's record of winning the trophy twice and runner-up once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria won the championship in 1985, was runner-up in 1987 and regained the trophy in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Ghanaians, Ecuador '95 was their third successive final. They won in 1991 and were runners-up to Nigeria in 1993 before this Quayaquil triumph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing remained clear after Irish referee Irvine Leslie blew his final whistle on 20 August: soccer supremacy at the world youth level remains the exclusive preserve of the African continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's military ruler General Sani Abacha has appointed Innocent Oparadike Sole administrator of the Daily Times of Nigeria (DTN) company, publishers of the authoritative pro-government 'Daily Times', in replacement of Tunji Oseni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from information and culture minister Walter Ofonagoro received Tuesday in Lagos said the appointment was with immediate effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oparidike, 45, one-time editor-in-chief of the government owned 'New Nigerian&quot; newspaper and former information and culture commissioner of Imo State in eastern Nigeria, obtained a first class honours degree in mass communications from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, in 1976 and a masters degree from the University of Lagos in 1981.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a pioneer member of staff of the News Agency of Nigeria (Nan) fom where he went to the now postcribed National Concord newspapers, owned by detained millionnaire businessman Moshood Abiola, where he served as the group political editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He became the editor of The Democrat in 1983 and later editor of New Nigeria newspapers, up to 1987, when he moved to the Mass Mobilisation for Social and Economic Reconstrution directorate where he was national director for information and publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until his appointment, Oparadike was the managing director of Freedom Communications Limited in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunji Oseni, the outgoing chief executive of Nigeria's largest circulation newspaper, was appointed managing director of the company in 1993 by the shortlived interim national government of industrialist Ernest Shonekan.  Although no official reason was given for Oseni's sudden removal, it had been predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'AM News', a daily, in Saturday's issue reported that information minister Walter Ofonagoro, whose ministry supervises the DTN was not &quot;comfortable&quot; with Oseni's activities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by John Makamure, Pana Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG (PANA) - The stage is set for the annual summit of the Southern African Development Community in Johannesburg, where leaders will discuss progress towards regional integration and the effects of the current drought on the fragile economies of some of the 11 member countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit proceedings, which started on 22 August, will culminate with the meeting of the heads of state and government at the city's World Trade Centre on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the Sadc leaders are expected to attend the summit, being held in South Africa for the first since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sadc members comprise Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's drought comes after Sadc countries were still recovering from another devastating dry period in 1991/92, which forced member states to import large quantities of food to avert mass starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the height of the 1992 drought, more than 18 million people in the Sadc needed food handouts and assistance with seed packs and fertiliser to prepare for the 1993 farming season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high costs of importing food led to a diversion of large sums of money that could have been used to supported the integration process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - The picture showing President Nelson Mandela's torn sock has won the photographer who took it the Best Photo Award for 1994 in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, according to the Johannesburg correspondent of a Zairean weekly, L'Observateur (The Observer), the photo-journalist who caught it, Ken OOsterboek, was killed in April 1994 while covering post-election violent incidents in Tokoza Township East of South Africa's economic capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late OOsterboek's camera caught Mandela taking an inaugural shot at the ball during a soccer match. In the process, one shoe slipped off, revealing the sock with a gaping hole through which the president's big toe portruded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail Kriel, the valet who takes care of Mandela's dressing at the president's official residence in Pretoria has said he was deeply &quot;embarrassed&quot; by the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in his defence, Kriel was quoted as saying Mandela had two other residencies in South Africa.&quot;One cannot therefore know for sure from which he was dressed up on that day,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Yusuf Surtee, the courturier who has been clothing Mandela since he came out of the apartheid gaols in 1990, told the South African Press Association (SAPA) that Nelson Mandela was very particular about the quality of socks he wore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, in a statement published by the mass circulation 'Sowetan' newspaper, which is popular among black South African readers, Surtee claimed that the president had deliberately cut his sock to bring relief to his swollen toe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The torn sock of Nelson Mandela was in April chosen by the South African media as the best picture for 1994. There is tradition in that country to give awards to the best written articles, reporting or photographs published by diverse newspapers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit proceedings, which started on 22 August, will culminate with the meeting of the heads of state and government at the city's World Trade Centre on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the Sadc leaders are expected to attend the summit, being held in South Africa for the first since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadc members comprise Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's drought comes after Sadc countries were still recovering from another devastating dry period in 1991/92, which forced member states to import large quantities of food to avert mass starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the height of the 1992 drought, more than 18 million people in the Sadc needed food handouts and assistance with seed packs and fertiliser to prepare for the 1993 farming season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high costs of importing food led to a diversion of large sums of money that could have been used to supported the integration process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Ferdinand Bigumandondera PANA Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi (PANA) - A former Burundi head of state says his country is now in a state of civil war between rival extremists fighting for supremacy -- the majority Hutus on the one hand, and the army-led minority Tutsis on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians and military chiefs have pointedly avoided the term &quot;war&quot; to characterize two years of ethnic conflict, triggered by the assassination of the nation's first Hutu president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a grim analysis of the burgeoning strife that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives Maj. Pierre Buyoya said in an interview today that ambitious politicians had fanned the flames of feuding into fullscale civil war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya, Burundi's last Tutsi president, identified the two warring factions as:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- &quot;Hutu militias who wage civil war with a visible aim, strategy and action plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Tutsi militias which &quot;kill, destabilise and pillage, probably under various commands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said politicians were behind the crisis and evidently had &quot;one foot in power and another in the militias.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya's word carries weight both in Burundi and abroad. After overthrowing Col. Jean-Baptiste Bagaza to seize power in 1987 Buyoya organized the first democratic elections that yielded Melchior Ndadaye as the first Hutu head of state in June 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndadaye was assassinated four months later in an attempted military coup led by Tutsi officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya said Burundi was also going through a diplomatic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The image of Burundi is disastrous. One has the impression that the country is very seriously attacked. But there is nobody to defend it abroad,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Burundi must &quot;develop a strategy for the preservation of peace, strongly fight against warmongers, develop a diplomatic strategy to support peace and end the government indecision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the London-based human rights watchdog body Amnesty International condemned neighbouring Zaire for expelling thousands of refugees from camps there to their homes in Burundi and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These acts of refoulement constitute a clear violation of international law ... and are certain to contribute to an escalation of tension in the region,&quot; an Amnesty statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization expressed fears that some of the million or so refugees, mainly Hutus, could face death at the hands of Tutsis on their return. They might also be denied humanitarian aid now available in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty appealed to Zaire to stop the repatriation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The ecological monitoring centre of Dakar, Senegal (CSE), is developing a West African programme for bushfire control with a test phase involving Guinea, Mali, and Senegal, according to authorised sources in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sub-regional project results from the combination of the will of donors and Senegalese expertise in the field,&quot; according to Racine Kane, a CSE programme manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Guinea, he said, CSE is, in cooperation with local forestry services, conducting a test programme on creating bushfire awareness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project, funded by the Swiss government, uses to a rural radio network to disseminate information on bushfires and data received every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mali, the CSE initiative has so far resulted in activities including the transfer of data to the various ministries involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1991-1992, satellite monitoring helped in assessments of the part played by bushfires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kane, the priority given to Guinea is related to the fact that the basins of the Senegal and Gambia rivers are located in that country which is also crossed by the Niger River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The frequency of bushfires in the country is a threat to the balance of the ecosystems of the three rivers which are important at the regional level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSE's expertise in monitoring the phenomenon has been developed over the years since 1990 when the centre developed a programme to supplement the efforts of the Senegalese Forestry and Soil Conservation Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The monitoring is carried out by satellite and data are collected twice a day by a reception centre in operation in Dakar since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the centre's operation, pictures were ordered from the Spanish Maspalomas Centre, in the Canary Islands. But they usually reached CSE after two weeks of having been taken, making it impossible to ensure monitoring in real time. As a result, warnings could not be issued early enough to help put an end to the bushfires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to CSE experts, pictures taken at night show clearly where the active fires are whereas pictures taken by day are more useful in assessing burnt areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the dry season 1993-1994 season some 750,000 hectares were burnt with 1,677 cases of bush fires having been reported in Senegal alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fires are more recurrent during the December-January-February quarter when the grass is dense and relatively dry, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bushfire monitoring project is part of a large-scale programme of cooperation between the United Nations Sahel Office (Unso) and the Danish Agency for International Cooperation (Danida), on the one hand, and CSE and the Senegalese government, on the other.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian farmers have been advised to grow drought-resistant food crops to help make the country self-sufficient in food under current dry circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Minister Suresh Desai said in Lusaka 22 August that farmers had an obligation to assist the country break its dependence on imported maize, to mitigate the effects of famine due to the drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke at a one-day symposium on the the effects of drought on Zambian agriculture, solutions and strategies of soil management.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's Southern and Eastern regions, both traditional maize producing areas, have been hit by drought in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agriculture ministry has worked out logistics to put in place a new programme called &quot;Zero Tillage&quot;. It is meant to boost food output in drought-stricken areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desai said government had already set aside one billion kwacha (about 920 Kwacha = 1 U.S. dollar) for the programme. At least 2,000 farmers in Luangwa, eastern Zambia will benefit from the first phase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project will teach farmers to switch to hoe-tilling and thereby reduce ground water evaporation. Crops like sorghum, soya beans, millet and groundnuts are drought resistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But speaking at the same meeting the Vice-Chancellor of The University Of Zambia, Andrew Siwela, said government must fashion a long-term solution to the drought problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it would be more beneficial to invested funds in drought monitoring and research to establish the causes and correct the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would recommend that drought relief include support to all these complementary areas rather than just the procurement and distribution of relief food,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, he said government should set up a multi-disciplinary, permanent drought monitoring and research team. Its main task would be to examine the drought problem in detail and recommend practical measures to correct or eliminate the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government released some 90,000 tonnes of food relief Friday to help at least 1.3 million people in the 31 worst drought hit districts in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Southern, Lusaka, Eastern, Central and Western provinces are also among the adversely hit areas by the drought.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Sudanese army units and Ugandan rebels, led by a former minister of dictator Idi Amin, have attacked government soldiers in Oraba, northern Uganda, the state-owned New Vision newspaper reported Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that the rebels, calling themselves the West Nile Bank and headed by a renegade Colonel, Juma Oris, crossed into Uganda and attacked the border post Sunday. Oraba is about a kilometre South of the common border with Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper gave no figures of calsualties or of the invadors. It said Sudanese soldiers were still in Oraba Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cited the country's Second Deputy Prime Minster Eric Adriko as saying that army and police units had earlier been withdrawn from the post because of fighting between Sudanese troops and the rebel Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army. They are fighting for control of Kaya, the most southerly Sudanese border town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan Foreign Affairs Minister Ruhakana Rugunda handed over a protest note Monday for Sudan to te Libyan ambassador in Uganda, Abdallah Bujeldian.  Libya is mediating between Uganda and Sudan and is the trustee of Sudanese interests in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(The) Uganda government calls upon and demands that the Sudan government puts an end to the incursions into uganda,&quot; Rugunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If not, the government will be left with no option but to take whatever actions is deems necessary to counter the provocation and aggression unleashed to the innocent people of Kitgum, Gulu, Moyo and Arua in defence of their lives and property.&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited incidents when rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army, another group, invaded Uganda from Sudan. It said on July 26 about 500 of these rebels dressed in Sudanese army uniforms and armed by Sudan with anti-aircraft missiles, mortars and personal weapons crossed into Uganda from Palutaka in Sudan and attacked Padibe two days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the attack, he said, three civilians died, four were injured and 10 were abducted. He said homesteads were burnt and merchandise looted or destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned many other attacks from Sudan and said that in 1995 Khartoum had directly or indirectly caused suffering to people of Uganda &quot;in well over 50 incidents.&quot; It said Sudan trained and gave sanctuary to rebels around Morobo, Mahajub and Alebo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sudan has countinued to provoke, disturb, kill people, violate Uganda's territory, kidnap and sell Ugandan children for guns through her proxies like Joseph Kony,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rugunda said a peace missions with the arbitration oflibya and Malawi might fail if Sudan continued attacking Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation, rather than improving has infact worsened,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda severed diptomatic relations with Sudan on April 23, after accusing Khartoum of assisting Kony's rebels who have since distabilised security in the northern part of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, Khartoum has accused Kampala of aiding anti-government rebels who continue to attack Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to Monday's killing by mortar fire in Central Sarajevo of 30 person and injury of 80, the foreign ministry in Khartoum issued a statement Tuesday saying this &quot; was an indication that the international organisation has failed to carry out its duty towards the protection of the safe heavens it created in Bosnia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This incident could be rated as a conspiracy on the part of the united nations,even a coordination between the United Nations and the Serb aggressors under a continued arms embargo against the Republic of Bosnia that denied its people the right to defend themselves,&quot;said the statement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has rejected as unjustified a proposal by banks to offer a special financing facility for drought-hit commercial farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the proposal, the Central Bank said it will not support a scheme that is both highly inflationary and designed to favour a select few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU), which has been pushing for special interest rates for farmers whose debt exceeds zimdollars 3 billion (253 million U.S dollars), expressed shock at the decision.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank said it was &quot;committed to discouraging support of any action which might have an adverse impact on money growth and, hence, inflation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank said farmers and banks would have to sit down and find other solutions to ease their viability crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The special financing facility was proposed by the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe which had asked the RBZ that banks be allowed to use statutory reserve funds to reschedule the debt of farmers, as well as finance production costs in the 1995/96 season, now less than three months away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same funds, the banks suggested, could also finance projects in the small and medium-scale sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The farmers had asked for rescheduling, at favourable interest rates, of the equivalent of 94 million U.S dollars out of an accumulated debt of 353 million U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the farmers said they would require another three billion Zimbabwe dollars to finance production this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its response to the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe President, Sij Biyam, the RBZ said it found it &quot;difficult&quot;' to justify assistance to a particular sector of the economy at the expense of others who were equally affected by the drought and punitive interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CFU President, Peter Macsporran, responding to the decision by the RBZ, expressed &quot;deep regret&quot;, and told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency (ZIANA) the union was now asking for an urgent meeting with all concerned to discuss the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RBZ said there was need to formulate and implement long-term, measures to deal with the drought, and suggested that farmers should establish a drought insurance scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Bank said among the proposals by the bankers, there was no mention of &quot;any significant&quot; contribution by the banks towards assisting the farmers, &quot;especially in light of the banks' current favourable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We suggest that the banks should give consideration to rescheduling the loans and also examine recapitalisation as measures aimed at finding long-term solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RBZ said banks could also finance farmers from proceeds of selling agricultural bonds, which could have a tenure of up to three years and were issued at favourable interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate interview, president of the bankers association, Sij Biyam, confirmed their proposals had been rejected by the RBZ and as of now, each individual farmer would be treated on his on merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biyam said farmers had to realise government was against subsidies under its market reform programme, and that the productive sector would have to use their own resources to stay in business.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview Tuesday, Kerne Mackie of Copro, a trading company of Zimbabwe's Ostrich Producers Association, said the country was waiting for an EU rating following the of an Ostricj abbatoir.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The abattoir, one of the world's state of the art ostrich facilities, was built to stringent EU standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mackie said Copro was receiving a lot of export enquiries from countries including South Africa. The company last month exported 78 live ostriches to China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The industry is growing very fast,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She attributed the boom in demand for ostrich meat for its rich protein but low cholestoral levels, in spite its being red.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quality is the same of that of super beef,'' she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mackie said Copro was currently slaughtering 54 birds a week for the local market. Output is expected to nearly double 100 birds a week when the EU gives a the go ahead to allow imports from Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - To avert disruption of its liberalised trade policy, the Zambian government has said it will, as far as possible, maintain market prices for imported drought relief maize stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture permanent secretary incharge of food security,Austin Sichinga said in a statement Tuesday that in with the liberalised agricultural marketing policies being pursued by government, the non-interventionist policy in price setting of maize and other cereals will be maintained unconditionally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sichinga said that government will, on its part, tender its maize stocks from the national food security reserve at econimic prices to avoid undercutting private sector business interests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian government has forecast substantial price increases for the staple maize grain during the remainder of the current marketing season from the current 9,000 kwacha average. (965 kwacha=one united states dollar).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts said Tuesday that prices could go up by as much as 100 percent due to the anticipated shortage and the approaching rain season when some peasants start sowing some the grain stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to official statistics, this country of nine people consumes some 17.5 million 90 kilogramme bags of maize a year.This seasonLusaka is expected to suffer a of some seven million bags due to partial drought in the maize producing areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Frederick Chiluba's government this month declared 31 districts in five of the country's nine regions as famine disaster areas up to march 1996 and launched a food programme for the over 1 million affected people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It recently launched a donor-supported &quot;Agricultural Sector Investment Programme&quot; (ASIP) which is aimed at, among other objectives, help establish an eleaborate irrigated agriculture system to mitigate future effects of drought on food production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government has since 1992 embraced a liberalised economy as of national economic recovery efforts and has done away with government food and other subsidies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was also decisively influenced by higher growth in the South African economy which grew by 2.3 percent in 1994 compared to 1.1 percent in 1993,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It however noted that in spite the positive ecomomic growth last year, the population had grown by an average of percent, &quot;indicative of decreasing per capita incomes within region&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, food security projections indicated a worsening cereal deficit in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serious shortfalls were expected in Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe due to the late and erratic rains which had adverse effects on crop yields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, South Africa had called on member states to coordinate their programmes to exploit natural resources so as achieve sustainable development in the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures are contained in the Bureau's latest &quot;Stats-flash&quot; monthly publication. It said that the clothing and textiles sector has been also been rocked by high input costs. These have eroded competitiveness in export leading to the liquidation of such major players in the as Cone Textiles. The company laid off at least 6,000 workers in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Weak demand on both the home and export markets and cashflow difficulties continued to be the major bottlenecks affecting industry,&quot; the Bureau said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the mining sector experienced a 37.1 per cent upsurge in output during the first month of 1995, when to the same period the previous year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Zimbabwen government has stopped selling its shares in blue-chip Delta Corporation to foreign investors, market analysts said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A broker said a feature of last week's trading on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange was the refusal by government to any more Delta shares to foreigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current legislation allows foreign investors to own up to 25 percent of the companies whose shares are traded on the exchange.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its most likely that the government has lined up a local buyer or a housing facility for the shares,&quot; the broker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said however that the shares could be sold to the IFC, an arm of the World Bank. &quot;There are a number of rumours around the market with the International Finance Corporation's name popping up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government, as part of its privatisation programme, has so far sold shares worth more than Zimdollars 800 million (USD 94.1 million) out of the 64 million shares it owned in Delta, and its shareholding in the conglomerate was about 11 percent, or 28 million shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign investors had bought most of the stock while local purchases were constrained by a lack of liquidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, trading on the local equity market was brisk last week amid softening of short term money market interest rates from 25.7 percent to 25.25 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Kenya, trading on the the Nairobi stock market hit a record low for 1995 Monday. A total of 76 000 shares changed hands during Monday's session while 106 000 shares were traded Frdiay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts said investors had turned to government treasury bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, trading on the Ghana stock market ended Monday in Accra on an improved volume, pushed by bulk buying of Ghana Limited (unil) shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghana stock Exchange all-share index shot up by 0.19 points to close at 314.02. The market's total capitalisation went up ending at 2,398.00 billion cedis, up from the previous 2,388.81 billion cedis (1209.5 cedis = one US dollar).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 861,100 shares of Unilever and 31,600 shares of CFAO Ghana Limited, which were traded, helped to push the volume to end at 401,740 shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dealers say although the market opened quietly, it is likely to pick up during the week. They said investors to look for Ghana Pioneer Aluminium Factory Limited (GPAF) which started trading Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The excitement has not waned but trading usually opens very quietly,&quot; one dealer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the broader market, Unilever was the only market mover as it went up by three cedis to close at 840. The remaining equities maintained their price levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total shares offered ended at 890,040 against a bid of 642,700 shares.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has rejected as unjustified a proposal by banks to offer a special financing facility for drought-hit commercial farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the proposal, the Central Bank said it will not support a scheme that is both highly inflationary and designed to favour a select few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU), which has been pushing for special interest rates for farmers whose debt zimdollars 3 billion (253 million U.S dollars), expressed at the decision.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank said it was &quot;committed to discouraging support of any action which might have an adverse impact on money and, hence, inflation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank said farmers and banks would have to sit down find other solutions to ease their viability crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The special financing facility was proposed by the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe which had asked the RBZ that banks be allowed to use statutory reserve funds to reschedule the debt of farmers, as well as finance production costs in the 1995/96 season, now less than three months away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same funds, the banks suggested, could also finance projects in the small and medium-scale sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The farmers had asked for rescheduling, at favourable interest rates, of the equivalent of 94 million U.S dollars of an accumulated debt of 353 million U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the farmers said they would require another three billion Zimbabwe dollars to finance production this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its response to the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe President, Sij Biyam, the RBZ said it found it &quot;difficult&quot;' justify assistance to a particular sector of the economy at expense of others who were equally affected by the drought and punitive interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CFU President, Peter Macsporran, responding to the decision by the RBZ, expressed &quot;deep regret&quot;, and told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency (ZIANA) the union was now asking for an urgent meeting with all concerned to discuss the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RBZ said there was need to formulate and implement long-term, measures to deal with the drought, and suggested farmers should establish a drought insurance scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Bank said among the proposals by the bankers, there was no mention of &quot;any significant&quot; contribution by banks towards assisting the farmers, &quot;especially in light of banks' current favourable profitable positions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We suggest that the banks should give consideration to rescheduling the loans and also examine recapitalisation as measures aimed at finding long-term solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RBZ said banks could also finance farmers from proceeds of selling agricultural bonds, which could have a of up to three years and were issued at favourable interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate interview, president of the bankers association, Sij Biyam, confirmed their proposals had been rejected by the RBZ and as of now, each individual farmer be treated on his on merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biyam said farmers had to realise government was against subsidies under its market reform programme, and that the productive sector would have to use their own resources to business.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian says it will include people in villages along its border with Angola in the repatriation of refugees to that country.  Zambia's commissioner for refugees in the Home Affairs Ministry, Lameck Waba, said Wednesday in Lusaka that these refugees would be sent home after 26,000 others at the Meheba and Mayukwayukwa refugee camps in northwestern and western Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioner said that the Angolans were living in border settlements from Mwinilunga to Sinjombela. He did not say how many were there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees says it needs 42.4 billion Zambian Kwacha (about 920 Kwacha = 1 U.S. dollar) to repatriate the estimated 100,000 refugees in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaba said the initial target for repatriation was for 26,000 but government realised there were more people along border settlements, some cutting across the frontiers. Angola signed a peace agreement with the former rebel movement Unita November 1994 ending almost two decades of civil war and paving the way for refugees to return home. However, Zambian newspapers reported Thursday that eight Zambians had been abducted in the north-western disrict of Mwinilunga by guerrillas thought to be fro Unita. The area lies along the Zambia and Angolan border. Citing Zambia's police acting spokesman, Bbonny Kapeso, Wednesday, it said that six of the abducted villagers were women who were fishing Monday in a river near the Angolan border. Two men who tried to trace them were also reported missing, police said. &quot;We believe the eight were abducted by Unita forces,&quot; Kapeso said. &quot;From the police point of view we are taking the necessary steps to establish contact with Angolan authorities.&quot; PANA MM/MK/OSS 31Aug95</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAPE TOWN, South Africa (PANA) - An oil storage and marketing agreement between South Africa and Iran is being delayed for a month until environmental impact studies are complete, officials said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African ministers for the environment and for energy, Dawie De Villiers and Roelof Botha, said in Cape Town that government would reconsider the agreement at its next meeting September 27.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said that the National Iranian Oil Company was fully aware that the agreement was subject to environmental studies. Under the terms of the deal, South Africa would store large quantities of Iranian oil at its Saldanha Bay facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African environmental organisations have expressed concern that increased tankers traffic would result in oil pollution in the ecologically sensitive Saldanha nature conservation area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the General Manager of South Africa's Strategic Fuel Fund, Kobus Van Zyl, is in Teheran to sign the agreement. But A spokesman for the minister of mineral and energy affairs said that the accord would still be subject to the results of the study.</SPAN></P>

(Please check schedule at the end)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film is distributed by the New York-based &quot;International Film Circuit Inc.&quot; which specializes in booking of highly acclaimed foreign films and screening them throughout the country. &quot;Halfaouine&quot; is their first Tunisian film, and they need your support to spread the word to achieve major success for its US premiere.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to their press release, &quot;Halfaouine&quot; breaks new ground in Arab cinema with its flank depiction of sexuality. It tells the story of a 13-year old boy who goes to the women's Turkish baths with his mother in Halfaouine, a working-class neighborhood in Tunis. His dawning puberty stirs up the restlessness of being torn between the man's world which beckons him, and the woman's world which still protects him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film was written and directed by Ferid Boughedir, one of the most well-known film critics in the Arab world, and features actors from Tunisia's acclaimed New Theater. It is a French-Tunisian co-production. Speaking from Paris where he is editing his new feature film, &quot;A Summer in La Goulette&quot;, Boughedir noted that &quot;the film was an enormous commercial success in Tunisia, and although it was shown in neighboring Maghreb nations, Algeria and Morocco, it was banned in all the other Middle Eastern countries, including Lebanon and Jordan. It was even invited to the Damascus Film Festival in Syria, but the authorities would not allow it to be shown.&quot; He continues: &quot;There was nearly a riot at the Cairo Film Festival when &quot;Halfaouine&quot; was shown there, and although they had planned to show the film just one time, they were obliged to show it six times. It was subsequently forbidden for it to be shown in Egyptian movie theatres.&quot; (International Film Circuit press release)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly protests the acts of unauthorized censorship by Your Excellency's government on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) World Television. We also support the BBC's ultimatum that, should unapproved interference continue, it will terminate its television operations in Kenya. CPJ also condemns the recent beating of six journalists by security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC contracted with the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) to re-broadcast its world television news on KBC stations. The contract between the BBC and the KBC stipulates that the government may not interfere in its news broadcasts. Reports indicate that the KBC, on several occasions, has tampered, without authorization, with news items about Kenya that the Minister of Information claims discredit the government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent censored BBC report was its story on the beating of Richard Leakey, a founder of the yet-to-be registered SAFINA political party, and six journalists, including a BBC stringer. On August 18, the BBC issued a statement objecting to the KBC's interference with the broadcast, and threatened to end the television contract. While Your Excellency's administration has yet to respond officially to this statement, Information Minister Johnstone Makau stated earlier this month that the contract would not be renewed unless the tone of BBC reports about Kenya changed. The BBC has been esteemed globally as an exemplary news organization with respect to its objectivity in news reporting and for its far-reaching news coverage. The BBC also remains valuable to Kenya's population as a source of international information and education. A discontinuation of its services would truncate the people's access to this information, to which they have a right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ also condemns the attack against local and foreign press on Thursday, August 10, which was the subject of the aforementioned censored BBC report.  Plainclothes police, youth-wingers from Your Excellency's ruling Kenyan African National Union (KANU) party, and riot police beat six journalists and two other travelers. The journalists were attacked while covering a visit by Richard Leakey, Secretary General of the soon-to-be SAFINA party, to the Nakuru magistrate's court where detained human rights activist Koigi wa Wamwere was due to appear. Leakey was accompanied by human rights lawyer Paul Muite. While Leakey and Muite were assembling in the car park of the court, a mob, which was comprised of individuals whom the journalists recognized as KANU officials and Nakuru police in plain clothes, began to form. The mob launched their attack on Leakey and the SAFINA treasurer with eggs, whips, pick-ax handles, and stones, until they managed to escape the barrage. Both sustained severe injuries as it was difficult for Leakey, who has two artificial legs, to manoeuvre. No on-duty police came to their aid. Shortly thereafter, as the journalists and Muite and his party proceeded to the court, prison guards built a road block, prohibiting their entrance. In the meantime, witnesses report that the mob from below, plus men from two &quot;Government of Kenya&quot; (GK) vehicles with their plate numbers blacked out, also began to create a road block. Realizing the prison guards were not going to offer any protection, Muite and his group fled, breaking through the road block at the bottom of the road. At this point, riot police joined the prison guards, assaulting the journalists with truncheons from the back, and the KANU youth-wingers with whips and rocks from the front. Again, no police arrived to bring order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the melee, the journalists, notably the foreign correspondents, were threatened with death if they reported this incident. Two journalists and one traveler, who suffered fractured and broken bones, were hospitalized, while all sustained severe injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan group of journalists dedicated to the defense of press freedom and the protection of our colleagues worldwide, CPJ condemns the brutal assault. We feel that the involvement of official forces in this attack signals the Kenyan government's thorough disregard for the impartial role of journalists as observers. CPJ also regards this incident as one among many we have documented this year that constitute a disturbing trend of intimidation against the local and foreign press in Your Excellency's country. We urge Your Excellency to order a thorough investigation of this incident and see to it that those responsible are brought to justice. In the matter of the BBC, the Committee respectfully reminds Your Excellency that censorship is a violation of the right of free expression, which is guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, all to which Kenya is a signatory. We hope that Your Excellency will ask the KBC to abide by the terms of its contract with the BBC and cease censoring its reports so as not to deprive Your Excellency's people of their right to information.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 1, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Excellency Captain E. M. Strasser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairperson, National Provisional Ruling Council</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is writing to urge Your Excellency to drop charges against The New Breed journalists. Judgment in their case, which has been before the Sierra Leonian courts for over 21 months, is due August 7. We are enormously concerned that if convicted, the defendants, including notable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists among them such as Dr. Julius Spencer, may be imprisoned for seven to ten years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 13, 1993, The New Breed, a weekly newspaper based in Freetown, published an editorial titled &quot;Redeemers or Villains&quot; that asked Your Excellency's government to respond to an article in the Swedish newspaper Expressen that had accused Sierra Leonian government officials of corruption.  The editorial simply cited the Swedish</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">article, in an attempt to seek clarity on the issues. That same day, a group of New Breed publishers and journalists were arrested. They spent the next two weeks in jail, before being released on bail of 40 million Leones -- the stiffest bail conditions ever imposed on journalists in Sierra Leone, indeed almost in the history of the judiciary. The group were charged with a ten-count criminal indictment of sedition, defamatory libel, and publishing a false report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four accused -- Dr. Julius Spencer, managing editor of the newspaper, and a senior academic at Fourah Bay College; Donald John, acting editor; Alfred Conteh, sales manager and Alusine K. Basiru, general manager of the company that printed the paper, have appeared before the High Court, and the Supreme Court on several occasions. On December 12, 1994, the defendants' bail was revoked, and they were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">returned to prison for 35 days. They were released on January 16 this year.  Since then they have made several more court appearances, the last of which was on July 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ would consider it a terrible miscarriage of justice if these journalists were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. We believe that the only hope is for the criminal charges against them to be dropped. We respectfully urge Your Excellency to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan organization of journalists committed to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ urges Your Excellency to uphold in practice the right of journalists to hold and express opinions and ideas, as guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and by Article 9</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, the last to which, we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Sierra Leone is a signatory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Relief in Sight for Humanitarian Aid: Dwindling Aid Budgets Will Have Grave Consequences</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian aid groups from Europe and the United States are warning that steep reductions in foreign aid to developing countries have become an alarming trend in the West that could undermine global stability and rapidly increase the number of people living in absolute poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warning came as aid groups released a new report, &quot;The Reality of Aid 1995,&quot; which shows that aid from the richer countries to the world's poor suffered a substantial decline in 1993 -- falling from $61 billion to $56 billion, a drop of six percent in real terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taken alone, this worldwide decline is disturbing enough,&quot; said Julia Taft, president of InterAction. &quot;But when you consider that the US Congress is now considering an additional 35 percent reduction in development assistance next year, it is not an exaggeration to say that this trend could have catastrophic consequences for hundreds of millions of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taft noted that severe cuts in aid for international programs such as economic development, environmental protection and disease control might pressure other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industrialized nations to cut aid by similar proportions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this trend continues, by the turn of the century, the flow of development assistance could be little more than a trickle, exacerbating global threats such as rapid population growth, forced migration and environmental degradation,&quot; said Taft, adding that &quot;the AIDS epidemic could worsen and outbreaks of infectious diseases like the Ebola virus will become more likely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Reality of Aid&quot; reports that public opinion polls in countries throughout the industrialized world indicate that most people -- including those in the United States -- support aid to the poorest countries. At the same time, however, government support appears to be declining rapidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of commitments to eliminating poverty at the March 1995 Social Summit in Copenhagen, aid as a percentage of donors' GNP fell from 0.33 percent of GNP in 1992 to 0.30 percent in 1993. The US share is equivalent to 0.15 percent -- or one-half the average of other industrialized nations. The United Nations target is 0.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors also allowed their proportion of government spending to fall from over 2 percent to under 1.8 percent for the first time since 1990. In the United States, the proportion of the federal budget that goes to foreign aid is less than 1 percent. On a per capita basis, the US contribution to development assistance ranks last among all industrialized nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, the US is not the only donor nation considering further aid reductions. Germany is expected to cut aid disbursements by 1.4 percent in 1995; Italian aid for 1995 is 60 percent below its 1992 figure.  Canadian aid will decline by 15 percent in 1995/96 and will fall by 21 percent over the three-year period to 1997/98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the traditionally generous donors, the Netherlands has committed to restore aid to 0.9 percent of its GNP by 1998. Sweden has decided to freeze aid at $1.78 billion until the next election -- guaranteeing a real cut in aid over the next three or four years. Denmark and Norway look set to remain the only donors giving over 1 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) say they fear increasing marginalization for the least developed countries, particularly in Africa, where reduced aid is likely to mean further environmental degradation, increased poverty, disease, conflict and refugee flows. The human cost will be terrible, and the long term financial cost is likely to outweigh the price of an effective strategy to assist Africa now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Reality of Aid 1995&quot; explains that aid spending not only makes a major contribution to human welfare, it is also a highly cost-effective investment in the future. For example, an additional year of school for 1,000 women in Pakistan at a cost of $30,000 is estimated to increase wages by 20 percent and prevent 60 child deaths, 500 births and 3 maternal deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increasing share of aid being allocated to emergencies and the growing allocations of aid to debt reduction are substantially reducing the availability of aid for long-term development, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development cooperation has become increasingly sensitive to the links between poverty reduction and gender equality. As 70 percent of the world's poor people are women or girls, any aid agency seriously attempting to fight poverty has no choice but to address women's needs and potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the attention to gender, however, remains at the level of rhetoric.  Despite near universal recognition that investment in education for women and girls results in better returns than perhaps any other investment, most donors are not yet even reporting their spending on basic education, let alone basic female education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donor countries have recognized the global nature of many threats to human security -- including poverty, drugs, environmental degradation, migration and unemployment -- in policy statements and in aid spending. As the distinctions between foreign, defense, development, trade and environment policy diminish, nations are beginning to acknowledge that sustainable development is a matter of both common security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and good economics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is increasingly clear that development cooperation is in the interests of both rich and poor nations. It is also clear that helping poorer countries is seen as a moral imperative by many people throughout the industrialized world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Reality of Aid&quot; calls for all countries that are reducing aid to reverse the cuts -- and for all donors who have not achieved the UN target to honor commitments by setting firm timetables to reach 0.7 percent. Tony German, one of the principal authors of the report, concludes that: &quot;With the number of people in the world surviving on less than $1 a day still rising -- and clear evidence that aid directed to human need is an excellent investment, donors should build on public commitment to humanitarian action and redouble their efforts -- not to cut aid to some of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">world's neediest people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 4, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Jon Swift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the root of all the current upheaval and litigation facing world rugby union is the insistence by the game's authorities that the game be an amateur sport. This iconoclasm, this sticking to the ideals of a bygone era, is rooted in the breakaway just on 100 years ago, when some of the game's participants, largely in Britain's industrialised areas and almost wholly from the working classes, rebelled against taking the hard knocks and losing pay in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rival code of rugby league comprising 13 men against the 15 in union and largely devoid of the messy scrums and line-outs of the amateur game was born. And the players were paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It meant that working men in towns like Wigan, St Helens, Castleford and Warrington could supplement their week's wages at the coalface or similar through a payment for a Saturday game with the added attraction of win and draw bonuses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by far the biggest attraction was the signing-on fee. Tradition would have it that this amount was used to buy the recipient freehold title to his home. It was a system that was both honoured and accepted as an honest adaptation by the working classes of a game invented and perpetuated by the public school gentry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cynics within rugby league would have it, even today, that it freed the hard men from having to push in the scrums so that their lords and masters could cavort in the backline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germane to the current state of affairs in union, the contracts the players in league signed were binding in that an above-the-board cash agreement between a professional body and a professional player was undertaken. There was nothing hidden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In union, this has never been the case. In the days when the amateur rules meant something, no-one was paid. As society changed, so did this true blue ethic. While still nominally amateurs, the top players in union began to both expect and accept payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They bowed to an iniquitous system known as boot money, a term drawn from the intriguing picture of an official skulking round the changeroom after the game and depositing cash in the players' boots while they busied themselves washing off the mud and soaking the bruises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amounts became too substantial in many cases to fit even the average lock forward's size 13s. Take the R3000 a test the members of the Transvaal side supposedly got for making the Springbok team against Willie-John McBride's 1974 British Lions. Translated through normal inflation into today's monetary terms, this represented a direct payment of some R20 000 a test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly this is far more than the official allowance of around R12 000 a man which the national squad earned for winning the World Cup, a competition which generated hundreds of millions of rands to the Channel Island based World Cup Limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be naive to believe that this country's World Cup heroes earned only the officially allowed expense money. You only have to look at the edict by South African coach, Kitch Christie, shortly before the start of the competition that the squad stop all advertising and promotional activities and get down to playing rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly the faces of Francois Pienaar, Joost van der Westhuizen, Chester Williams and James Small were not used on posters, billboards and in national advertising for nothing...no matter how orgasmic it seemed to be for the actors coming face to face with the Springbok captain over a steak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But any monies earned could not, as the International Rugby Board (IRB) decreed, be earned directly from rugby. They had to be from promotional or other activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sense, the amateur players had remained poorly paid serfs within the game with the potential - admitted large in the case of the stars - to earn outside it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was clearly a system bound for implosion. The catalysts for this came in the form of the intentions of two Australian media magnates to dominate the broadcasting of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rupert Murdoch struck first with a R2-billion offer, spread over the 10 years from the start of the 1996 season, for the rights to all representative rugby played by South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, thus far the only three holders of the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three unions hastily formed SANZAR, the company who signed the deal with Murdoch and who were to run the rugby-playing end of things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal was announced by South African supremo, Louis Luyt, on the eve of the World Cup final and the understanding was that increased benefits would flow through to every playing facet of the game, from test sides to development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow though, the members of SANZAR had forgotten to tie up the top players, who far more than any altruistic motives of promoting the game lower down the scale, were the real targets of the broadcasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a difficult situation. The players were amateurs and in some respects beholden to the unions they represented. But, as they could not be paid directly, any contract had to be of a private - one hesitates to say covert - nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The very rules laid down by the IRB dictated this. As such, the legal enforceability of such contracts has still to be fully tested under law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will surely also be the case when the IRB rules - as it must - that the game is no longer an amateur domain when they meet in Paris later this month. Even if such a ruling is made, can contracts be considered retrospective and legally enforceable? Again, the courts must decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue has been further complicated by Pienaar acting as an agent for Murdoch's arch rival, Kerry Packer, and getting letters of intent signed by the 28 members of the South African World Cup squad to join a yet-to-be- launched global superleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Packer's World Rugby Corporation - which has reputedly put nearly R400-million aside for the launch - also has the signatures of a number of other top players both in this country and worldwide and was the entity which brought last weekend's dramatic urgent interdict to prevent SARFU from putting the Springboks under contractual obligation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This came in the wake of a statement from SARFU chief executive Edward Griffiths last Friday that an agreement had been reached between the South African body and the players and that &quot;the storm has passed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One suspects that this was a highly premature appraisal by Griffiths. This week's Supreme Court hearing on the issue in Cape Town and the almost inevitable string of litigation which will follow the finding whatever it is prove that Griffiths and SARFU will have to keep a close eye on the barometer for a while yet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Karen Harverson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa urgently needs trade and investment to drive its development which is slower now than it was 30 years ago, says one of Southern Africa's leading economists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Hawkins, professor of Business Studies at the University of Zimbabwe, was speaking at a Standard Chartered conference held last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that per capita incomes in Africa were lower now than they were in the 1960s, as populations grew faster than economies grew, Hawkins explained that unlike the South East Asian countries, whose rapid economic development was driven by trade and investment, Africa's lack of development is driven by aid and debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the 1960's Thailand's gross domestic product (GDP) was lower per head than Ghana's -- today, it is five times greater,&quot; said Hawkins.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a radical change in certain African countries' economic policies was necessary to attract investment by multinationals which he believed would be crucial in leading the development of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many African governments have shown commitment to the liberalisation of trade and investment policy but have found it difficult to implement these changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem facing many African countries is that their economies are 80 percent commodity-based and highly vulnerable to adverse international trends and climatic conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fortunately, the protracted downturn in commodity prices in 1992 and 1993 appears to have ended and this bodes well for potential investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another plus in Africa's favour was that the return on investment in Africa was greater for multinationals than in any other country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Of course, the risks are also much higher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hawkins said that Africa's best chance for attracting investment was in traditional industries or in the area of privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Excluding privatisation, most investors are attracted to ventures in oil, gas and mining, especially in West Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's difficulties are compounded by tiny markets which hold little attraction for the modern multinational companies, said Hawkins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only South Africa and Nigeria have market sizes topping the $10-billion mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa is the only 'star' on the continent in terms of market size, growth rate and market attractiveness. It's the only market investors view as essential to enter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said investors measured the market attractiveness of a country in terms of resource endowment, political stability, policy environment, infrastructure and institutional capacity, foreign debt-burden and export concentration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of these, policy environment is the most important. Resource endowment is a key factor in attracting investment but not essential as proven by the successful economies of the South East Asian countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said countries such as Mauritius, Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland were seen as &quot;limited scope&quot; countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have good policies and political stability but their markets were just too small to attract investment interest beyond exploitation of raw materials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its market size, Nigeria, along with Cote d'Ivoire, Angola, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Cameroon and Tanzania, was ranked as a &quot;problem child&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These countries have good growth environments when markets improve but the scope is limited by the moderate market size. Investors need to pick the winners and establish joint ventures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He relegated Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Toga, Somalia, Rwanda and others to the ranks of &quot;dog&quot; countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are viewed as no-go countries which will take a long time to develop market attractiveness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned investors to adopt a &quot;watch and wait&quot; attitude to these African countries apart from some exports and marketing outlet opportunities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Karen Harverson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trademark dispute between Chicken Licken owner George Sombonos and US hamburger chain McDonald's will be heard in the Pretoria Supreme Court this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case consists of two applications; one of which will be tried under South Africa's old Trademark Act and the other under the new Act passed in May 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first application -- to expunge McDonald's trademark from the registrar for non-use -- is being brought by Joburgers Drive-In Restaurant, owned by Sombonos, and Dax Prop, a franchisee of Sombonos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be tried under the old Trademark Act as legal action was taken before the new Trademark Act was passed in May 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to South African law, a third party can apply to the registrar to remove a trademark if non-use of the trademark for a period of five years can be proven. A trademark can only be registered if there is intent to make use of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McDonald's first registered its trademark in 1968, re- registered in 1974, again in 1980, once again in 1985 and finally in 1993 shortly after we applied for its expungement from the register,&quot; says Sombonos attorney Sean Ryan of Ryans Attorneys and Trade Mark Agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Twenty-seven years have passed and McDonald's still has not made use of it -- therefore, we are entitled by law to apply for its expungement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McDonald's will contest the expungement applications brought under Section 36 of the old Act which justifies non-use if there are &quot;special circumstances in the trade&quot;. In papers before the court, it contends that sanctions and sanctions legislation constituted such &quot;special circumstances&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McDonald's was seriously considering investing in South Africa as far back as 1979 in the normal course of its international expansion. However, the threat of sanctions and later, sanctions legislation, precluded such an arrangement. The critical five-year period of non-use fell right in the middle of the sanctions period,&quot; says Spoor &amp; Fisher partner Gavin Morley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ryan argues that the Anti-Apartheid Act had two provisions which enabled US companies to operate in South Africa during the sanctions period -- at arm's length, through licensing agreements, or through handing over the reins to a black-owned or -controlled company or person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second application, brought by McDonald's, will be tried under the new Act which has a provision under section 35 which affords protection to foreign trademarks which are &quot;well known&quot; in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the trademark is not yet in use, the evidence in the case, including surveys, prove that a substantial portion of the South African population recognises the name,&quot; says Morley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so, says Ryan. He claims that the McDonald's survey only represents the opinions of a mere 200 whites from households with incomes in excess of R6 000, while a survey conducted on behalf of his client indicates most South Africans have no recognition of the trademark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further slates the passing of the new Trademark Act which he views as &quot;an appalling piece of legislation&quot; which gives more rights to foreigners than South Africans would be afforded in those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US legislation states if a trademark isn't used in two years of registration, it is presumed abandoned and struck from the register unless the owner can prove he didn't abandon the mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, a trademark, if renewed every 10 years, remains registered indefinitely unless a third party applies for expungement after non-use of five years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Karen Harverson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multinational hamburger chain McDonald's is on track to open its first two restaurants in South Africa despite the fact that the court case over the rights to its trademark has not yet been resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African George Sombonos, owner of franchise chain Chicken Licken, is seeking the right to expunge McDonald's trademark from the South African register on the basis of &quot;non-use&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in the process of establishing a full country office in South Africa and plan to have a mix of operations in this country,&quot; says Carter Drew, newly appointed managing director and president of McDonald's South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is adamant that McDonald's had nothing to do with pressure exerted on South Africa by the United States to intervene in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are operating in good faith and expect to open in South Africa. We have confidence in South Africa's due process system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first two outlets will be based in Johannesburg and Cape Town and will be franchised with individual franchisees owning and operating their own businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three South African potential licensees are already undergoing training in New Zealand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drew says the company expects operations to be up and running by December this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicates that a substantial marketing drive will be undertaken prior to the opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is McDonald's policy to use local suppliers wherever feasible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Suppliers have been identified and will be appointed within the next two to three months,&quot; says Drew, adding that most of the ingredients will be sourced locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restaurants typically employ 60 to 80 people. &quot;It will be some time before the company becomes a large- scale employer in South Africa,&quot; adds Drew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company is the leading food service retailer in the global consumer market place, with more than 15 700 restaurants worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 80 percent of its businesses are locally owned and operated by independent entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa will be the 84th country in which McDonald's opens its doors, and the third African country after Morocco and Egypt. Morocco has two outlets while Egypt has four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drew says that the company will own or lease the property in South Africa on which the restaurants will be sited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Karen Harverson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portnet may enter into a joint venture with the People's Republic of the Congo to manage and operate the country's major port, Pointe Noire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portnet chief executive Neil Oosthuizen says in-depth discussions have been held with the Congolese ambassador and minister of transport who have expressed serious interest in the South African port authority taking joint control and management of the port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the next two weeks, a Portnet delegation will fly to the Congo to do an on-site assessment of the port's infrastructure and, thereafter, assess the feasibility of the venture,&quot; Oosthuizen says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main requirements of a port are that the harbour has adequate depth and safe waters, and basic infrastructure such as breakwaters and quay wall structures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although uncertain of the exact size and port infrastructure at Pointe Noire, Oosthuizen believes it is a general, all-purpose port similar to Port Elizabeth, handling general cargo, containers and a small amount of bulk commodities using normal crane operation but without sophisticated belt-operation facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe some terminals are operating but the Congolese government is keen to improve the situation and has shown preference for South Africa to assist, despite interest shown by other foreign countries,&quot; says Oosthuizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financing details would be discussed within two weeks and would depend on the structure of the joint venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other options might include contracting the terminal facilities out to private operators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oosthuizen says a major factor influencing Portnet to consider the venture has been the recent relocation of South African farmers to the Congo to build up the agriculture industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is great potential for the production of a large amount of agricultural produce for export as well as increased trade between South Africa and the Congo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Transnet's annual financial results held this week, managing director Dr Anton Moolman said for the first time since its inception five years ago,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet had made a sufficient profit to make provision for the R1,9-billion contribution to its pension fund and still reflect a net profit of R118-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public company inherited a deficit of R17,2-billion in the pension fund when it was first commercialised and has managed to get it down to R4,2-billion this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Improved turnover was reported by transport businesses Spoornet, Petronet, Autonet, South African Airways (SAA) and Portnet, while goods distributor PX recorded a net loss of R297-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PX has now decided to modernise and unbundle into focused businesses to improve its operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll be moving away from rail transportation into road,&quot; said chief executive Wicus Pretorius.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that plans were afoot to modernise depots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We plan to restructure the business and concentrate on commercial and industrial parcels, courier services and express services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portnet's net profit rose 45 percent on last year's profit to R1,1-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A record high of 154,9-million tons of cargo was handled by the port authority despite the labour unrest which had lead to congestion in March and April this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bulk cargo, which accounts for the major portion of its business, rose almost seven percent to a new record of 96,7-million tons, which equals 74 percent of the total cargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New records were set in the export of iron ore through Saldanha Bay of 20,9-million tons and wood chips through Richards Bay of 5,3-million tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal exports through the Port of Richards Bay amounted to 53,7-million tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Container traffic showed the greatest increase with the number of containers handled increasing by 20 percent to a record 1,20-million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The container business is very profitable, so the increased traffic in containers has contributed greatly to our overall performance,&quot; said Oosthuizen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mail &amp; Guardian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Matthew Krouse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athol Fugard's island, today, is not the isolated penal colony he once dramatised with fellow actors John Kani and Winston Ntshona. His present refuge is a territory of optimism, where he directs hopeful youngsters who symbolise freedoms gained. It's a happy valley of song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By working with the young, Fugard gets what he calls &quot;my monkey-gland injections&quot;. His new play, Valley Song, is no exception, for it is one of many recent instances in which he has chosen to work with someone at least 30 years younger than himself. Here, his co-worker is Esmerelda Bihl, and Fugard's face lights up at the mention of her name.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are both personal and political reasons why Fugard now concentrates his energies on the youth: &quot;At this point in time, as South Africans, we are the happy, or unhappy, participants in one of the most extraordinary political adventures of the 20th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks as if it's going to be an adventure with a happy ending. We're well into our second year down the line, and we haven't fallen apart. A lot of things are still wrong, but we knew that. We knew what was going to be on the debit side after 18 months, and there are no surprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're inclined to forget sometimes is how much we have achieved, how much is holding together. That sense of drama, that incredible adventure, I want to be a part of. And the only way that somebody in my age group -- 63 years old, his entire writing career defined by the apartheid years -- can club into it is by connecting with the kind of young people I've been able to touch, feel, understand and respond to. They're the reality of our new nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Left to my own devices, I would turn into something of a fossil. I'm embedded deep in the mud strata of those apartheid years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Valley Song, Fugard plays two old men: Abraam, a poor, coloured veteran of World War II, who is the grandfather of Bihl's Veronica; and an author who enters their lives. Like The Road to Mecca, the play is set in Nieu Bethesda, Fugard's adopted home. It was here that he began to combine the actual events and characters that would constitute a fictitious play. But the process was difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I structured a story to deal with these two characters, bringing them together as grandfather and granddaughter. I have in my bottom drawer, back in Port Elizabeth, three orthodox versions of Valley Song as a straight play, but it just wasn't working for me. I just couldn't get it up. Sorry about the language, but I just couldn't get hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I realised that somehow I had to match the adventure of writing about this young woman. I had to match it with the same kind of adventure, on my side, in terms of my craft. I had to throw my rules away; I had to tear the stage open to a certain extent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's nothing radical about the play -- it gives you a story line and it follows it. But it does so in a way that I've never used before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's amusing that Fugard refers to playwriting in sexual terms. And he extends the metaphor: &quot;There is a sexual imagery that runs through the play, and it is in relation to the land. It's a disguised subtext. There is this old coloured with a handful of pumpkin seeds, wanting to put that seed into the soil. In a sense, I am that old man, except that my handful is a handful of words, my vegetable lands are a handful of paper. It's exactly the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest handful of paper, Fugard offers a direction for young people to follow, in times of personal transition. A message is embedded in the actions of Veronica, whose ambition is to go to the city and become a star.  But is hers an example youths should follow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like to believe that Veronica is a role model, finding, firstly, faith in herself. On the basis of that faith in herself, and in the pursuit of a dream for herself, she finds the courage to step into an uncertain future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not the specifics of Veronica's dream and her ambition that one lauds. I mustn't judge that. It's her spirit. If somebody wants to be a television star and a singer, and make lots of money, then good luck to them.  It's not the specifics of her vision, but the fact that she has a vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She finds faith in herself in desperate circumstances. She follows through against powerful emotional opposition from the old man. She's up against poverty, isolation and a lack of support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is ironic that Fugard will not question the motives of a character he has created himself. This is perhaps a result of his own mysterious journey, which has led him to settle in Nieu Bethesda. He reflects on this, in the context of his play: &quot;Growing up in the coloured location in Nieu Bethesda is very much harder than growing up in the back streets of Port Elizabeth. But from those back streets of Port Elizabeth, I went on a journey which took me to Broadway and West End. And where have I ended up? In Nieu Bethesda!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fugard's home is now in that desolate valley. He writes of Nieu Bethesda in his memoir, Cousins, that &quot;as the crow flies it is about 50 miles from where I was born&quot;. In this way he has come full circle, yet he is surprisingly unjaded. He retains the energy of a fresh- faced child who, like his character Veronica, is driven by a vision and an obliging resilience. Being world famous doesn't seem to have touched him at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valley Song runs at the Market Theatre from August 15 to September 16. It then travels to the Midlands Drama Festival in Hilton and to Port Elizabeth.  After its South African run, it will transfer to the McCarter Theatre in Princeton and then New York's Manhattan Theatre Club. It is also to be produced at the Royal Court in London</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Phillippa Garson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charges of plagiarism are being leveled against renowned South African writer and educationist Mbulelo Mzamane. The credibility of renowned South African writer and educationist Mbulelo Mzamane has been called into question, with evidence surfacing that he plagiarised extracts of the work of another famous writer and journalist, Joseph Lelyveld, now editor of the New York Times. Mzamane, who is vice-chancellor of Fort Hare University, chair of the Book Development Council of South Africa and chair of the board of the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism, wrote a short story, Entry into Soweto, in a collection entitled Colours of a New Day, published in 1990. The book was brought out to raise funds for the ANC's cultural work. The short story directly reproduces paragraphs of Lelyveld's Pulitzer Prize-winning work Move Your Shadow (1985), inspired by his experiences as a foreign correspondent here in the 1980s. The particular piece from which Mzamane drew describes an incident where he, Lelyveld, knocked down a pedestrian. Here and there, Mzamane has made slight changes to give the work a more South African flavour. Where Lelyveld writes &quot;succession of drab farming towns&quot;, Mzamane writes &quot;succession of drab dorpies (as they are called here)&quot;. Other phrases and descriptive passages are reproduced virtually word for word throughout Mzamane's five-page story. The short-story compilation, which includes previously unpublished works of a string of renowned authors, including Nadine Gordimer, Joyce Carol Oates and Ben Okri, was originally published by Lawrence and Wishart in the United Kingdom in 1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was published here by Ravan and in the United States by Pantheon Books. Ironically, Pantheon Books and the publishers of Move Your Shadow, Times Books, are both divisions of the same US publishing corporation, Random House. It was at Random House that the duplication was spotted. In a letter, dated July 19 1991, to Stephen Hayward and Sarah Lefanu, the editors of the anthology in which Mzamane's story appears, the senior counsel for Random House Inc, Elise Solomon, writes: &quot;I am writing on behalf of Pantheon Books, a division of Random House Inc, to notify you of an extremely serious plagiarism and copyright infringement charge which Pantheon has just learned of concerning the story entitled Entry into Soweto in the above-referenced book. Large portions of the story ... appear to be taken verbatim from pages 11 through 13 of a book by Joseph Lelyveld entitled Move Your Shadow ... &quot;Mr Lelyveld, who is managing editor of the New York Times, is quite upset, and we of course are shocked at the similarities.&quot; Solomon then asks the editors to extract an explanation from Mzamane. In a lengthy four-page reply written five days later, in possession of the Mail &amp; Guardian, Mzamane defends his actions. He admits that the use of Lelyveld's work comprises 50 percent of his short story, but claims the duplication was not &quot;designed to pass unnoticed ... The experimental technique may be controversial in ways I did not anticipate, but deception was never my contemplated end in view.&quot; He describes the way he worked with Lelyveld's material as &quot;experimentation, adaption and transformation -- an open exercise that hardly qualifies to be described as dishonest&quot;. Mzamane says in the letter he was not motivated by profit to write the work, since no payment was expected. He claims the original short story on his computer had a dedication to Lelyveld. He defends omitting any acknowledgment, saying that authors prefer to discover for themselves influences or literary references. &quot;It is an oversight I now sorely regret.  It is my error of judgment, and it is not the fault of my editors, that some such form of acknowledgment as 'dedication' is missing,&quot; writes Mzamane. He cites the works of many classical philosophers, playwrights and poets to justify &quot;a very ancient practice, not of copyright infringement and plagiarism, but of adaptation, sometimes leading to transformation and enrichment ... My purpose, then, was to transform a remarkable anecdote into modern short-story form.&quot; Mzamane says in his reply that he drew on other authors for his story, including Alex La Guma, whose character Shilling Murile, in his work Time of the Butcherbird, is the man knocked down by the car, in Mzamane's story. Once the duplication was picked up, no further copies were printed by the publishers. Other publishing houses expressing interest in the collection were turned away because of the &quot;major copyright problem&quot;, said Hayward, co-editor of Colours of a New Day, from his London office. &quot;Had we, the editors and the publishers, been aware of the origins of the work, it would never have been published. We took it for granted that the works from the three dozen writers around the world were their original work.  It would have been insulting to say to some of the finest writers in the English-speaking world: 'This is your original work, isn't it?'&quot; In Hayward's view, Lelyveld &quot;behaved incredibly honourably throughout. He could have made life so painful it doesn't bear thinking about. But he could see what the book's overall purpose was, the spirit behind it. He didn't want to cause trouble.&quot; Mzamane, who is a professor, did his PhD at Sheffield University in the UK and lectured at various universities in the US before returning to South Africa. He wrote an anthology of short stories and a novel before his Entry into Soweto: Mzala (Ravan, 1976) and The Children of Soweto (Ravan, 1982). Mzamane yesterday declined to comment further. # Joseph Lelyveld writes In a driving rain, at night, he came through the windshield. For an interminable moment I thought I had killed him. We were at the end of a 400-mile drive from Durban that had started at the coast, where the Indian Ocean breaking on rocks sent spume into a gray sky; then taken us through the green hills of Natal, mostly shrouded in mist, up to the highveld, through a succession of drab farming towns, set off by their churches, their gas stations, and their separate black 'locations', until abruptly the openness, the sadness, the sense of the land were lost in the thickening traffic of Johannesburg and we were driving past the movie palaces on Commissioner Street, where overdressed Saturday night crowds came tripping out of the rain. # Mzamane's side of the story In a driving rain, at night, he came through the windshield. For an interminable moment I thought I had killed him. We were at the end of a 640-kilometre drive from Durban that had started at the coast, where the Indian Ocean breaking on rocks sent spumes into a grey sky, and then had taken us along winding paths through the green hills of Natal, mostly shrouded in mist, up to the highveld in the Transvaal, through a succession of drab dorpies (as they are called here), farming towns, set off by their churches with spiraling towers and a cock perched on top, their gas stations, and their separate black locations, until abruptly the openness, the sadness, the sense of the land were lost in the thickening traffic of Johannesburg and we were driving past the cinema houses on Commissioner Street, where overdressed Saturday night crowds of whites came tripping out of the rain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian, the most &quot;wired&quot; newspaper in Africa, has launched a new media division to strengthen its electronic publishing programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new division, eM&amp;G, will be focused on expanding the M&amp;G's Internet profile, developing specialised electronic services to harness the publishing opportunities presented by the information superhighway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G has committed two of its most senior staffers to this division -- director and former co-editor Irwin Manoim and special projects director Bruce Cohen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manoim, a respected Pringle Award winner and pioneer of desktop publishing in South Africa, is also editor of the M&amp;G's acclaimed computer supplement PC Review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen is one of South Africa's leading Internet publishing experts, who brought the M&amp;G on-line in March 1994 -- making it the first newspaper in Africa on the Internet. He founded MisaNet, an Internet news service and press freedom network linking together the independent media in the sub-continent under the auspices of the Windhoek-based Media Institute of Southern Africa. He has presented papers on Internet publishing at several conferences locally and internationally. He writes the Mail's weekly Internet column Web Feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G's World Wide Web on the Internet site was recently selected as among the top five percent of all Internet web sites by Point Surveys in the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G's Internet services currently include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An electronic version of the paper delivered every Friday to Internet subscribers worldwide;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Mail &amp; Guardian Internet archive -- a fully searchable database of all stories published since July 1994;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* PC Review Online, a value-added World Wide Web version of the M&amp;G's popular PC Review supplement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An online version of the M&amp;G weekly entertainment guide;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The M&amp;G Forum, a lively Internet discussion forum on topical South African issues, enhanced this week by the addition of a number of new WWW forums on computing, eco-tourism and marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are planning substantial enhancements to existing services as well as a wide range of new services,&quot; says Cohen. &quot;The core strength of the Mail &amp; Guardian -- its editorial credibility and quality --- will be the foundation of our electronic services. We aim to deliver to the rapidly increasing local -- and international -- Internet community world-class interactive electronic products and services of real value.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key feature of the M&amp;G's Internet service will be its interactivity with the &quot;hard-copy&quot; version of the paper. &quot;We'll be constantly enhancing the editorial coverage of the paper with additional information, including original source material, on our Internet site,&quot; says Cohen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 18, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Jon Swift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a measure of the determination, talent and sheer guts of the man that Ernie Els would come back from the bitter disappointment of the US PGA the way he has. To understand that, it is worth recalling one of the oldest maxims of professional golf: you can win the Masters one week and miss the cut the next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this aspect of golf which makes it such an intriguing game. The rough always lies right alongside the fairway, the bunkers are always there to turn a shot rifling in at the flag into a scramble to up-and- down for par.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even a seemingly perfect putt can become a wayward miss. Nothing more amply illustrated this aspect of the game than the heart-rending one that got away from Els on the 16th at Riviera. Battling to hold his game together off the tee, Els had fought back at eventual winner Steve Elkington and rotund Scot Colin Montgomerie throughout the frustrating round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is history now that the putt did a complete circuit of the lip of the hole and then agonisingly stayed out. Had it dropped, Els would have been right back in the hunt, could have relaxed a little over the last few holes and perhaps added a second major to his 1994 US Open triumph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This never happened. Golf, to quote the old saw, is a game won by inches.  This marginality is the ethos, the heart of the sporting pastime foisted on the world by the Scots. It also has the effect of turning the top players into either philosophers or basket cases. And in both instances, the verbal outpourings on a round -- good, bad or indifferent -- tend to be of the &quot;I'll just play one shot at a time&quot; variety. And with yet another round, yet another tournament looming, there is truly nothing different to say -- and that's how it is with the details of Els' failure to hold onto that three-shot lead going into the final round of the PGA at Riviera last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This merely underlines the impartiality of the game to individuals and echoes the fate which has befallen many of the game's leading exponents.  World No 1 Greg Norman is just one, and on more than one occasion Nick Price, the man he reclaimed top spot on the world rankings from, is another. Both these men have taken it on the jaw and come roaring back. For in the analysis, there is always another shot, always another round and generally another tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there will be weeks when even the world No 1 will miss the halfway cut and not make a cheque. In this the game differs widely from some of the other contenders in the big-money sport stakes. In tennis, first round losers still earn enough to keep a middling-sized squatter camp in bread and beans for a month. In baseball, basketball and the other sports which generate both individual megabucks and superstardom, the cheque comes in; win, lose or draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Golf is not like that. Miss the top 60 after 36 holes and it's pack your bags, pay your caddy and move on to the practice tee at the next tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, it is apposite to return to Els, who admittedly picked up a substantial amount for third place at Riviera, but nevertheless had to pack his bags and his disappointment and move on to the next tournament as an also-ran. So, the opening round 69 the South African recorded to lie two shots back in second behind Davis Love III in the Ernst Championship at Overlake Golf and Country Club, was a round of special merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Els has shown that he has both the talent and the temperament to step beyond the pitfalls of the week behind him. In this ability lies the seeds of golfing greatness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 18, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Ahitisham Manerjee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam Bacher and Shaun Pollock have famous names to live up to but they are playing their own way in Sri Lanka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a popular myth amongst Westerners that Sri Lankans, and Asians in general for that matter, are all fanatical about cricket. For their part, Sri Lankans have a similar misconception about Yorkshiremen and anyone called Geoffrey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is some truth in both generalisations but the South African Under-24 cricket team in Sri Lanka has been surprised to find the back pages of local newspapers dominated as much by rugby as by cricket. They arrived with only two weeks of the domestic season remaining and enthusiasm for the imminent cup final is tangible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if there is one thing that excites a Sri Lankan cricket fan more than anything else, it is a famous name. The country is less than halfway through its second decade as a Test -playing nation and there are a mere 60 Tests for the statisticians and romantics to reminisce over. In spite of this, or perhaps because of it, the depth of knowledge and interest in the history of the game is extraordinary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And nothing tickles the cricketing palate quite like a famous name. Coach Bob Woolmer was subjected to the non-stop patter of a middle-aged &quot;tuk-tuk&quot; driver who remembered his only previous visit to the island with the MCC touring side of 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Omigod!&quot; he shrieked, narrowly avoiding a lorry full of sheep. &quot;You are Bob Woolmer! I know you! Yes! You play for England ... why you now coach South Africa!?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well ...&quot; said Woolmer. It was the first and last word Bob was able to fit in. The tuk-tuk driver recounted the team of 1976 which was captained by Tony Greig and included three future England captains in Keith Fletcher, Mike Brearley and Bob Willis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see you score 65 in SSC stadium ...&quot; continued the grinning driver.  Woolmer shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Did I?&quot; he muttered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinarily there would have been a few other famous names in a squad of young hopefuls still hoping to build an international career. But this South African squad is far from ordinary. Several other individuals were delighted to see Woolmer again but, as good a player as he was, there are two young men that Sri Lankans were even keener to meet: Shaun Pollock and Adam Bacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It puts into perspective the performances of my father and uncle,&quot; says Shaun. &quot;The fact that they are so well known, even revered, all over the world. It makes me proud ... of course it does.&quot; But isn't it a burden as well, with so much to live up to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Err, not really (yes). I don't really think about it (much),&quot; says Pollock junior. And has father Peter been a great help in his burgeoning fast bowling career? &quot;I've pretty much got to where I am now by myself,&quot; he says, &quot;but I don't mean to say he hasn't helped me. He stayed away from school matches and that sort of thing. I suppose that might have been a bit of a sacrifice on his part. All I know is that I haven't been put into teams because of my name. I went through all the ranks on merit ... Natal junior schools, senior schools, SA schools, Natal and now the Under-24's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One day someone in the Kingsmead crowd shouted to me: 'Hey Pollock, why the hell are you in the team ... because of your old man?' I looked back at this guy and just said, Yeah, of course it is. That's dead right'&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graeme Pollock, perhaps, was even greater than Peter. Certainly his legend is greater in Sri Lanka. But he, too, has had little influence on Shaun's career. If anyone was to benefit from the mighty left-hander's experience it would be his own two sons, Anthony and Andrew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were both amazing players, obviously,&quot; says Shaun. &quot;If I turn out like either of them it'll be a great bonus. All I know is that when I get picked for the senior South African team it won't be because my dad is convenor of selectors! It'll be because I have done enough to deserve my place, like it always has been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam Bacher is altogether a different case. His progress has been too rapid to even notice the effect of being a Bacher. Whatever the rest of the world might have to say, Sri Lankans regard Adam's uncle Ali as the greatest cricket administrator of modern times. With his record as a player and Springbok captain thrown in, Adam, too, has quite a reputation to live up to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have I?&quot; he asks. &quot;I actually played tennis and squash more than cricket when I was younger. In squash I reached number three in South Africa at Under-12 level. But ... maybe it's true when they say that cricket is in your blood. My father Issy was always a squash player but I chose cricket. Ali always helped me, but not technically, mentally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam is an intense character, and always will be. With his high forehead and furrowed brow he more closely resembles an accountant with 24 hours to prepare ICI's year-end financial report, but at least he is quick to admit the potential pitfalls of such a temperament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This time last year I was approaching despair. I had retreated into my shell and couldn't communicate with anyone. I was desperate to succeed, and although I never doubted that I would make it, I hadn't envisaged what the road to success would be like. I began to wonder whether I should set my sights a bit lower. But I learned to relax. Ali helped me, just telling me to enjoy cricket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bacher family really is close and, unlike the Pollocks, one could imagine them spending a communal Christmas -- except it would be Rosh Hashana. And the relationship between uncle and nephew is correspondingly trickier -- in the nicest possible way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Adam handles it much better than I do,&quot; laughs Bacher senior. &quot;He always tells me to relax and forget about it.&quot; But Adam provides a closer insight into the dilemma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ali came to our pre-tour camp in Durban to wish us well. He is very conscious of keeping everything as impartial as possible, so we kept a conscious distance between ourselves. It was pretty amusing, actually, but he called me the next day to say 'Have a good trip' and to remind me to relax and enjoy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam did not disappoint the curious locals when he opened the innings with a fierce knock of 86 from 109 balls in the Under-24's tour-opener against the President's XI in Colombo. And Woolmer has little doubt that Pollock is the fastest bowler in the squad and agrees that, with continued development, he could follow in his father's footsteps as a South African opening bowler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulties of following in famous family footsteps have been well documented. There are as many failures as successes. But Shaun and Adam make light of it. Whether comments come from the man in the crowd, the tuk-tuk driver or from the opposition, they seem more than able to cope. Already they are their own men. Success or failure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Reg Rumney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blame it on the weather and industrial relations on the mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary figures show economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP) -- the total value of all goods and services, adjusted for seasonal factors -- slowed to an annualised and real or adjusted-for-inflation 0,8 percent in the second quarter of this year. This follows unspectacular growth of 1,4 percent in the first quarter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Statistical Service ascribes the drop mainly to the plunge in agricultural production, which fell almost 42 percent, annualised, after falling 18 percent in the first quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If agriculture is excluded, the economy grew 3,1 percent in the second quarter, a full percentage point higher than the first-quarter figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encouragingly, one of the sectors which contributed to that higher growth was manufacturing, with a growth rate of seven percent. With the exception of mining, other sectors also showed growth. Mining's contribution to non-farm GDP dropped 11 percent, after a decrease of 10,1 percent in the first quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standard Bank economists, in the latest Economic Review, lay the blame for mining's poor showing on &quot;liberation expectations&quot; among the workforce, with gold production worst affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say the fall in gold production can be traced back to a slowdown in the output of underground operations, which account for 93 percent of all gold produced by South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the many public holidays in the first half are a part of the cause, organised labour can be expected to deny vigorously that the problems of the mines are the workers' fault. Whatever the reason, Standard reckons reduced gold production in 1995 is expected to trim potential economic growth by half a percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same vein, Standard has predicted that lower agricultural output could knock at least 0,5 percent off economic growth this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the underlying strong momentum of the economy is welcome news, it means that further interest-rate hikes cannot be ruled out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 18, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Eddie Koch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A plan to mine for diamonds along the Limpopo River is causing the biggest environment controversy since St Lucia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the banks of the Limpopo River between Messina and the Kruger National Park there lies a stretch of South Africa's last wilderness -- baobab thickets, tropical flood plains, riverine forests, a diversity of bird life, and free-ranging herds of buffalo and elephants - - that is set to become the focus of the country's biggest environmental controversy since the St Lucia debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military, a multinational diamond mining corporation, a coalition of green organisations and at least three dispossessed rural communities (each with different interests) are the main contenders in a complex struggle that is looming over how this 80km- long Madimbo Corridor, and its rich mix of natural resources, will be used now that it is no longer needed as a cordon sanitaire against total onslaught from the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present the South African National Defence Force manages the corridor, which straddles the border with Zimbabwe, as a conservation area and buffer zone against illegal immigrants who flood over the frontier. Military authorities have accepted that Venda and Tsonga communities removed from the area in the 1960s and 1980s have legitimate restitution claims -- but will rather pay these people compensation and continue to use the area as a training ground for reconnaissance commandos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last year the army lifted a ban on prospecting for valuable minerals in the corridor and the Madimbo Diamond Corporation (called the Duo Corporation in some reports) -- a 50-50 venture between local businessmen and an Australian mining company called Moonstone -- was given a permit in May this year to look for diamonds that may have been washed down the Limpopo from volcanic pipes located further upstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This news has created an uproar among green groups with the National Parks Board and the Wildlife Society claiming that one of the subcontinent's last areas of true wilderness is about to be strip-mined and destroyed. &quot;If mining goes ahead it will most likely blow any future ecotourism ventures off the map, not to mention the irreversible ecological and archaeological impact,&quot; says a statement issued by the Wildlife Society. The National Parks Board has lodged an objection to the prospecting permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Richard Bluett, a director of the Madimbo Mining Corporation, says his company will ensure that prospecting and mining operations will follow strict environmental guidelines. &quot;Most of the sites where we believe the diamonds are deposited are covered by mopani scrub which we will easily be able to restore. We won't take out baobab forests nor will we mine where there is riverine forest or other sensitive ecological systems,&quot; he told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers at the Mineral and Energy Policy Centre, an independent NGO that is helping the African National Congress develop a mines and mineral policy, say it is possible for diamond mining to exist alongside conservation and tourism. &quot;Alluvial diamond mining does not have heavy ecological impacts and can be tightly controlled,&quot; says John Bristow, a geologist who did doctoral research on mineral deposits of the Northern Transvaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The process does not require chemicals and is remarkably clean although it uses a lot of water. In a country that needs to promote development for 40 million people, it is not helpful to promote an emotional rejection of mining in favour of conservation. The two can exist in the Madimbo area if the matter is handled properly.&quot; He adds that Moonstone would be guided by strict environmental guidelines that govern Australian mining companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caught between the military, the environmental groups and the industrialists -- lobbies made up mainly of wealthy middle class members -- are groups with less opportunity to make their voices heard: the rural people who were forcibly removed from Madimbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend Chief Mutale told a group of journalists who visited the village with the Wildlife Society that he is opposed to mining on his tribe's traditional land, mainly because the Madimbo Corporation had failed to consult him before applying for its permit. But while he was addressing an official press conference, other residents in the village said they favoured mining and pointed out that the nearby Tshikondeni Coal Mine, located on the Kruger Park border near their village, was a major engine for economic growth in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further to the east are the Makuleke people who resided in the northern Pafuri district of the Kruger Park and a strip in the east of the Madimbo Corridor called Mabiligwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They built villages along the river valleys of the area -- living off the fish, animals, wild fruits, mlala palms that could be used to make a nutritious wine, and rich agricultural soils on the floodplains -- until they were forcibly moved in 1969 so that the Kruger Park could be extended to the banks of the Limpopo River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You should tell these people who like wildlife that they should come here and speak to us before they make statements about how our land should be used. And when they come, they should remember we suffered greatly when our villages were destroyed and our homes burnt down so that Kruger could be made bigger,&quot; a Makuleke tribal leader called Gilbert Nwaila told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even today we are the ones who feed those wild animals with our livestock.  (A reference to predators who routinely break the fence and kill goats and cattle in the Mabiligwe resettlement village). Now that we have a chance to get some wealth from that land, we are being told to put even more animals there. It will be very difficult to convince our people that wildlife is better than mining -- and it will be even more so if we are not spoken to properly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're only half-corrupt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is mediocre in the world corruption stakes. Reg Rumney reports on a corruption study that finds the country not so guilty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa ranks right in the middle of a 1995 corruption ranking of 41 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Corruption Ranking is the result of a study done by Berlin-based Transparency International and the University of Goettingen, Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a scale of 0 to 10, South Africa, with a score of 5,62, comes 21st, well ahead in the cleanliness stakes of countries like Argentina, Hungary, Italy, Brazil, and China, to name but a few. South Africa is the only African country ranked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 10 indicates a perfectly clean country, say the authors of the survey, while a zero refers to a country where business transactions are entirely permeated by corruption, involving huge sums in kickbacks, extortion, fraud and the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Indonesia is judged the most corrupt with a ranking of 1,94 New Zealand tops the cleanliness list at 9,55. It is followed by Denmark (9,32) and Singapore (9,26).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Singapore is remarkable in being the only Asian country to be judged among the least corrupt. Most Asian countries found themselves in the company of Italy (2,99), Brazil (2,70), and Venezuela (2,66).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan (6,72), Malaysia (5,28), and Taiwan (5,08) were exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Katz, The Guardian's New York correspondent, reports that in many countries, particularly in Asia, accepting pay-offs is not considered unethical even if westernising governments have sought to make them illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is not cleared completely. The rankings are based on a number of surveys, including three from the World Competitiveness Report. The list states the variance in the rankings. For South Africa, a high variance of 2,35 points to rankings that range from 4,1 to 7,1, indicating a big difference of opinion about how corrupt the country is.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 22, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Carolyn Mwanza</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now almost two months since former president Kenneth Kaunda took over the leadership of UNIP from Kebby Musokotwane, and by now he should have realised it was a very unwise and ill-advised decision to re-enter active politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda, his advisors and persuaders made an erroneous judgment in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interpretation and evaluation of the national political mood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They promised that by installing Kaunda at the helm of UNIP his name and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stature alone would act as a unifying force in the party and would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">automatically bring to an end all the in-fighting and wrangles that have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been the standard state of affairs in the party since December 1991.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, they concluded that the intolerable effects of the Structural</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adjustment Programme (SAP) on the people had created sufficient national nostalgia and that the return of Kaunda to head UNIP would generate a massive and popular frenzy agitating for the return of UNIP to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of these things have happened. Kaunda or not Kaunda, unity in UNIP is still illusory. Three members of parliament have abandoned UNIP, and more are reported set to do so, a clear indication that the Kaunda factor has not insulated the party from schizophrenia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps one very significant error the advisors of Kaunda made is that they overlooked certain salient traits of character that are inherent in Kaunda which could have assisted them in deciding whether Kaunda is emotionally and mentally sufficiently well equipped to lead a political party in a multi-party democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decades as an autocratic ruler must have inured him into nothing else but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">solid and inflexible autocrat. His, therefore, is to issue orders and others to obey, to lecture and others to listen, to decide and others to execute those decisions, to appoint and others to confirm the appointment through a sham and deceitful 'democratic' election, and to dispense and give out favours so that everyone owes him a favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the traits that will divide him from UNIP as he cannot operate in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an atmosphere of free exchange of ideals, debate, compromise and consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should also explain why since he took over the leadership of the party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">almost two months ago he has not been able to enunciate one single idea as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to where and how he intends to lead UNIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because he is psychologically lost as he can't figure out what his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">role is. He is unable to say or do anything out of fear that he might be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stepping on the prerogatives of the secretary general or publicity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">secretary and so on, who might complain publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If only Kaunda could also have realised that it was not that there were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">serious deficiencies in Musokotwane as a leader, but that UNIP as a party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had outlived its usefulness as it has nothing new or fresh to offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent resignations from UNIP to other parties are sufficient proof</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that multi-party democracy is a strange environment for him to operate in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and if this doesn't make him regret his come-back decision, nothing will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ever make him any wiser.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 11 clearing agents are in danger of having their licenses withdrawn</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">if their records are found to be disorderly because they have not acquitted</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commissioner of customs has informed me that ZRA has suspended 11</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agents' licenses in a bid to recover duty from them,&quot; said Mike Colinese,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Clearing and Forwarding Agents Association chairman, in an interview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZRA has taken records from clearing firms for perusal after which some may</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suffer the ultimate penalty of closure if found guilty of non-remittance of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tax.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Agents are supposed to clear their goods within 10 days of the goods entry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into the country. But the problem is that these days include Saturdays and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sundays when customs are not working. On top of that, the customs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">department is short-staffed and fails to attend to agents who want to renew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their bonds,&quot; said Colinese. &quot;Instead, it takes 10 to 21 days to have your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bond renewed after a transaction. Customs have admitted that it is their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lack of staff which contributes to these problems with agents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And vice-chairman of the association Robbie Matambo added that the problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could also be attributed to the devaluation of the kwacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An agent complained to me that, for example, a K500 million bond which was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">once sufficient for him to transact a wide volume of business today means</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he can only clear up to three trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goods on a truck can now reach K200 million. It means the bond is down to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">K300 million. By the time 21 days is up two other trucks would have entered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">putting the agent out of business for while it takes to clear all the goods</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and have the transactions acquitted,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is that the agent has cleared the goods by paying to customs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Lusaka but no one has ticked them off, or acquitted them, in their books</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the Chirundu border. There are not enough staff to do that in time,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said Colinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting commissioner of customs Gordon Murray in an interview on Tuesday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">promised ZRA's position on the matter will soon be made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 18, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transformation of the African political scene in the last few years has been remarkable. In the 1980s, authoritarian, single-party or military regimes were the rule, not only statistically but also ideologically. There was widespread consensus that western-style democracy was not suitable for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now virtually all regimes feel compelled to accept at least in theory the necessity of a democratic transition, although implementation often lags.  Conceptually, democracy has become the norm, and most African countries have experienced at least a partial political opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such transitions, however, have brought with them unexpected challenges, including ethnic conflict. The sharpening of ethnic divisions has been a regular outcome of democratic openings in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This phenomenon challenges the notion that democratisation simply entails a transformation of the political regimes of existing states, to be achieved by amending the country's constitution, holding elections under international supervision, and carrying out complementary activities such as organising human rights monitoring groups, strengthening political parties and educating voters about their rights and duties. Rather, outbreaks of ethnic conflict threaten not only incumbent regimes but also existing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not a new unique phenomenon. Democratisation re-arranged the map of Europe in the 19th century; it has changed drastically that of eastern Europe, the Balkans and central Asia in the last few years. Changes in Africa have so far been less dramatic, with Eritrea and de facto northern Somaliland the only new states so far. But all countries in the Horn remain on the verge of disintegration, and the future of Zaire and Nigeria is in doubt. We can no longer assume that the political transformation of Africa will simply entail a change of regimes. The real danger is not the possibility of the break up of some African countries into new states - this would not necessarily be a problem - but the collapse of an increasing number of states into utter chaos and mass slaughter. The specter haunting Africa is not the possibility of new Eritreas but the likelihood of new Rwandas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relationship between democratic openings and greater ethnic conflict is a complex one, ultimately requiring separate explanations for each country.  Several factors are common to all countries, however. First the present African state system has been crafted by authoritarian regimes that did not feel the need to consult their populations. The most important principle of the Organisation of African Unity, that of the inviolability of colonial borders, denoted such authoritarianism, although this has often been overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It implied not only a renunciation by governments waging war on each other in the pursuit of territory but also a statement by the same governments to their people that they had no right to self-determination. It meant not only that Somalia should stop going to war to conquer the Ogaden, but the Ogadenis would remain Ethiopian subjects whether or not they so desired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the heavy hand of the authoritarian state starts to release its grip, the issue of self-determination is bound to be reopened in many countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second reason why democratising African states are experiencing renewed ethnic conflict is the failure of nation building since independence. While talking of nation building, African leaders devoted themselves mainly to building the state and, above all, their personal power. Most states became patrimonial, predatory and corrupt but also remained soft and eventually faced bankruptcy. Such states do not stimulate the allegiance of their populations and thus help consolidate a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, 30 years after independence African populations remained to a large extent rural, thus they maintained local rather than national identities.  This should not be a matter of surprise. Studies have shown that such local identities still prevailed in the so-called nation-states of Europe in the late 19th century and were slowly weakened, but never completely erased, by industrialisation, universal education, and geographic and social mobility.  Most of these changes have come but slowly to Africa. As a result, democratisation gives a more important role to communities that are local in their outlook, allowing ambitious politicians to play on regional, ethnic and religious identities to gain support. Such manipulation can then turn what was in origin simply harmless identification with a local community into destructive conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African governments have been unwilling to consider seriously the special problems of democracy in multiethnic societies. African leaders are prone to condemn ethnic divisions while manipulating them for their own purposes, but are reluctant to discuss ethnic diversity as a challenge, which entails legitimate demands and special requirements that need to be accommodated by a democratic state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria and South Africa have shown more realism than other countries in dealing with ethnicity in politics. Yet years of constitutional and political engineering since the Biafran civil war have been undermined by the two great constraints of Nigerian politics: the concentration of oil revenue in the hands of the federal government, which precludes genuine decentralisation and empowerment of state and local governments; and the constant intervention of the army in politics, which precludes democratisation. In the end Nigeria remains very far from both democracy and ethnic reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More encouraging, although highly ambiguous, is the case of South Africa, where the African National Congress, in theory committed to a race and ethnicity blind democracy, compromised sufficiently in practice to give the most vocal of ethnic groups, whites and Zulus, special representation in the political system. But the transition in South Africa is too recent, and the compromise too dependent on the good will of a few individuals, to provide clear lessons for other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition of these two countries, where genuine efforts have been made to structure a political system making democracy possible despite ethnic divisions, Ethiopia also is developing a political system that takes the ethnic makeup of the population into consideration. However, the example of Ethiopia so far is one of ethnicisation of the political process but not of democratisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new, ethnicity-based political system has been dictated from the centre. As a result, it has incurred the opposition of most political groups, including the ethnic nationalist movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in the level of ethnic conflict everywhere, and particularly the crisis in Rwanda, have frightened governments and opposition parties in many countries. But fear is not enough. African countries need an arena where the issue of ethnicity in the transition to democracy can be discussed with some detachment from the problems of individual countries, and where some ground rules can be established on how ethnic problems can be tackled without sacrificing democracy. Such a forum may emerge if the proposed Conference on Peace, Security, Stability, Development and Co-operation in Africa (CPSSDCA) comes into existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The (CPSSDCA) is the brainchild of Gen. Olusegun Obasaanjo's African Leadership Forum. Modeled along the lines of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the CPSSDCA is supposed to go beyond the Organisation for African Unity (OAU), which is concerned mainly with relations among states, dealings with its citizen. After an initial meeting in Kampala in May 1991, however, the initiative has bogged down in the politics of the OAU. The underlying problem is the reluctance of many African leaders to set up an organization that would make relations between government and citizen a matter of international concern and commitment, rather than purely the internal affair of each country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revitalisation of the CPSSDCA initiative could make a major difference in ensuring that the democratisation process continues in Africa and in encouraging a more realistic approach to the problem of ethnicity. The problems of Africa and those of Europe are not identical, and African solutions will be different from European ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSCE shows the importance of an international discussion of these problems. It has been active in devising ground rules for ethnically heterogeneous countries. It has drafted charters on the rights of ethnic minorities, on autonomy in local government and on language and education.  Such charters put both governments and mobilised ethnic groups on notice about their duties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 14-16, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Yoweri Museveni is out campaigning to keep his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president is campaigning at a time when what appears an unrelated event is taking place in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Ruling Council's (NRC) Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is embroiled in what is perhaps the most spirited fight again the graft-riddened Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries. PAC has done everything including a raid on the minstry's Entebbe headquarters as officials doggedly continue to frustrate their probe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This PAC effort is double-edged. While on the negative side it brings home sharply to the public the extent of corruption under the NRM government; on the positice side it shows that institutions to fight corruption have been set up, and that some of them, like PAC, have tried to discharge their duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus on the campaign trail, one would have expected the president to exploit such issues to articulate future tasks for government, and to drum up the positives of his rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead the president, apart from repeating his old theme of urging people to fight poverty, is falling into the trap politicians fell into during the Constituent Assembly campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's chosen to play bread and butter politics; giving cows; dishing out bicycles and iron sheets; promising jobs to favourite children in areas he is campaigning in;and even pronouncing on plans to fight baboons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is still morning in the campaigns. If the elections now take place next year, by the time the president finishes his tour of the country, he will have promised iron sheets, bicycles, cows and grinding mills in the millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A presidential campaign is different from a local constituency fight. If the president promises a sub-county bicycles, and the local politician does the same, where is the difference in the call of their offices?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president is running a big risk. Apart from diminishing his status, he can't deliver all that he is promising. There are only a certain number of jobs. In many places in the north, and places like Luwero etc., there are grinding mills and cattle which the president promised years ago and yet haven't been delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NRC Committee on Presidential Affairs recently urged restraint; because there are already billions of shillings worth of promises which President's Office hasn't honoured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president needs to focus his campaign on broad national issues, and a vision of the future. What is the plan to solve the education or health crisis for example? What economic and legal reforms does he plan to press if re-elected? Right now, Museveni is looking too much like a constituency politician. He needs urgently to rediscover his presidential voice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Yoweri Museveni has said that he appointed Dr. Specioza Kazibwe to the post of Vice President because he feared an uprising by women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, who was addressing members of the DRC, elders, opinion leaders and heads of NGOs in Hoima town on August 11, said women are a force to reckon with, &quot;so he thought by leaving them out of big political posts they would one day rise up and overthrow the men.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that in Kazibwe, he saw an able woman leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kazibwe was appointed VP last November, a post she holds together with her other portfolio as Minister for Gender and Community Development. Kazibwe became the first woman vice president in Uganda and only the second in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President said that what is needed now is for people to engage in economic activities which will guarantee them good returns. He expressed concern over the escalating poverty in rural areas. He said his main mission is now to fight uneven development in Uganda. The president said it was now upon the people to fight poverty as the government had completed its task (&quot;Orubimbi&quot;) of providing peace, water and power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier the president donated 20 heifers to women's groups in Hoima and also gave them 200 iron sheets to construct a vocational centre. Bicycles will be donated to every sub-county youth council in Uganda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-American dancers who are on a short visit to The Gambia, have promised to promote The Gambia on their return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chuck Davis, Founding Director of the group, Gambian people are open and made their culture available to them during their visit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that they chose The Gambia for their programme because the people are willing to share their knowledge with others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davis said he has been traveling to The Gambia since the 1970s and the knowledge he gained here is transferred to the people of America through the universities of North Carolina and Duke.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randall Echols, Moshood Abiola's chief lobbyist in the US, was in Nigeria for meetings with General Sani Abacha and Abiola. He discussed his visit to Nigeria at an interview in Washington, DC with Soji Akinrinade, deputy editor-in-chief of Newswatch. Excerpts follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: What is your impression of the situation in Nigeria after your visit and meetings with government officials?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: My impression is that there is widespread disaffection throughout the country. However, in Abuja, where the population density is not bad and other amenities exist, one may not readily notice the disaffection. But after engaging in discussions with individuals within the government and out, I will say that there is some uncertainty as to the direction of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: From your own discussions, did you get any sign from government officials that they know how Nigerians feel about the present situation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: I didn't get that impression, I got the impression that government was ready to position itself in power, and was prepared to do whatever was necessary to see that they got situated in power. There is a lot of effort to appear organised and presidential rather than to deal with the most threatening issues such as the political crisis and the staggering economy.  However, with Abiola and others still detained, it is virtually impossible to effectively address the problem of the economy, the political and social crises that exist in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: When you met with the head of state, what did you tell him? Did you advise him on how to move or not to move Nigeria forward?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: I did not consider myself in the position to advise General Abacha on anything. What I did was to ask General Abacha what should I do here in Washington that will expedite the release of President Abiola. What should I do for him in Washington with the people that I come in contact with on a daily basis -- policy makers, congressmen, senators, etc. -- that will help expedite the release of Abiola? So, &quot;General what can I do for you?&quot; was the approach that I took with General Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: Did you get any response on what you should do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: Well, General Abacha indicated that he was willing to dialogue and I told him that he can get to me and we had scheduled a follow-up meeting, but I got no specific request as to what one could do that would make the situation more tolerable, that will lend itself to the release of Abiola, the sole focus of the mission. My priority was going over to see Chief Abiola, assess his health condition and appeal to government for his release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: Were you able to see Chief Abiola? What situation did you find him, his state of mind and what kind of things did you observe about him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: Well, what I observed is that the chief is being held in complete isolation. Unfortunately there is cruelty associated with his incarceration.  He only has access to the Koran and the Bible. He doesn't have the time, he doesn't have magazines, he doesn't get his medication on a timely basis, he clearly has lost 50-60 lbs. He is walking with a noticeable limp. He is obviously in need of medical attention. This I shared with the government officials after the visit with Abiola. I met with Abacha on a Thursday night.  We met with Abiola the next day at 3 o'clock. Later that night I reported back to Aso Rock my observations. And I shared with them what I am sharing now about my observations that there is something they can do to not have the cruelty associated with his incarceration. And they said they were unaware of these conditions and they promised they will look into them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: Now, when you spoke to government about releasing Abiola, what was their response to that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: What I shared with General Abacha, is that I thought the sanctions and pressure -- economic and diplomatic sanctions -- coming from the United States will only increase as long as Abiola remains incarcerated, as long as the press remains shut down, as long as the other political dissenters remain in jail; that I thought the pressure on Nigeria from outside including the United States would only increase. And that it was my impression that if he will release Abiola, that it will have a pre-emptive effect on the sanctions that are about to come on in Nigeria, and there are more coming, including a number of things that I can't discuss now. But that if he released him, if he shows some willingness to break the stalemate and show the world , as he says, he is interested in dialogue, and to what Abiola said that he was interested in dialogue as well, to reach a peaceful resolution of this political stalemate as a result of June 12 annulment, if he could do that, I thought, and that was what I told him, it will have a pre-emptive effect, nothing guaranteed though. Many of these sanctions I personally initiated. A, along with others, initiated, provided our views to the United States government and other governments as to what could possibly get General Abacha's attention. Now, if he releases Abiola, clearly I will go to some degree to say we see some movement. General Abacha is serious about a peaceful resolution of this problem, and he is not acting dogmatically.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 14, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Soji Akinrinade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months Zubair Mahmud Kazaure, Nigeria's ambassador to the United States of America, was looking for an ace in the hole. He had been fighting an uphill battle to revamp the battered image of Nigeria in the US. He needed more concrete action from the Nigerian government to convince a skeptical American government and people that the Abacha administration is sincere in its efforts to return Nigeria to a genuine democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kazaure got his wish on June 27 when in faraway Abuja, Nigeria's federal capital, the draft constitution and other reports of the Constitutional Conference were submitted to General Sani Abacha. The head of state not only collected the reports, he lifted ban on politics and promised that his transition programme would be released by October.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how the development will help his battle for the ears and minds of the Americans, Kazaure told 'Newswatch': &quot;Tremendously.&quot; He said the administration had proved once again that democracy would son return to Nigeria and that all that was needed was for everyone, including those in the opposition, to work together with the Nigerian government to ensure peace, unity and stability in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambassador had a right to express his optimism. That week, which started Sunday, June 25, was not a particularly good one for the image of Nigeria in the US. Throughout the week one action or the other took place which further damaged Nigeria's standing among the world's democrats and gave the picture of a nation spinning out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week started with a re-run of the Columbia Broadcasting System, CBS, '60 Minutes' Programme on Nigeria. Mike Wallace, the programme's correspondent who visited Nigeria prefaced the re-run by going through the protests from the Nigerian government and the Nigerian embassy in Washington, DC. He ended up saying Nigeria was still the most corrupt nation he had ever reported from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme showed how foreigners are conned into 419 deals and how corrupt Nigerian officials are. Kazaure told 'Newswatch' that the programme was calculated to embarrass Nigeria because of its political problems and that the decision to re-run it must have been taken after a team of Nigerian investigators showed up in New York to ask CBS to give the team access to some of the information they used in putting the documentary together.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CBS programme was only the tip of the iceberg that week. On Tuesday June 276, just as Abacha was receiving the draft constitution, Randall Robinson, executive director, Trans-Africa Forum, who is campaigning for the return of democracy in Nigeria, was on a Worldnet programme fielding questions from Nigerian journalists and others assembled in Lagos and Kaduna by the United States Information Services, USIS, on Nigeria's political problem. The programme was the talk of the diplomatic circle in Washington and showed that Robinson was a formidable foe of the Nigerian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same day Robinson, his supporters and other Nigerians demonstrated in front of the Nigerian embassy on 16th Street, just a stone's throw from Trans-Africa's office. The protest is on everyday. And although dismissed by Kazaure as consisting of Robinson's staff, it puts the Nigerian political problem on the front burner. Robinson himself on Wednesday briefed some members of the Clinton administration's National Security Council on the events in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Thursday, June 29, action shifted to the offices of Shell and Chevron in Washington, DC. The International Roundtable on Nigeria, a coalition of human rights and pro-democracy groups in the DC area, sponsored a demonstration against the two oil companies drawing attention to the plight of the Ogoni people and asking Shell and Chevron to fight for an oil embargo against Nigeria. &quot;No Blood for Oil&quot; read some of the placards carried by protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Events that week are not isolated. In fact, they happen with incredible frequency; if not in Washington, DC then in other cities were pro-democracy and human rights groups have affiliates throughout the United States. For example, in Boston, Massachusetts, the local branch of the Nigerian Democratic Awareness Committee, NDAC, headed by Muhammed Ighile, June 17 presented Nigeria's political situation to the members of that state legislature. Prior to that, the group had organised a protest march against Ibrahim Gambari, Nigeria's permanent representative to the United Nations. It had also on May 20, in conjunction with Trans-Africa, put together a forum to bring the problems of Nigeria to the attention of the Boston community. In Detroit, Michigan, Kofi Egbo's Nigerian Forum for Democracy has been in the vanguard of those boycotting Shell's services and products in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Houston, Texas, through Detroit to New York, activities of the pro-democracy and human rights groups continue to pose serious challenges for the Abacha administration and its representatives in Washington, DC and the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In essence, the events of the week of June 25 were indeed a testimony to the damage that had been caused Nigeria by the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, and by the fact that the most populous nation on earth, one so rich in human and material resources, is still under a military rule when the rest of the world is headed positively towards democracy. And to compound matters, the Nigerian government, in their own estimation, has precious little to show that it is moving fast towards democratisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lifting of the ban on politics and the promise of a transition Programme next October should have helped to produce some positive results and lead to a better understanding of Nigeria by the Americans, if Kazaure had his way. But that apparently is not the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Robinson: &quot;That is not good enough. It will not command any favourable response from the rest of the world. He should release all political prisoners and victims of the trial which is still going on secretly... . In a country where there are no democratic parties, the military retains the right to arrest without charges and trial and to detain people indefinitely. It is hardly possible that you can have a free and democratic activity in any case.  So, that announcement is not satisfactory; it was just pushed out to satisfy critics of the military regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Oparaoji, president of NDAC and a professor at Howard University, Washington, agrees. He too told 'Newswatch' that: &quot;the actions taken so far do not mean anything because there are certain parameters, certain actions that government should take that can make us start believing that they are serious about moving us out of this logjam...which is principally the release of political detainees.&quot; According to him no one could take the government, seriously about lifting the ban on politics since it said, in the next breath, that rallies were still prohibited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the lifting of the ban on politics has not impressed pro-democracy groups in the US, the conviction of 40 persons, including Olusegun Obasanjo, former military head of state and his deputy, Shehu Yar'Adua has certainly compounded Nigeria's image problems. Apart from the human rights groups' claim that the trial and conviction of the accused persons are further evidence of the abuse of human rights in Nigeria, pro-democracy groups have now become more vocal in pressuring the American government to impose oil and trade embargo on Nigeria if those convicted are killed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kazaure has responded by campaigning across America that the trials were fair and conducted according to the laws promulgated, not by this administration but in 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre of the agitation to democratize Nigeria is Washington, DC. But it started as a move to de-annul the June 12, 1993 election and install M.K.O. Abiola, the undeclared winner of the election as president. Randall Echols, a Washington-based lobbyist and Abiola's executive assistant for US affairs, had as early as June 1993 been in the forefront of efforts to get the Nigerian government to de-annul the June 12 election. Since then, however, many pro-democracy groups started mainly by Nigerians have taken over the fight not only for June 12 but for the democratisation of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Santino Makur Kot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until last June, exiled Sudanese opposition leaders and armed rebel movements met more or less clandestinely in neighbouring countries. But in a &quot;bold move&quot;, the Eritrean government openly hosted in the capital, Asmara, a controversial conference of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a Sudanese umbrella movement of both northern and southern opposition groups to agree on a wide range of actions to bring down the regime of General Omar El Bashir, and to work out the basis of an interim administration thereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eritrea broke off diplomatic relations with the Sudan in January this year, following accusations that the Khartoum regime was intent on destabilising Africa's second newest nation after South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then in June, Asmara played host to Sudan's National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella movement that brings together the Arab-Muslim northern opposition parties and the African southern-based politicians and the mainstream faction of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM). The NDA agreed in principal, upon a comprehensive agenda for the overthrow of what participants termed &quot;the repressive regime,&quot; and the basis of the interim period thereafter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those at the conference agreed on a five point plan. The most critical point to many observers is the resolve to end the conflict in the South, through a recognition of the principle of self-determination of the Christian and animist southerners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other points include the implementation of a decentralised administration during the interim period, the setting-up of a secretariat charged with co-ordinating and following up on the activities of NDA constituent groups, the overthrow of General Bashir's regime and the establishment of a secular state where religion plays no part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Asmara conference it is hoped will create a momentum within the broader Sudan opposition for the overthrow of the Khartoum regime of LT. Gen Omar El Bashir who took power in a military coup in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past and for several years, suspicion and mistrust has characterised relations between northerners and southerners. &quot;The Asmara conference, if it was genuine, represents a turning point,&quot; observers noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting traditional rivalries aside, observers further noted that Asmara was the first time northern political parties such as the Umma, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and others, recognised the principle of self- determination for southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition all parties, including the SPLM agreed that the present and previous regimes had distorted the causes of the war in southern Sudan, by describing it as a conflict between Muslims and non-Muslims. This they said, conjures up the religious passions of most people and succeeds in blurring the real causes of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the more controversial issues discussed at Asmara was the problem of regions such as Abyei, the Nuba Mountains and the Ingessina Hills, which although geographically part of the North, are affected by the war. The political future of the regions and the possibilities of their wish to go with southern Sudan was a ticklish issue that remained unresolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference set up a sub-committee of eleven members to follow these issues. They include heads of nine parties: Mohammed Osman El-Mirghani, leader of the DUP as chairman and LT. Gen. Fatih Mohammed Ali, leader of the Legitimate Command as deputy chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others include leader of the SPLM and commander of the SPLM army (SPLA), Col. Dr. John Garang; Dr. Omer Nur El-Dayem, Secretary-General of the Umma Party; Eliaba James Surur, leader of the Union of the African Parties (USAP); Tighani El-Tayeb, leader of the Communist Party of Sudan; and Hashim Mohammed Ahmed, leader of a trade union movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent members who will be in charge of military and organisational matters respectively include Mohammed Tahir Abu Bakir and El-Tayeb. Whereas some members of the sub- committee head parties that are confessional in nature, parties based on religion will not be allowed to register in the envisaged &quot;new Sudan&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants recognised the positive role the Inter-Governmental Authority for Drought and Desertification (IGADD), a regional grouping that has been involved in mediating peace to end the Sudanese conflict, and asked IGADD to incorporate in future peace initiatives the NDA agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics of the Asmara conference are not convinced that the Umma, DUP and other northern parties are genuine in their declared acceptance of secularism and self-determination for the south. This is only a tactical, but temporary political move, to coopt the south in &quot;their bitter rivalry&quot; to overthrow the National Islamic Front (NIF) government, and impose a less fundamentalist but all the same Islamic regime, said one southerner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some northerners also critised the Asmara conference. El-Hadi Bushra, a retired major general and a member of the Legitimate Command, the NDA military wing, described the conference as an affront to Islam and Arabs.  El-Hadi Bushra has since rejoined the regime in Khartoum to &quot;fight for Islam and for the unity of one Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the SPLA faction of John Garang has been accused of signing the Asmara agreement without consulting other &quot;equally important&quot; groups. &quot;This agreement would have been strong enough if the South was united,&quot; said Dr. Amon Wantok member of a south-based group keen on presenting a united front in any negotiations with the north. &quot;The South must stand as a block to deal with any situation at all,&quot; Dr. Wantok stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Asmara plan received another jolt mid this month when Khartoum announced that government troops had on Saturday August 12, captured Kaya, a rebel town on a key supply route near the Ugandan border. John Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army a major partner in the NDA held the town since 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that thousands of northerners powered in the streets of Khartoum to march in celebration of the capture, does not speak well of the northern-dominated NDA and the Asmara agreement,&quot; said an observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march ended at the army's general command where First Vice-President Major-general Al-Zubeir Mohammad Saleh told the crowds all rebel held land would soon be liberated. The army's capture of Kaya, was the first major offensive, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claiming frustration and fatigue, Ghana's Finance Minister, Dr. Kwesi Botchwey quit his post last July and became both a villain and a hero for &quot;getting off&quot; Flt. Lt. Jerry Rawlings' boat at a time when the president needed him most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a villain! No, he is a hero! Opinions may be divided, but in the murky politics of Ghana, it is possible to be both. Dr. Kwesi Botchwey is one such personality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month since he quit the government of Flt. Jerry Rawlings, many Ghanaians are still debating why Dr. Kwesi Botchwey, the country's longest serving Minister of Finance &quot;got off the boat at a most critical point in time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is critical because for most of this year, Ghana has been rocked by cost-of-living protests, with many people saying they had little or nothing to show for (the IMF and World Bank-inspired) economic reforms. At the same time, President Jerry Rawlings and his ruling National Democratic Congress face a general and presidential election in the second half of 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already some opposition parties are considering an alliance that would present one common presidential candidate against NDC's &quot;indomitable airman&quot;.  The least Rawlings expected at this moment in time, is a resignation of his confident and senior minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognising the ideological diversity of opposition parties, Sekou Nkrumah, second son of the founding father of independent Ghana and renowned pan-Africanist, the late Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, last year called on Ghanaians &quot;to face the realities, even though some may not be happy with the alliance.&quot; Sekou Nkrumah is secretary to the publicity committee of the &quot;Nkrumaist&quot; Peoples Convention Party (PCP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings was sworn in as the constitutionally elected president of the country's Fourth Republic for a four year term in January 1992, after winning the controversial presidential race in November of the previous year. This was the third time the military turned-civilian ruler assumed the presidency.  On the first two occasions he assumed office as head of state after successful military coups in 1979 and 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the November 1991 polls, Rawlings, heading the NDC formed out of his former ruling Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC), polled 58.6 per cent of the valid votes cast. His closest rival, Professor Albert Adu Bohaen of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), garnered 30.1 per cent of the votes in a poll the opposition said was rigged with the PNDC acting as &quot;player, referee and match commissioner&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings had been ruling the country for the second time for eleven years, since 1981. In that year, Rawlings stormed out of the barracks yet again to take power from the civilian government of President Hilla Limann to whom he had handed power in 1979, the same year he overthrew Lt. Gen. Fredrick Akuffo and organised elections that Hilla Limann won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite touting Ghana as a World Bank and IMF success story, Rawlings' &quot;civilian rule&quot; has been characterised by greater impoverishing of the population, while enriching &quot;a few traders, well placed exporters and corrupt officials.&quot; For many Ghanaians, Dr. Botchwey's exist means that &quot;some of his policies may be reversed, if for nothing else, to find a scape goat for the government's poor performance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1983 when the country's Economic Recovery Programme started, Dr.  Botchwey has pursued &quot;very harsh economic policies which to all intents and purposes have benefitted a few and impoverished the majority.&quot; However, few people were courageous enough to challenge the then military government of &quot;the same Rawlings&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Botchwey was, however, steadfast and had great belief in the policies he initiated. He almost single- handedly attracted World Bank and IMF support in the recovery programme. His policies of deregulation, restructuring, liberalization and the free market policies propelled the economy into the global market. With the cedi more realistically valued the policies also awakened entrepreneurs to the need for efficient management practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately the policies proved &quot;harsh and painful for the peasants, wage earners and those Ghanaians out of the modern formal sector.&quot; After twelve years of belt-tightening and infusion of billion's of loans into the economy, the life of the ordinary citizen is worse off than before. The growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has meant nothing to them, economists have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country where a clerk in the civil service earns as low as $35.00 a month, while transportation to and from work costs about $18 a month and, rent for a single room without electricity or running water costs about $10 per month it can be argued that Ghana is not in the best of times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education has become a privilege rather than a right with 57 per cent of school going children roaming the streets, either serving as common-carriers or selling iced water and dough-nut. Those in school lack teaching and learning aids which make academic work more efficient and effective. Also the health sector has progressively deteriorated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a week before Botchwey tendered his resignation Catholic bishops in the country issued a pastoral letter on July 14 decrying the state of the economy and its effects on ordinary Ghanaians. The bishops noted that in spite of international financial institutions portraying Ghana's economy as a model for other Third World countries, the state of the economy still leaves much to be desired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upsurge of strikes, demonstrations and other industrial actions, the bishops pointed out, are an index to the dissatisfaction of some Ghanaians facing unemployment, and other economic problems. These have brought about high exodus of Ghanaians to other countries, particularly Europe, in search of greener pastures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tragedy is that many of these become criminals and find themselves in prisons everywhere, in the process, dragging the name of Ghana into the mud,&quot; lamented the bishops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops also expressed grave reservation about the health policy of the Government particularly the freeze on the employment of paramedical personnel and the redeployment of 15 per cent of personnel in Church hospitals who are on Government payroll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action on the part of the Government, the bishops noted, is seriously affecting the activities of Church-owned hospitals which are allocated in rural areas. &quot;We would wish to believe that the Government is averse to a situation where we are forced either to close down our hospitals or downgrade them to the level of clinics or health posts, as this will spell disaster for our already marginalised rural dwellers.&quot; But it is an option that cannot easily be discounted if the Government persists in carrying out such a policy, stressed the bishops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the country's educational system the bishops appealed to the Government to pay particular attention to the plight of students and the teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the closure of three of the country's national Universities, the bishops urged that a quick and lasting solution be found to the impasse between the Government and the University Teachers Association of Ghana (UTAG). The UTAG has embarked on a strike since April 1995 over salary scales which the Government has refused to meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rightly or wrongly, Botchwey has been blamed for all these unpopular reforms in the economy, irrespective of their contribution to GDP. &quot;GDP in any case,&quot; critics argue, &quot;is not a measure of the well being of a people in backward economies where the distribution of wealth is heavily skewed in favour of a handful.&quot; Dr.Botchwey has also been accused of supervising &quot;the rape of the national treasury&quot; to fund the 1992 general elections that resulted in a whooping cedis 170 billion (US$170) deficit. Of this amount about cedis 120 billion could not be accounted for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On these accounts Botchwey, who is also said to be shying away from presenting, in an election year, a &quot;difficult budget&quot; that will include the already controversial Value Added Tax, is considered a villain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for opposition political activists, any member of the ruling party, and for that matter a senior government minister, who &quot;sees the light&quot; and quits the &quot;discredited NDC government&quot; is a hero.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Odhiambo James</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massive human rights violations continue to take place in Africa, in streets and in prison cells, with both governments and opposition groups perpetrating heinous abuses, charges the Amnesty International (AI) report for 1994. Torture, using methods that include chaining prisoners and suspending them upside down, rape, electrical shocks, suffocation with rubber and the use of tight leg shacks remained a widespread reality in 33 African countries, further tarnishing the bartered image of the continent. Our APS writer reviews the &quot;changing pattern&quot; of violations documented in the AI report that was released in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty years since the demise of the brutal colonial administration, a review of the African press reads very familiar, but at the same time very disturbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some common lines illustrate the point: &quot;The New York-based Human Rights Watch, Africa has expressed concern over police action in dispersing a crowd of peaceful demonstrators.&quot; The former colonial power has joined other Western donors to &quot;urge the government to respect human rights and hinted on cutting aid.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the lines that authorities love to hate, continue on and on. It is as if nobody, including those in and outside government, care about the image of the African continent and her people, or the implications for development, investment and international reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only Ethiopia and South Africa recorded any improvement on the human rights scorecard according to the 1994 Amnesty International (AI)report released last month. Elsewhere it was the gory business as usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 200 people were sentenced to death in 1994 in 13 African countries, with more than 1,000 people in 15 countries remaining under sentence of death from previous years. More than 200 were actually put to death, the AI report states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar trend was experienced elsewhere in much of Africa, with armed opposition groups equally committing serious human rights abuses, including torture, hostage taking or deliberate and arbitrary killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Maghreb region - Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Western Sahara and Morocco - appalling human rights violations were committed by governments and their agents. This included imprisonment of prisoners of conscience, judicial and extra judicial executions, &quot;disappearances&quot;, torture, arbitrary political detention and unfair trials of political prisoners. Many people died in police custody as a result of torture or ill treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of civilians were killed by armed Islamist groups especially in Algeria. Women, lawyers and journalists appeared to be prime targets in some of the Maghreb countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Central Africa especially in the Sudan, the government arrested hundreds of suspected opponents, trade unionists, journalists and lawyers. Many were prisoners of conscience, most were detained without charge or trial for up to a few months, some in secret detention centres called &quot;ghost houses&quot;. Scores were tortured in Chad and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International also documented human rights abuses by the Rwanda Patriotic Army, which gained control of Rwanda in July 1994 and formed the new government. Hundreds, if not thousands, of captured opponents and unarmed civilians suspected of participating in genocidal killings were summarily executed. Others were detained and killed or &quot;disappeared&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between April and July 1994 an estimated 32,000 people were held in detention without charge or trial. Many prisoners died because of overcrowding. There were also numerous reports of ill-treatment, especially in secret jails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burundi, thousands of Hutus were targeted in politically motivated massacres by the Tutsi-dominated security forces and associated armed groups.  The government failed to control the armed forces or prevent Hutu and Tutsi extremists from arming themselves and carrying out killings. An almost complete breakdown of law and order ensued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In West Africa, Nigeria carried out at least 100 executions in 1994. In Gabon, overcrowding amounted to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment leading to 67 prisoners suffocating to death in a single incident. Another 150 died in one prison in Cameroon because of inadequate diet and lack of medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sierra Leone, where distinction between government soldiers and rebels has become blurred, soldiers tortured, ill-treated and extra judicially executed, captured insurgents or those suspected of being rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Somalia, hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed, including women and children, while in Djibouti scores were tortured. However, says the Amnesty report, positive steps were witnessed in Ethiopia where the government released thousands of opponents detained in the past two years. Authorities also started to bring charges against members of previous government detained since 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In East Africa, Tanzania secretly executed eight. Kenya had the largest number of death-row inmates with 26 prisoners sentenced to death during 1994.  This brought the death row population to 568. Uganda held hundreds under sentence of death at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Southern Africa, in Mozambique's second year of peace, police torture and ill-treatment by security forces continued to be reported in 1994.  Commissions were set up under the peace agreement to monitor the police and security services, but these ended up investigating human rights abuses by police and soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi's first multiparty elections in more than 30 years unseated Dr.  Hastings Kamuzu Banda, whose government had been responsible for widespread human rights abuses. After the election, over 100 prisoners on death row had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. An investigation was launched into the suspicious deaths of three government ministers and a member of parliament in 1983. But Amnesty International continued to receive reports of police ill-treatment of suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world's attention was on South Africa in 1994, as the country's first non- racial national elections were held. The new government established a commission to promote and protect human rights and signed human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the elections, political violence subsided in most of the country, though by the year's end, the toll of political killings rose sharply in Natal Province (KwaZulu-Natal) with at least 75 people killed in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the major highlights of the 1994 Amnesty International report is that women continue to be targeted for state repression. Women suffered every abuse and violation of fundamental rights, including sexual harassment and threats of rape. Some of the women-victims were innocent wives of political activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cases involving women were recorded in some 15 countries among them Algeria, Chad, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan. In the run up to the September 1995 United Nations Conference on Women to be held in Beijing, China, Amnesty International is calling on governments to restate their commitment to women's entitlement to all human rights and to take concrete measures to protect these rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With growing human rights violation throughout Africa, so have the continent's social, political, cultural and economic crises worsened. The report updated to cover January-May 1995 highlights &quot;notorious&quot; human rights violations in Sudan, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Burundi, Rwanda and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the eve of the &quot;second liberation&quot; only five years ago, African political, business and other leaders recognised at various forums that: &quot;The absence of security for citizens, and the pervasive lack of democracy and respect for human rights are to a large extent responsible for Africa's predicament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This state of affairs has in particular made popular mobilisation and effective accountability difficult. It has also further marginalised Africa in the world economy, while political leaders suffer from loss of legitimacy and respect,&quot; noted the International Conference on Popular Participation in Recovery and Development Process in Africa held at Arusha, Tanzania in February 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subsequent (Arusha 1990) African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and Transformation said in part: &quot;We believe that for people to participate meaningfully in their self- development, their freedom to express themselves and their freedom from fear must be guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This can only be assured through the extension and protection of people's basic human rights and we urge all governments to vigorously implement the African Charter on Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ILO Convention No.87 concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless citizens are still tempted to ask: When will Africa create a climate where impunity will prevail no more? When will the perpetrators be brought to justice? When are the victims going to be given back their dignity as human beings? When will Africa create a free atmosphere for the African people to really contribute optimally to the development and growth of their continent as free and happy human creatures? When?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) August 18 - Churches operating in southern Sudan have protested to the Canadian Government over the oil exploration activities of a Canadian multinational corporation, Arakis Energy Corporation, in the region and its implications for peace initiatives to end the Sudanese conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a strongly-worded letter the New Sudan Council of Churches draws the attention of the Canadian Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister, Andre Quellet, to &quot;the consequences of Arakis Energy Corporation business dealing with the Sudan Government and on the future of IGADD peace initiatives in which your Government is one of the supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arakis Energy Corporation has purchased Sudan's State Petroleum Corporation, giving the multinational a 100 per cent interest in blocks covering five million hectares and option to acquire another 12 million hectares. The fields were previously abandoned by the American firm-Chevron Overseas Petroleum International. Now Arakis' goal is to raise US$750 million to build a pipeline from the Hegleg and Unity oil fields, in the Bebtiu region, to Port Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the oppressed people of southern Sudan feel let down by the Canadian Government because of the action of Arakis, the NSCC says, adding that: &quot;While we acknowledge with appreciation that Canadian policy towards the Islamic Government is one of diplomatic pressure, we feel dismayed at your policy, which separates human rights concerns from trade related matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can business opportunities exist in a country like Sudan,&quot; asks the letter, &quot;where citizens are humiliated, tortured and killed just because they happen to belong to a different religion and race or colour?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IGADD peace initiatives, which the Canadian Government fully supports, could also be jeopardised when multinational companies like Arakis engage in business, which is bound to &quot;harden the heart of the Islamic regime towards any peace process,&quot; the NSCC further asserts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter signed by the NSCC Executive Secretary, Rev. (Dr.) Haruun L.  Ruun asks the Canadian government to &quot;do everything in your power to encourage Arakis to disinvest in Sudan in order to persuade the Sudan to opt for peaceful solution in the current civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another protest note to the Chief Executive Officer of Arakis Energy Corporation, Terry J. Alexander, the NSCC says: &quot;We are writing this letter to raise objection to your economic activities in the Sudan. We are deeply concerned about the consequences of such business activities at the time when the international community is putting pressure on the fundamentalist Islamic regime in Khartoum to reach a peaceful end to the conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NSCC urged Arakis to disinvest in Sudan, and join other multinational firms in campaigning for a just and lasting peace in the country. &quot;It is only when that nation is in peace that a conducive atmosphere for investment can become meaningful not only for investors but also the nation and its people,&quot; the letter stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Toronto, Canada-based Inter-Church Coalition on Africa (ICCA), Arakis intends to have the pipeline complete as early as October, 1996. This would help it swing into partial production of between 65,000-85,000 barrels a day, shortly thereafter, with indication that it could reach its full production of an estimated 100,000 barrels per day by January 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If such rapid development is actually feasible, the Government of Sudan could be reaping the fruits very soon&quot;, the Canadian church body said in a report. &quot;It is imperative that as much pressure as possible be put on Arakis,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Sudan Independent Movement (SSIM) has also protested the exploitation of &quot;critical strategic minerals&quot; in South Sudan when the war is still raging. The SSIM said it would sabotage any project by Arakis Energy Corporation to build a pipeline from Liech State (Bentiu) Upper Nile, where the oil is, to Port Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The SSIM, its army and the people of South Sudan will not allow the Government to finance its forces of occupation for a Jihad (holy war) against the South with our oil,&quot; said the SSIM in a statement the movement faxed to APS. The Sudan People's Liberation Movement has also called on Arakis to &quot;abandon its plans on the oil exploration business where she is working hand in hand with the Khartoum Government.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA (APS) August 18 - Ethnic violence continues to spiral in Burundi with some 93 people massacred in a week of bloody attacks between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis. In the first incident, a 100-strong Hutu militia unit on August 7 slaughtered 58 displaced Tutsis, 25 of them children, using machetes and knives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement released by the Burundian government said the militia, who attacked the Kaburantwa displaced persons camp in northwestern province of Cibitoke, did not use guns to avoid alerting nearby soldiers of the Tutsi-dominated army. The assailants fled into Zaire after the attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second attack, exactly a week later, assailants armed with grenades and machetes killed 30 people in the central Burundi province of Karuzi, the state radio reported, but did not specify the ethnicity of the attackers or victims in apparent fear of reprisal killings that could easily degenerate in massive bloodletting. Another 5 people were killed by unidentified attackers in Bujumbura and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, killings by one ethnic group have usually been followed by reprisal killings by the other especially in the capital Bujumbura. Victims in reprisal killings are in many cases innocent civilians whose only crime is their tribe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few Hutus today remain in Bujumbura following &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; which started in March. Those still in the capital especially in the northern suburbs of Kamenge and Kinama, frequently take to the nearby hills as Tutsi soldiers and militiamen battle with Hutu militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the massacres in the first week of this month, a brief period of relative calm followed the visit to Burundi by UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in mid-July, who appealed for reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the same month the Anglican Archbishop of South Africa, Rt. Rev.  Desmond Tutu made a pastoral visit to Burundi on a mission to support reconciliation efforts in that country. But despite the two visits, killings are now reported virtually daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu, who is also the current President of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) with a membership of over 140 Churches and associate National Christian Councils (NCCs) in more than 38 African countries, arrived in Burundi on July 27 at the head of an AACC delegation to consult withchurch leaders on the role of the Church in the process of national reconciliation. Bishop Tutu proceeded to Rwanda on Saturday July 29, on a similar mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Burundi, Bishop Tutu preached at different churches and other sites on issues related to reconciliation. His sermons culminated in a public rally and prayers for the nation in the national stadium in Bujumbura. His sermon focused on the general theme: &quot;Christ our Hope&quot;. Tutu, a Nobel Peace Winner, also met with top political leaders in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all his meetings Archbishop Tutu, stressed the need for the restoration of peace among the &quot;suffering Burundians.&quot; Said he: &quot;This is God's world. God is in-charge. If peace and stability can come to South Africa, it can and will also come to Burundi&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, Boutros-Ghali asked the UN Security Council to set up an international judicial inquiry into the death of Burundi's first Hutu elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, and the ensuing killings. The atmosphere of impunity was a major obstacle to reconciliation, Boutros-Ghali stressed.  Ethnic killings had been estimated at between 20 to 40 before the visit of Ghali and Tutu and virtually all killers went scot- free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army accuses Burundi Hutu extremists of cooperating with Rwandan Hutus in Zairean refugee camps, some of whom were members of the Interahamwe militias. This militia carried out the worst massacres during Rwanda's civil war last year, slaughtering more than 500,000 Tutsis, moderate Hutus and their families. The Rwandans in the camps are reported to be rearming, training and carrying out cross-torder guerrilla raids into Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Organisation of African Unity (OAU) delegation, headed by Nagash Kibrat, a special envoy of OAU chairman and Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi, is currently touring Uganda, Zaire, Rwanda, Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania and Burundi for talks on how to diffuse the escalating tension and put an end to the killings in Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) August 18 - A new body of churches, which aims to &quot;keep the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) is on its toes and to work closely with the Government&quot; has finally gained legal recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Regional Fellowship of Churches of Kenya (RFCK), whose interim General Secretary, Rev. John Wycliffe Wanga, is a former employee of the NCCK, was registered on July 28, under Section 10 of the country's Societies Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued at the end of the new organisation's interim Executive Committee meeting held at Kenya's Lake Victoria town of Kisumu, 400 km North-west of Nairobi, said the RFCK &quot;aims to work closely with the Kenyan Government for the welfare of Kenyans and to keep the NCCK on its toes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not worried of the new Christian body. Our main concern is the tone of some of the statements the officials of the new body are currently making,&quot; the NCCK General Secretary, Rev. Mutava Musyimi told</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APS in an interview. &quot;It's our strong belief that such a new Christian body, should target at challenging us positively. There is too much that is yet to be accomplished in our pastoral mission,&quot; the NCCK chief further said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The long-time monopoly held by the NCCK is at long last broken and we will make survival difficult for them now that RFCK is formally registered,&quot; Rev.  Wanga is reportedly said to have told the Kisumu meeting of his interim Executive Committee. Officials of the new body have also accused the NCCK of being too political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also claimed during the meeting that at least 40 independent churches and three dioceses of the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) were said to have sought membership of the RFCK. The new christian body, which intends to establish its headquarters at Eldoret, about 200 kilometres, north-west of Nairobi, is particularly targeting churches in the Rift Valley, Nyanza and Western provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with APS, an interim official of RFCK who sought anonymity, said &quot;most of our members are former members of the NCCK, who have remained dissatisfied with the NCCK for a long time; but with no alternative. We have simply come to their rescue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rev. Musyimi has refuted these claims saying that &quot;we have already carried out a survey in the said areas and to our satisfaction, no member of the NCCK has officially left us for another church body.&quot; With a current membership of 38 churches, the NCCK is one of the largest and oldest national council of churches in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A legal adviser and trustee to the RFCK, David Ngala, said some members of the NCCK in parts of the Nyanza, Rift Valley nd Western Kenya areas, became dissatisfied with the way money, donated by ecumenical donor agencies for community projects was distributed. Most churches in these regions had a low deal and chose to leave NCCK, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The creation of a new church body, according to Rev. Wanga, has been necessitated by concerns that have been expressed by international organisations sponsoring the NCCK. He said the sponsors complained that funds they have donated in the past have not benefitted the projects they were intended for. He added: &quot;Donors had recommended for the formation of regional bodies through which any funds they donate can be channelled to community-based projects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On allegations that NCCK had become &quot;too political&quot;, the NCCK boss was quick to retort that it was not possible for churches to &quot;disengage&quot; because politics affects all God's people both christians and non- christians alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Musyimi said he doubted whether the new church body was not politically geared. &quot;Going by recent developments, I would not be surprised if the RFCK was a politically-supported plot to finish NCCK,&quot; said Rev.  Musyimi. He also denied allegations of misappropriation of funds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FREETOWN (APS) August 18 - President Strasser has reiterated his government's readiness &quot;at any time, anywhere&quot; to open peace talks with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), despite the rebel movement's rejection of an invitation to attend a national conference to discuss how to return war-torn Sierra Leone to civilian democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the opening session of the conference on Tuesday August 15, the head of Sierra Leone's military junta, Captain Valentine Strasser, told delegates that the four-year civil war &quot;remained the largest single obstacle to the democratic process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are prepared any day anywhere to begin unconditional talks with the rebel movement about the need for a general cessation of hostilities,&quot; Captain Strasser, 29, told the meeting, especially organised to discuss practicalities of holding elections at the end of this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Strasser's government has promised to hand over power to an elected administration early next year after lections planed to take place at the end of 1995. But with nearly 40 per cent of Sierra Leone's 4.5 million people currently displaced, many observers feel the only form of election that could be organised would be a highly modified form of proportional representation.  Many Sierra Leoneans feel the vote should be postponed until the war is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days of registration of political parties ended on August 14, with 17 parties provisionally registered, among them the All People's Congress (APC).  The one-time sole party was overthrown by junior officers in a coup on April 29, 1992 that brought Captain Strasser's National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) to power. The NPRC immediately banned all political parties, only lifting the ban in June this year in the run-up to the proposed vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RUF leader Foday Sankoh launched his rebellion in the extreme south-east of the country in late March 1991, initially to overthrow former military leader General Joseph Momoh, who fled to neighbouring Guinea where he still lives today. The war has claimed over 10,000 lives, according to official statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interim National Electoral Commission (INEC) chairman, James Jonah, a former UN under secretary- general, said that Foday Sankoh's RUF had not replied to an invitation to join the three-day conference. The conference was sponsored by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) as a &quot;reaffirmation of its support&quot; for Sierra Leone's march towards multiparty democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We issued an invitation through a third party, but up to this moment, we have not received any response,&quot; Jonah said. &quot;I regret this very much as this is an opportunity for the RUF to join other Sierra Leoneans to chart a new course for the country,&quot; he declared just before the conference opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the INEC, 155 delegates finally took part, another 250 &quot;observers&quot; were allowed in on condition they paid their own expenses. Jonah stressed popular sentiments here that &quot;unless the RUF is willing to sit for round-table talks peace will remain a mirage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates included representatives of student organisations, Universities, trade unions, women's groups, traditional chiefs and representatives of Sierra Leonean refugees currently living in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia.  Jonah also urged delegates &quot;to avoid the influence of money, bribery and corruption in their discussions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) August 18 - Over 1000 women from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Sudan and Somalia converged on Kenya's Nairobi University for a &quot;Mini-Beijing&quot;, in rehearsal of the forthcoming women's conference in China.  Among issues addressed at the three-day event were economic empowerment and poverty reduction among women. Cultural problems, family and socialization, and violence against women were also discussed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mini-Beijing (August 10-12) was organised to get women's views particularly those that will not travel to China, and to agree on priorities and how to champion them. The women, representing various interest groups shared experiences and views in workshops, plenary sessions and exhibitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But grassroots women, who according to some experts bear the brunt of discrimination, expressed disappointment at having been left out of the preparations. They said their urban counterparts had not briefed them adequately and they had only relied on radio information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman charged that, &quot;rural women have been take for granted for too long.&quot; Other rural women expressed fears that they will not be fully represented in the Beijing UN women's meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the opening day, a &quot;torch of peace&quot; from South Africa that will be taken around several East and Central African countries before African women delegates leave for Beijing, was lit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The September 14-15 Beijing conference will be the fourth world conference on women, the first having been held in Mexico in 1975. The Beijing conference is expected to discuss strategies to remove obstacles to the advancement of women. Some of critical areas of concern identified include poverty, inequality in education, health care, employment and economic participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an earlier pre-conference continental preparatory meeting, over 5000 African women met in Dakar, Senegal, in November 1994, to come up with a common &quot;African Platform for Action&quot;. For each of the 11 areas identified under the &quot;Dakar Platform&quot; the women proposed measures to be implemented by various organisations and agencies under the leadership of national governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognising that women were the primary victims of poverty, the platform stresses the need for specific policies to support female-headed families, which now represent 35 per cent of all households in Africa. The platform further calls for special economic programmes for poor women, especially in the informal and agricultural sectors, and urges for changes in gender-biased laws that limit the economic potential of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other crucial areas covered at Dakar included property rights, land rights, inheritance and asset holdings. &quot;The women's rights had been abused for too long&quot;, the women said, adding that to reverse this trend:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was imperative for gender concerns to be integrated into environmental impact assessments and the overall development process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nairobi Mini-Beijing further discussed these and other issues such as women and the peace process in Africa; women, political empowerment and decision making; women, agriculture and food security; and women and the media. Also discussed were concerns of health and women's reproductive rights, women's legal and human rights and issues pertaining to the youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of these issues which are incorporated in the African Platform for Action adopted in Dakar last year, include a section on the girl-child, making Africa the only region treating this issue very seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIBREVILLE (APS) August 18 - President Omar Bongo of Gabon, the mainland country nearest to Sao Tome, has condemned the coup in the island nation of Sao Tome and Principe, and warned that international military action like the one which led to the reinstatement of Haitian President Bertrand Aristide could be undertaken if the coup leaders refused to heed calls to return the country to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar Bongo's call was supported by France, whose foreign ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux also warned that if &quot;constitutional legality was not restored, there will be consequences as far as our cooperation is concerned.&quot; The French warning followed a threat by the European Commission, which said it would suspend development aid if ousted President Trovoada was not reinstated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel soldiers struck in the tiny West African island nation of Sao Tome and Principe on Tuesday August 15, and seized power in a bloodless coup, ousting the first democratically elected President Miguel Trovoada. The soldiers declared a National Salvation Council to rule the country for the next 90 days pending arrangements for new elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insurrection on the islands located 300 kilometres (185 miles) off the coast of Gabon and populated by only 130,000 people, was led by Sub-Lieutenant Fernando Sousa Ponte &quot;Craque&quot; and Quintas de Almeida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the takeover, the two coup leaders said that &quot;a democratic military coup d'etat&quot; was justified by a social crisis in the country. Ponte, leader of new regime, further said his comrades in the 600 strong army wanted to put an end to &quot;corruption, indiscipline and disorder in the country,&quot; before elections could be organised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite prompt assurances to return the nation to civilian democratic governance within three months, news of the coup triggered disquiet in many quarters apart from Gabon and France. In Washington, a State Department spokesman condemned the takeover and said aid to Sao Tome and Principe, valued at some one million dollars annually, could be at risk because of the putsch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Addis Ababa, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) condemned the coup and demanded that the government be reinstated. &quot;This is an era of dialogue and democracy. Whatever grievances there were in Sao Tome should be addressed through dialogue and not force,&quot; said OAU spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after the coup announcement, diplomatic envoys of Portugal, Sao Tome's former colonial master, and of Angola, another former Portuguese colony, appealed for clemency for the ousted leaders. Portuguese President Mario Soares said his country was ready to offer sanctuary to Trovoada if the coup leaders and the deposed president agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Carlos Graca, who was on the island of Prencipe when the coup took place, said he had not foreseen the coup. But he said he had recognised the population's unhappiness with social conditions, adding: &quot;I am at home and I am well, but I cannot answer any questions because the National Salvation forbids me to make any statement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portugal became the first European power to &quot;discover&quot; Sao Tome and Principe in 1471. The two islands became a Portuguese colony in 1522, before gaining independence on July 12, 1975. The islands make up one of the poorest countries in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the coup, Trovoada, 58, led the country since April, 1991. He recently called for a government of national unity to tackle the problems facing his administration after the country was hit by a crippling economic crisis. The crisis in recent months had forced civil servants, including teachers and doctors, to stage several strikes to ask for massive wage increases of between 300 and 1, 000 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October last year, the former monopoly party of deposed Prime Minister Graca, the Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP), won general elections leading to a period of uneasy co- habitation with Trovoada's Party of Democratic Action. Then in July 1994, Justice Minister Manuel Vaz Fernandes resigned and sources said he might head the campaign of former president Manuel Pinto da Costa for the presidential election scheduled for early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Da Costa, who ruled the country from Independence in 1975 to 1991, also offered to mediate, saying he had already been in contact with coup leaders.  &quot;The first contact was positive. I don't accept this military coup as I would not accept anything which could put the democratic regime in danger,&quot; Da Costa declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we went to press coup leaders had agreed to start talks with various political groups in an apparent bid to set up a government national unity, while Travoada and Graca remained in detention.</SPAN></P>

Mrema is a former Deputy Premier and Cabinet Minister who quit the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (Revolutionary Party) in a fit of anger over corruption issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time Abdulrahman Babu, a former Cabinet Minister in the immediate post-independence government, ended more than 15 years of self exile in Europe to return home as a potential running mate for Mrema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babu received a tumultous welcome home when his plane landed at Dar es Salaam airport on August 4, and immediately told a press conference that he would throw his weight behind the opposition. Since former President Julius Nyerere was openly campaigning for Benjamin Mkapa, the presidential candidate for Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), said Babu, he would also support Mrema, said Babu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babu, a former political detainee in Zanzibar where he was born 76 years ago is seen by observers as a political heavy weight who will provide some counter weight to Nyerere's support for the CCM candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year Nyerere urged Tanzania's mushrooming political parties to think seriously of establishing a post-election government of national unity.  &quot;It is clear now, however, that Nyerere would prefer Mkapa to be an outright winner,&quot; the opposition has charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere's own son, Charles Makongoro Nyerere, a defector from the CCM to the NCCR-Mageuzi, reminded his father that the time was gone when Tanzania was a single party State. &quot;A President for Tanzania could emerge from a party other than CCM,&quot; he asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a senior member of the CUF, Mr. Gideon Nipewa, has warned Nyerere that the opposition would adopt a common strategy against him. He charged that Nyerere who was in power for 23 years until 1985, had ruined the economy with his &quot;misguided socialist policies&quot; termed Ujamaa. The policies were based on getting the country's scattered population in communal villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed Babu himself decried the poverty of Tanzanians upon his return. He said Tanzanians were worse off now than before independence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (APS) August 10 - A coalition of over 30 religious organisations throughout the United States, The Religious Working Group on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been formed to address justice issues surrounding the two Bretton Woods global financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formed at Bretton Woods in the USA, the World Bank and IMF have pursued lending strategies that have impoverished people and communities in the Third World, devastated the environment, and created impossible debt burdens for the poor. In Africa, the debt burden estimated at $164 billion is forcing most sub-Sahara Africa to forego investment in education, health, industry and agricultural production.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;debt crisis&quot; has been exacerbated by the continued fall of commodity prices, prompting the governing body of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), known as the General Committee, to call on the international community to address more critically the African debt burden, the IMF/World Bank terms vis a vis poor countries, and the unfair trading practices of the international market place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued nearly two years ago, the AACC General Committee against a background of rampant human rights abuses, proposed that &quot;African countries be accorded a moratorium of 12 months during which time their respective records on human rights, democratisation and meaningful development would be scrutinised as a basis for debt cancellation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling for greater World Bank and IMF accountability, an end to current structural and sectoral adjustment programmes and the cancellation of debt in the most severely affected countries, the new Religious Group (RWG) has produced a Declaration for Change, signed by hundreds of U.S. religious leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ecumenical group, comprised of Methodist, Unitarian, Mennonite, Baptist, Episcopal, United Church of Christ, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Catholic and secular organisations, institutions and individuals, plans to organise a number of events to coincide with the October 1995 World Bank/IMF annual meetings in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, October 7 and Sunday, October 8, 1995, a forum on alternatives to the global economy will be held by the U.S. Fifty Years is Enough Campaign which has spent the past year educating participating groups on the issues of debt and development, a press statement issued by the United Church Board for World Ministries here, says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, Monday October 9, there will be a press conference at noon, a public rally, and an Ecumenical Prayer Service and Candlelight Vigil at 7 p.m., led by Mexican Bishop and Nobel Peace Prize Nominee, Samuel Ruiz, a key figure in negotiating a peaceful settlement of the Chiapas revolt. Also speaking at the service will be religious and lay leaders from around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, high-level meetings with World Bank and IMF officials are being arranged, and public vigils will be held by individual groups and denominations from October 10 through 12, outside the World Bank and IMF meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RWG is facilitated by the Maryknoll Society Justice and Peace Office in Washington, DC. The United Church of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) are represented in the RWG through the Division of Overseas Ministries and the Board for World Ministries, as well as hundreds of activists across the North America.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan musicians whose litany of woes include the sorry tale of &quot;rags to more rags&quot; seem to have found a new lease of life in gospel music, which appears to be increasingly popular with local music fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimani Thomas, formally of Mbiri Stars today &quot;cooes for the Lord&quot;. Augustus Barasa, once a vocalist cum-drummer with Toddy National band, is now with the Revival Flames, serenading fans with such gospel hits as &quot;Yahweh! Yahweh!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of Kenyan musicians who have abandoned secular music for gospel tunes in recent years is as varied as it is impressive. The nearly endless list reads like a roll call of popular local artists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Sanna, once a saxophonist of the famous Mangelepa, who enthralled fans with acrobatic stage shows now &quot;sings for the Lord&quot;. He refers to night clubs, whose fat he once lived-off, as places &quot;full of sleazy things, easy sex, and excessive alcohol consumption.&quot; His former mate, Bwami Walumona, sings gospel music too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Munyau, a sales manager at Assaatholic and the Lutheran churches' stand on church and politics, stressing that the Church has every right to ask questions on all matters affecting the life of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the country's forthcoming general elections, scheduled for October 29, the CCT document challenged the government to see to it that all officially registered political parties are allowed full freedom and that all legible Tanzanians can exercise their right to choose (vote) in a free atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a specific question the CCT General Secretary, Rev. Angetile Y. Musomba told APS in a telephone interview that the document was the general effort of all churches, both Protestant and Catholic, in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It represents the pastoral concern of churches on the current situation in the country and the need to stress upon Tanzanians to exercise their right to vote and to seek for leadership positions, putting the good of the country before their personal ambitions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Sam Gonza</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forsaken by France, The United States, Belgium and other Western nations who have always quietly supported him, Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko is now hopeful that his prime minister and confidant, Kengo wa Dondo who has the enthusiastic support of donor nations will salvage his image. However, despite major setbacks, opposition and grassroot church groups across Zaire are now intensifying the battle of wits to recapture the political initiative from the government and put the democratisation process back on course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month since the end of the transition period, Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku wa Zabanga is still president of Zaire. Fresh killings of peaceful demonstrators in Kinshasa at the end of July confirm that Mobutu, who has been in power for 30 years, remains obstinate and can still act drastically with or without a mandate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protestors, members of the pro-Lumumbist PALU Party, were gunned down by gendarmes as they tried to reach the Peoples Palace (Parliament) to register their anger that Mobutu was still firmly in power after the five year transition period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transition period, decreed by the Sovereign National Conference in the early 90s, was supposed to allow for the gradual dismantling of Mobutu's dictatorial machinery, and lead to elections. Instead, Mobutu seems politically more sure of himself than ever. The elections are no where in sight, corruption continues unabated with Lebanese diamond and gold buyers, allegedly receiving protection from the Special Presidential Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile soldiers remain un-paid for months and could unleash another round of looting sprees that could yet again, further damage the economy. The President himself continues to be accused of sabotaging the economy so that &quot;the clique in power&quot; may continue to benefit from the &quot;parallel economy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this background, the mainstream opposition, the Sacred Union of Radical Opposition Allies, (USORAL), led by Etienne Tshisekedi, Kibassa Maliba, Mende Omanga and others have served notice that they will start a campaign of disobedience and demonstrations to try and force the government to restore the democratic process. &quot;Killings and terror tactics by Mobutu would not deter us&quot;, officials of USORAL which is working for change in Zaire said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the aspirations of the Zairean people mirrored through USORAL is a transparent process towards real democracy, respect for the decrees of the Sovereign National Conference, a free and independent press and Judiciary as well as respect for human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years ago when the &quot;wind of change&quot; toppled many despotic regimes in Eastern Europe, there was also pressure for African dictators to conform to a &quot;New World Order&quot;. Then on April 24, 1990, President Mobutu announced he would introduce democratic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such was the euphoria that swept Zaire with many thinking Mobutu would soon be blown away, that at one time the National Sovereign Conference nearly wrested all executive power from the despotic ruler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unlike Kaunda of Zambia, Ngueso of Congo, General Karekou of Benin or the de Klerk of South Africa, Mobutu had no real intention of quitting. He only played along to buy time. Drawing from his immense personal fortune, Mobutu withdrew from the trouble-torn Kinshasa, sometime living in his houseboat on the River Zaire but mostly in his palace at Gbadolite, hundreds of miles from the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elite Presidential Guard took control of security and a special unit began to implement a campaign of terror that saw newspaper offices fire bombed and the homes of opposition members attacked with rockets. There was even an attempt to kill the Catholic Archbishop of Kinshasa area, Mosengwo Pasinya, Speaker of the Transition Parliament that succeeded the national conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its annual report in 1994, the Zairean Association for Defense of Human Rights said 60 per cent of the 152 murder or summary execution cases it had recorded were committed by soldiers operating with impunity. The press has also regularly reported on hold-ups, roadside extortions, kidnappings, robberies and rapes committed by &quot;bandits in uniform, throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu in the meantime continued to cleverly play off one group against another within the Transition Parliament. Some were simply bought off. The popular and widely accepted Tshiskedi found his premiership taken over by Birindwa. Birindwa in turn gave way to Kengo wa Dondo, the incumbent Prime Minister and Mobutu's confidant who seems to enjoy the &quot;enthusiastic support&quot; of donor nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a vain attempt to coax opposition politicians who want to ouster him, Dondo on July 22 reshuffled the Cabinet in a move to create &quot;a genuine government of national unity&quot;. However, the opposition which holds the majority in the interim parliament refused to take part in Kengo's consultations to form a new government. It is doubtful opposition figures included in the new cabinet will &quot;bite the bait&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today a large number of Zaire's 40 million strong population feel deeply betrayed as the transition period that initially looked so promising has passed &quot;quietly like a village wedding&quot;, observers have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zaireans are a courageous people, and Mobutu's attempt to foster a regional policy by working one tribe against another as a survival gimmick has not taken root. Spates of ethnic cleansing have died down, observers further say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, grassroots organisations for the purpose of &quot;radical civic education&quot; have sprung up with Catholic church parishes playing a critical role in the awareness campaigns. The campaigns are, however, largely initiated by lay people according to some sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amos Group of Kinshasa, is one such group. The group has organised a number of popular demonstrations in Kinshasa. It regularly encourages members to &quot;challenge fear&quot; and to be actively involved in pro-democracy work and initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyday the people have to be prepared to challenge fear. It is the only way to ensure that true freedom will reign one day,&quot; a spokesman of the group said. The people are taught that having lost everything under the dictatorship of Mobutu, &quot;they should no longer be afraid of losing their jobs or afraid to say 'No' to unjust laws and fraudulent reforms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members, who like their membership in the church, try to shun tribal loyalties are further taught to search their hearts and look to solutions and ways of getting rid of the dictatorship. &quot;Its going to be costly but its ones duty. Educate yourself for democracy and be prepared to assume positions of leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amos Group also reminds the people that many died to rid the country of the notorious Belgian colonisers and that &quot;the challenges of those says must challenge us to similar sacrifices today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many more similar groups such as Groupe Jeremie in Bukavu which is actively involved in sensitising the people in the manner of Groupe Amos.  Their intention is not to take the democratisation initiative away from political leaders, but to &quot;support the process from bottom-up&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barely two months since the ruling military junta lifted the ban on political activities in an apparent first move to return Nigeria to civilian rule, recent secret trials and sentencing of alleged coup plotters to long jail terms, crackdown on human rights activists and journalists and the harassing of pro-democracy agitators has cast a shadow over &quot;any meaningful&quot; democratisation programme in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by a Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new era dawns on Nigeria, declared the Champion. But for the A.M. News, another independent daily, the Nigerian strongman General Sani Abacha had merely left people in suspense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many critics, among them opposition politicians and pro-democracy activists, seem to share the later view. Bani Fawehinmi, a leading activist and lawyer, said Abacha was trying to set up a political dummy which Nigerians are not prepared to accept.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is pathologically committed to dictatorship because it is only under dictatorship that Abacha can function,&quot; Fawehinmi said. But despite the doubts expressed by most politicians and activists, a few other media groups joined the Champion to welcome the lifting of the ban on political activity.  Abacha's military junta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha announced the immediate lifting of the ban he imposed when he came to power in November 1993, at a ceremony in the federal capital, Abuja, to receive the &quot;controversial text&quot; of a draft new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the ceremony on June 27, Abacha said a new National Electoral Commission (NEC) would be set up to organise civilian elections. He promised to give details regarding plans to give up power to a democratically elected government during his traditional independence day speech in October. The general who gave no further details, however, warned politicians to beware of irresponsible activities that could threaten national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many critics doubted the sincerity of the announcement and could not take it on its face value. Michael Adenkunle Ajasin, one of the founders of the opposition National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) expressed disappointment that Abacha did not use the occasion to free detained politicians, notably the presumed winner of the June 1993 presidential elections, millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NADECO, the main group backing Abiola is composed of prominent politicians, senior retired military officers and pro-democracy activists drawn largely from the Yoruba ethnic group in south-western Nigeria. The group wants Abacha to hand over power to Abiola, also a Yoruba, to form and head a government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the junta is still holding the ailing Abiola, who faces treason charges for declaring himself winner of the presidential poll in June 1994 on the first anniversary of the cancelled elections. The military cancelled the elections when it became evident Abiola was winning. A former head of state and an international figure, General Olusegun Obasanjo, is also being held and his name has featured among the more than 40 people tried secretly for allegedly plotting to overthrow Abacha's junta in March this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has been ruled by military regimes for all but 10 years since it achieved independence from British colonial rule on October 1, 1960. Abacha, described by opponents as a hardline anti-democrat, took over power after the military refused to publish the results of June 1993 elections and set up instead a short-lived hand-picked civilian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting that his aim was the ultimate restoration of &quot;true&quot; democracy in Nigeria and an end to corruption, Abacha closed down all the country's democratic institutions, arrested opposition leaders and banned a series of hostile newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time he formed a Constitutional Conference, dubbed &quot;a charade&quot; by opponents, which he said would map out the future political government of Nigeria. The Conference officially wound up its work on June 27, and presented a report to the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), the top military body headed by Abacha. The PRC is expected to ratify the new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But opponents of the PRC have already dismissed, as undemocratic, the new constitutional proposals, notably the provision for a rotating presidency between the mainly Muslim north and the largely Christian south.  Pro-democracy and human rights groups spurned the Conference, as a farce and a manoeuvre aimed at keeping the military in power. The Conference was eight months behind schedule with its report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the June 27 announcement, Abacha was at pains to show that he was still on the track to hand over power to civilians. But his actions have remained &quot;diametrically opposed&quot; to the supposed intent of the Conference and in particular, plans for the military to give up power, observers have noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the announcement, Abacha ordered the rounding up of more than 50 opposition leaders and human rights activists to forestall any unrest that could result from the arrest, secret trial and sentencing of the alleged coup plotters. The &quot;plotters&quot; include Generals Obasanjo and his former deputy Yar' Adua, two most respected former Nigerian military leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those arrested also include Chief Michael Adenkunle Ajasin, 86, of NADECO who was picked up at his home in Owo, along with scores of others attending a meeting of the &quot;Afenifere&quot;, a group inside NADECO. Chief Ajasin is one of the architects of Nigeria's independence and a former civilian governor of the south-western state of Ondo, while the &quot;Afenifere&quot; group to which he belongs is the core group inside NADECO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several labour activists and opposition members, including ex-civilian governor Chief Cornelius Adebayo, and other leading NADECO members were also taken in at Ilorin, the capital of the central Kwara state, allegedly in connection with a bomb blast a day earlier in the city stadium during the official launching of a government project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers saw the clampdown on the opposition, as part of a bid by an apparently panicky government to forestall any form of demonstration as the second anniversary of the June 1993 presidential election drew near. However, the anniversary passed quietly without major incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Abacha has turned his wrath on journalists, forcing a number of them to go into hiding. Their fear was heightened by reports, at the beginning of this month, that a number of journalists had been arrested and convicted of sedition over stories that criticised the ruling military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this crackdown combined with total disregard for international outcry against the trials and calls for the pardoning of the alleged coup plotters,that has prompted many Nigerians to fear their country was at &quot;the crossroads of a military dictatorship that could eventually destroy the country's international image beyond repair. Most doubt than any democratisation process can commence at all when &quot;the ground is so unlevel&quot; except for those willing to work in cahoot with the military.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabriel Roric Jur, a black African southern Sudanese and a bishop of the Province of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan (ECS) doubles as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in the almost exclusively Arab- Muslim government headed by Lt. General Omar Hassan El-Bashir. Since 1986 Roric, who is Bishop of Rumbek Diocese in the South, has lived in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, following the destruction of Rumbek in fighting between government troops and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Bishop Roric was interviewed by Santino Makur Kot in early August in Nairobi, Kenya where he was attending a senior meeting of the ECS House of Bishops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. As an African Christian cleric from the south what prompted you to serve in a government that discriminates against southerners because of their faith and colour? A. First of all, as a Christian, I am a strong believer in coexistence and tolerance. I also draw inspiration from the story of Prophet Daniel during the Babylonian Captivity. Daniel did his best to save his people from many difficulties especially persecution. There are many other examples in the Old Testament which relate to such situations. I also believe in non-violence. My mission is to put the message of reconciliation to the Government and opposition groups with a view to normalising the existing situation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. How did you join the Islamic Government?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Before my appointment to the Cabinet, I served in 1988 as a member of the Council for Mercy, a Christian-Muslim group that was set up to work for peace through dialogue. My church nominated me to the Council. I saw my appointment as another window which God had opened for the church's voice to be heard beyond and within the Islamic Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. But in spite of your presence in the government the war has dragged on and your government continues to be accused of a policy of Islamisation and annihilation of your fellow southerners?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Firstly the conflict in Sudan is not religious. In my opinion it is a political war, because the rights of the southern Sudanese people are not granted. I stand for the political rights of all people, which in the case of South-Sudan have not been addressed since Sudan's independence in 1956, when the north and the south which are religiously and racially diverse merged.  The present government inherited the war from past regimes. The war has raged since 1955 except for 11 years between 1972 and 1983 when a peace pact was brokered between the two regions. The then President Gafer Numeiry abrogated the peace agreement of 1972, among other things by introducing Islamic Law, which particularly annoyed southern Christians. This has tended to give the war a religious dimension that has overshadowed its origins that are rooted in the demand for political rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. But why does the present government still maintain Sharia Law?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. The introduction of Sharia Islamic Law complicated an otherwise simple political problem. The political problem needed a political solution at the time of Sudan's independence, but this was not done. Issues of political and civic rights for the people of southern Sudan were not addressed. Southerners include people such as Nuba, Ingessira and others who administratively and geographically are presently not in the south. The issue is now complicated and needs to be handled cautiously, so that the number of radicals on either side does not increase. My point is that the duty of all Sudanese, including those in the Government and the SPLA, is to sit together and work for peace and reconciliation before the situation gets worse. We need to sit and discuss alone as Sudanese without interference from outside. On October 4, 1994 the Government passed a Provisional Order requiring church-related agencies to register as societies or Non-Governmental Organisation (NGOs) under the Societies Act of 1957.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. What is your opinion of this order which many churches have criticised?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. It is true this order has caused controversy between the Church and the Government. As instruments of the church these agencies are part and parcel of church establishments and their role should not be confused with the normal work of the church. The Government wishes to give legal entity to these agencies to enable them have rights and privileges for humanitarian work. The churches themselves are not required to register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. What would you consider as major achievements during your tenure in the Cabinet? A. Against a background of religious, cultural and racial diversity, I consider myself a cooling system. I facilitated the visit of Pope John Paul II to Sudan in February 1993. I also facilitated the visit of the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1994. The Archbishop is set to return to Sudan in the near future. I have also laboured for the cancellation of the Missionary Act which deprived Christians of their freedom of worship and denied them access to land for church buildings. I consider myself a symbol of unity between the north and south and between Christians and Muslims</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Nernlor Grudah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest peace accord on Liberia is most significant and extraordinary not because all the warring factions were signatories but because Nigeria, the main power player, put its thumb on the pact, thereby unlocking the long-drawn process. Although nominal in a sense, there are reasons to believe that the latest peace accord in Liberia is very likely to stick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberians who welcomed the August accord with guarded optimism did so out of disillusionment and perhaps, out of ignorance. They are disillusioned because 12 previous accords have largely been broken, and ignorant of the high-class propaganda that has made a scapegoat of the warlords and kept the bloody conflict going for more than five years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Propaganda is capable of shaping, transforming and above all, misleading international opinion, and that is what has happened in the Liberian civil war. Under the latest agreement, signed in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, on August 20, a cease-fire was expected to come into force on August 26 and a six-member transitional state council to be set up within two weeks of the signing. Democratic elections are to be held within one year following disarmament and demobilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brokered by Nigeria and Ghana, which holds the chairmanship of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the agreement was signed by all seven warring factions. They include the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), Ulimo-K, Ulimo-J, Liberia Peace Council (LPC), Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), Lofa Defence Force (LDF), and NPFL-Central Revolutionary Council (NPFL-CRC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most baffling to many Liberians, was the unanimous endorsement of a less known university professor, Wilton Sankawulo, as chairman of the new state council. He replaces the aging Chief Tamba Tailor (in his 90s) who has been presented as candidate. However, the Chief will remain a member of the council as a representative of traditional leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other members are Charles Taylor of NPFL, Alhaji Kromah of the United Liberation Movement-K (Ulimo-K), George Boley of LPC, who represents a coalition of the other factions including his, and Oscar Quiah of the Liberian National Conference, representing the civilians. The signing, overseen by ECOWAS Chairman, President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, and Nigeria's military strongman, Sani Abacha, was also witnessed by representatives of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and United Nations, which has an observer mission in Liberia. This follows Abacha's decision to break with the path taken by his predecessor, Ibrahim Babangida, and to arrange a high-profile reconciliation visit of Nigeria's erstwhile bitter foe in the conflict, Charles Taylor, to Abuja in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having made the visit, his first in five years, Taylor has since made a couple of other trips to Nigeria, culminating in the signing of the accord.  Observers see this as part of Abacha's efforts to patch up his government's battered international image because of human rights abuses and lack of commitment to return the country to democratic rule. Analysts advance that the reason why this accord will hold is that all the warring factions signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is not the first time all factions have signed a peace accord to end the civil war that has claimed more than 150,000 lives, destroyed the economy and infrastructure of Liberia and displaced half the population of nearly 3 million. The Cotonou Accord signed in Benin, in July, 1993, was by all three main factions at the time, the NPFL, ULIMO and the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) led by Dr. Amos Sawyer, which controlled the ramp AFL. It followed 10 days of intensive negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland. But that collapsed soon afterwards, because during the process, the Nigerian-led ECOWAS Monitoring Group, ECOMOG, was propping up a new faction, LPC, at the time, which refused to abide by the accord. And to make matters worse, another Nigerian-sponsored faction, Ulimo, split into two over the seating of the present transitional state council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been established by independent bodies like the UN and human rights groups that Nigeria is responsible for the heating up of all the other splinter armed groups to fight against the NPFL. Except for the NPFL-CRC led by former Taylor's Defence Minister, Tom Woewiyu, the rest of the factions are all splinter groups from the AFL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one stage, Nigeria even tried to allegedly sponsor another faction in Nimba county, the Nimba Redemption Council (NRC) - an area which is a NPFL stronghold. But that group soon fizzled out and disappeared from the scene as it lacked operation base and support among Liberian refugees in both Ivory Coast and Guinea. That would have meant brother against brother, and husband against wife (from the same ethnic groups), for it was in Nimba county that some of the most gruesome killings under the military tyranny of the late Samuel Doe took place, including the burying alive of women and children.  Based on the foregoing, one can conclude that Nigeria holds the key to ending the war in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Factions which have no popular support among the population rely on the Nigerian military presence to demand a stake in any administration. The latest developments in the Liberian crisis have also apparently been precipitated by a UN threat to withdraw its mission, UNOMIL, if the factions did not make progress to end the stalemate, disarm and set a date for general elections. Such withdrawal was expected to be effected by September 15 this year if all or some of the conditions were not met, when a UN mandate is expected to expire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is extremely difficult to justify the continuation of manpower tied to disarmament when there is no disarmament going on,&quot; UN Special Envoy to Liberia, Anthony Nyakyi, told journalists. By softening its stand, Nigeria appears to have come to terms with realities on the ground in Liberia. But the move comes too little and too late when irreparable damage has already been done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPFL remains the most representative group in the conflict and still wields widespread support among the population, although some may not be fans of its leadership. Yet it has been the arch-foe of the Nigerian-led ECOMOG, which has thrown everything into battle, unsuccessfully, to crush it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Liberians are wary of a Charles Taylor presidency for fear of his becoming another Doe, given that he (Taylor) is already alleged to have masterminded the assassination of key politicians and potential rivals, mostly from Nimba county, including Jackson Doe, David Duanyan and Moses Duopu, to name but a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically though, Taylor is not from the region, he draws the bulk of his NPFL fighters from there. The reason for enormous NPFL support is simple. All the other factions, except NPFL-CRC, are no different from the AFL; in fact, they are one and the same. Real lasting peace will come to Liberia when all foreign forces have completely withdrawn from the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Wafula John</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African indigenous churches were explained away as an &quot;overnight fad&quot; when they first emerged in Sierra Leone around 1819. This contemptuous portrayal did not, however, stop them from flourishing, sometimes as a direct counteraction to colonial administration. But decades since the demise of colonialism indigenous churches, also referred to as African Independent Churches (AICs) now estimated at 9000 with millions of followers, are a force to reckon with. Our writer explores some of the things that make AICs trick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christ saves and comforts all, but when Raymond Mukilwa, 45, first &quot;embraced the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; more distress gripped him.  What shall I do with my two wives? He wondered. Suppose he separated from one of them, as the wisdom of his church prevailed upon him, what would become of the divorced wife and her children? Whatever he did, he would always have to live with the stigma of having been polygamous. He would never rise to any position of responsibility in his church, even if he deserved it. And he, like his second wife, would never go to Communion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A haunted Mukilwa brought his distress to Sinaida Dorcas Mary Akatsa, fondly referred to as &quot;mama&quot; or &quot;the prophetess&quot;. Akatsa, a former domestic servant, is the founder of the Jerusalem Church of Christ (JCC) situated in the sprawling Kawangware area, a poor suburb of Nairobi. The prophetess boasts of over 30,000 adherents. Prophetess Akatsa's church put to rest Mukilwa's anxieties without much fuss. He was allowed to keep his two wives.  But he would be excommunicated if he added another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The JCC is one of the many African Independent Churches (AICs) that are steadily gaining popularity in sub-Saharan Africa partly because of their ability to reconcile uniquely African experiences. In earlier years, these churches were seen as a reaction against colonialism. But when they continued to flourish and even mushroom in modern times society, began to look at them more seriously. A leading African scholar, Rev. Professor John S. Mbiti, once described AICs as &quot;a messy soup&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today there are about 9,000 AICs with millions of followers estimated at 15 per cent of Africa's total Christian population. But according to some sources these estimates are too conservative since the movements are growing faster than scholars are studying them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is also reluctance to acknowledge their phenomenal growth,&quot; says Jack O. Nandi, a scholar in African indigenous religious movements and a lecturer in religion at Maseno University in Kenya. In South Africa, for example, statistics show that only 9 per cent Christians were members of indigenous churches by 1950. This figure rose to 18 per cent in 1960, 29.3 per cent in 1980 and was estimated at about 35 per cent in 1990. The World Christian Encyclopedia estimates that in the mid 80s Zaire had 4,777,500 indigenous church adherents who were expected to increase to 8,848,500 by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts now agree there must be another explanation for the constant drift of believers from the mainstream or &quot;mission planted churches&quot; to the AICs.  Apart from polygamy which many accept, a majority of these churches have built a sense of brotherhood among members not unlike the traditional extended family system or communalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many AICs also embrace and enthusiastically encourage a lively presence of the Holy Spirit and guardian angels in a manner similar to the role of, and respect traditional society paid to ancestors. Also the unique baptism, confirmation and other rituals, in some cases resembling the customary initiation ceremonies of some ethnic groups in the successive age groups, have attracted many believers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Africa Church of the Holy Spirit for instance, urge the faithful to style their worship on experiences drawn from their African traditions as long as they confirm to, or do not violate fundamental Biblical teachings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand mainstream churches have been accused of patronage, lack of understanding of the African reality, and a blind onslaught on traditional customs and practices. Where they are recognised such as the last funeral rights (inheritance) of the Baganda of Uganda, rather than fuse tradition with what is good from Christianity, the opposite appears to be the case. The church tends to take over the tradition and seek to fuse Christianity with what is good or appropriate from the tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prophesy and healing are the other major attractions of indigenous churches. The fact that their leaders lay claim to prophesy and healing is a great boon that has attracted not only Africans, but also people of different socio-cultural backgrounds including a few Asians and some Europeans. This aspect in a way conforms with the &quot;perversive religiosity&quot; of the African people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing on African spirituality, Father Renato Kizito, a well known Italian priest cum-journalist, asserts that matters that affect people such as health are fundamental concerns, that make healing a critical issue. Yet these dimensions, he writes, &quot;have been put aside by a Western spirituality preoccupied - sometimes one could say obsessed - with moral and sexual behaviour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Kizito further asserts that AICs take the spiritual and physical well-being of their adherents extremely seriously. &quot;It can be said that their very life and worship revolve around healing, visions, dreams and the overcoming of evil forces.&quot; On a continent where spirits both good and evil are a crucial component of traditional beliefs, this aspect undoubtedly appeals to many ordinary African worshippers especially when not &quot;schooled&quot; in the Western sense. However, the most binding cord of these churches is often the charisma - power to inspire devotion and enthusiasm - which their leaders often exude. This charisma is often bolstered by the often mysterious aura of their founders and leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sinaida Mary Akatsa, for example, has a very mysterious childhood tale.  Born through a cesarean birth two months pre-maturely, she came three hours after her mother had been pronounced dead. The infant Akatsa is said to have &quot;outwitted&quot; innumerable attempts at her life. Among these were poisoning, bewitching and even abandonment in a thicket for three days and nights. The worst had yet to happen. In March 1983 &quot;mummy&quot; was poisoned, &quot;died for three days and three nights&quot;, and was ordered out of heaven to come back and &quot;lead lost souls&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skeptics may be sobered by the fact that by 1993, &quot;mama&quot; Akatsa's Jerusalem Church of Christ had 11,222 registered members and over 20,000 unregistered followers in four branches in Kenya. The church boasts of a following of between 30,000 and 40,000 members countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attraction of AICs also include their fusing of indigenous elements with their worship. Worshippers are perennially active throughout a worship service, with choral singing, dancing, hand clapping and even ululations.  Often, the songs, which carry rich African tones and beats, are accompanied by such indigenous instruments as the kayamba, the horn and jingles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Julius Murikwa of Daystar University based in Nairobi, concedes that the style of preaching in indigenous churches&quot; is yet another of their attractions. The worship is &quot;active, interactive and participatory,&quot; with the preacher and congregation all taking part. It is not unusual for congregations to plunge in collective hymns, adoration, prayers and communal castigation of sin and Satan. Said Prof. Murikwa: &quot;Church services are not seen as an hourly rite where congregants listen to some sermon, absolve themselves of sin and leave. It is a communal activity of renewal which often lasts for six hours or more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more, AICs are now attempting to solve their adherent's temporal needs through a very strong bond of a mutually beneficial brotherhood among the faithful. In an African milieu where even manual jobs continuously shrink, it is no wonder that the young flock to churches like &quot;prophetess&quot; Akatsa's. In infusing this African &quot;holistic&quot; view of worship - that religion should serve the total person for spiritual and temporal nourishment - indigenous churches have greatly endeared themselves to &quot;the disoriented urban immigrant&quot;, says Prof. Murikwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps what is most puzzling is the immense power and influence which female leaders often wield in these churches contrary to male dominance in mainstream churches. The churches confer status and prominence to women, often building some into formidable prophetesses who, if not checked, can easily build personal cults. Father Kizito states that these prophetesses spring up especially when the male leadership fails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are the last resort, the last voice or possibility of protest, even violent protest, left to the poor,&quot; he concludes. Some indigenous churches' prophetesses who left an indelible mark on the African continent include prophetess Leshina of Zambia, Lakwena of Uganda and Mother Jane Bloomer of Freetown, just to name a few. Scholars say that the increasing drift of women to independent churches is also due to barrenness, delay in conception, and domestic difficulties. Many indigenous churches respond to these problems through deliberate and open healing and prayer sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps where indigenous churches score a hat-trick is their handling of the dead and the deceased. Most African communities loathe burial in communal cemeteries with the unknown. Also responsibility to the dead and the deceased is communal. So is the case in many African indigenous churches. Often the churches or members, communally meet all funeral expenses including the transportation of both corpses and mourners among other requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same is true of weddings, big hospital bills and other responsibilities that an individual, family or friends alone may not afford. One adherent put it plainly: &quot;My church is my insurance policy to a decent burial.&quot; With the growing destitution, particularly in Africa's expanding cities, many people may continue to seek supportive brotherhood and comfort in an African independent church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Professor Murikwa notes, most indigenous church leaders have very little formal education if at all. Some AICs leaders in fact, understand Bible teachings only superficially, and hence do a great disservice to their flock by misinterpreting the Holy Scriptures. &quot;Therefore there is need for Christian institutions of missiology as well as mainstream churches, to reach out to these leaders to help train them,&quot; recommends Murikwa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VATICAN CITY (APS) August 28 - As Christians, particularly Catholics in Africa look forward to the eleventh pastoral visit to Africa by Pope Paul II mid-September, the Holy See's press office has released the Pontiff's detailed itinerary. A recent dispatch from the Vatican says the Pontiff will spend two days (September 14-16) in Yaounde, Cameroon, another two in South Africa, (September 16-18), where he will travel between Johannesburg and Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 18 he is scheduled to leave Johannesburg for Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, where he is expected to stay until September 20 when he returns to the Vatican. During his visit to Africa, the Pope intends to hold concluding celebrations of the Special Synod for Africa and Madagascar, whose working sessions were held in Rome from April 10 to May 8, 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlights of the journey include celebrations of Mass and sessions of the Assembly of the Special Synod for Africa in the countries covered by the Pontiff's visit. According to the media dispatch, the visit to South Africa will be the first Papal visit to the country, while Cameroon's will be his second, having been there in 1985. Kenya will be hosting the current head of the Catholic Church for the third time as he visited the country on two previous occasions, 1980 and 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same press release, the Holy See says, the Pope will be accompanied by, among others three presidents-delegate of the African Synod, Cardinals-Francis Arinze of Nigeria; Christian Tumi of Cameroon; Paulos Tzadua of Ethiopia; Hyacinth Thiandoum of Senegal and the Secretary-General of the Synod of bishops, Jan Schotte. The Vatican dispatch says the Pope's September pastoral visit to Africa will bring to 37 the number of African countries he has so far visited, since he was enthroned as the head of the universal Roman Catholic church in 1978.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANGOCHI-MALAWI (APS) August 28 - Internal hostilities, wars and conflicts that continue to affect some African communities are incompatible with development and therefore African leaders should work towards eradicating them, a group of Catholic bishops from the East and Central African regions has cautioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clergy, drawn from Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea, and meeting here under the Catholic church's regional body of the Association of Episcopal Conferences of Eastern Africa (AMECEA) between August 6 and 20, stressed that civil strife has made development among certain communities impossible. Exemplifying Sudan and Somalia, the bishops said events in those countries have led to the uprooting of thousands of people from their homes and resulted in terrible loss of human life and property.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the role of women in development, the Catholic clergy noted that many women are bearing burdens of responsibility that are beyond their capacity, stressing that without the contribution of women, social and economic life in our nations would come to a standstill. The contribution of women needs to be recognised and economically rewarded, the bishops further stressed. They also expressed support for delegates to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China and acknowledged the struggle for their (women's) rightful place in society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic clergy, who addressed various issues pertaining to the social, economic, political and religious needs of the African people, underscored the need to make the Church central in the life of the African people. &quot;If the Church is to become the family of God in Africa, we all, clergy, religious and the laity have to learn to sit together, to look together at our situation, to listen to each other, to plan a common project and feel all responsible for realising it,&quot; stated the bishops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a Rwandese catholic bishop, invited to attend the AMECEA assembly, strongly defended his church against claims that the latter was involved in the genocide that took place in the Central African country between April and July 1994. &quot;The Catholic church is falsely accused of having a share of responsibility in the Rwandese tragedy. In fact, it is the craving for power that has led to this tragedy, while the church was incapable of defending even its own members,&quot; noted Bishop Wenceslas Kalibushi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandese clergy lamented that &quot;the numerous criticisms abusively thrown at the church in Rwanda by the national and international media do not make the moral recovery of our people any easier.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAO TOME (APS) August 28 - Soldiers who ousted Sao Tome and Principe's first democratically elected President Miguel Trovoada mid-August have handed back power under an amnesty deal worked out by Angolan Foreign Minister Nenancio de Moura. The coup leaders, who struck early on August 15 and said they had ousted President Trovoada, handed back power a week later on August 22 after they failed to win support from their countrymen and women at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ousted president resumed possession of his offices at midday on August 22 and approved an amnesty law protecting the coup leaders, which had been voted in by the national assembly a day earlier. The same day, the Sao Tome cabinet held an extraordinary meeting presided over by Prime Minister Carlos Graca, a move that indicated that a ministerial reshuffle could be in the offing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a further measure to restore order to the impoverished West African nation, one of the poorest in the world, foreign ministers from Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, as well as Sao Tome and Principe, were expected to attend a summit in Sao Tome in the coming days to discuss the country's economic, political and social situation, a source close to the Angolan Foreign Minister said. Earlier, De Moura, who helped to negotiate an end to the crisis, went on the island republic's national radio to announce that civilian rule had been restored in this country, declaring: &quot;Thanks to understanding, good sense and a spirit of patriotism shown by all sides, it has been possible to normalise political life in Sao Tome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Moura said a memorandum had been signed between the coup leaders and the civilian authorities calling for a series of measures including a restructuring of the military, but with Trovoada remaining as commander in chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources in the army, the coup leaders agreed to sign the amnesty document after getting assurance that they would neither be prosecuted, tried nor disciplined. The mutineers also obtained satisfaction in a dispute over the make-up of the presidential guard, after they were assured that the personal guard of the president would continue to be trained by officers from Sao Tome and Principe and not by foreign soldiers as the president had wanted. The signatories were coup leader Sub-Lieutenant Quintas de Almeida and the Speaker of the National Assembly, Francisco Fortunato Pires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accord came only a few hours after the National Assembly unanimously voted to amnesty those involved in the coup, thus meeting the main condition set by the soldiers before they would relinquish power. Trovoada, who was elected president in the first democratic elections since independence, was arrested and overthrown at dawn on August 15 in a bloodless coup organised by a group of officers who said they wanted to &quot;restore order&quot; to the island republic, which won independence from Portugal in 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the coup failed to win general support here or abroad, with numerous countries condemning the putsch and suspending aid desperately needed in a destitute nation where, for example, teachers earn only dollars 10 a month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FREETOWN (APS) August 28 - Delegates to Sierra Leone's National Consultative Conference voted on August 17 to postpone general elections in the West African country from December to February 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many delegates had during the three-day meeting voiced support for the original date to be maintained, but the chairman of the Interim National Electoral Commission (INEC) chairman James Jonah, a former UN under secretary-general, proposed the deferment of the elections until March 1996.  According to Jonah, the need to postpone the elections arose out of lack of funds for the poll, whose cost was estimated at US dollars 17 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is also to give time for political parties to canvass and also for the National Committee for Democracy (a UN-sponsored group) to increase their civic voter education,&quot; Jonah said after the conference closed. But the delegates voiced open opposition against Sierra Leonean rebels denouncing the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of renegade Sierra Leone army officer, Corporal Foday Sankoh for not taking part in the conference. They also called on the military government to provide security and design a security plan of action before the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling military junta, of Captain Valentine Strasser, which had the responsibility to confirm the conference's proposals, has since welcomed the proposals and is now expected to endorse the conference's proposals. But news of the postponement was greeted with mixed feelings, especially from 10 out of the 17 political parties expected to take part in the coming polls. One angry politician hit out: &quot;What is the need for the postponement? The election was one thing that could have ended the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But diplomats here, mainly from western Europe, said the postponement was necessary and they even cast doubts on the possibility of holding the elections by February. When the conference opened, only six delegates out of 70 had opted for a change of the polls date. Before the closure of the conference, Major Karefa Kargbo, the defence spokesman and a member of the military junta, had told the conference that the military government did not want to take a position on the timing of the vote, saying: &quot;We are looking up to delegates to reach a consensus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 40 per cent of Sierra Leone's 4.5 million population have been displaced by the four-year-old civil war, and despite an invitation to attend, the RUF failed to turn up. The delegates included representatives of student organisations, universities, trade unions, women's organisations, traditional chiefs and representatives of Sierra Leonean refugees currently living in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Strasser's government had promised to hand over to an elected administration in early 1996 following elections at the end of this year, but many observers felt the only form of election that could be organised would be a highly modified form of proportional representation due to the very high number of Sierra Leoneans forced to live outside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days of registration of political parties ended on August 14 with 17 provisionally registered, among them the All People's Congress (APC), the one-time sole party which was overthrown by junior officers in the April 29, 1992 coup that brought Captain Strasser's National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) to power. The war has claimed over 10,000 lives, according to official statistics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA (APS) August 28 - The capture of the southern Sudanese border town of Kaya by Sudanese troops and a new Ugandan rebel movement, the West Nile Bank Front, has increased tension between Uganda and Sudan. Kaya was previously a stronghold of the Garang faction (mainstream) of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, SPLA. The guerrillas of the SPLA fled Kaya which was taken virtually without a fight on August 12.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda's Minister of State for Defence, Amama Mbabazi told the State newspaper New Vision that there was a possibility that the capture of Kaya by Sudanese troops and the West Nile Bank Front &quot;was intended to create a platform from where the Sudan government may aid the rebel to disrupt the peace in Uganda.&quot; The West Nile Bank Front comprises former soldiers who served in the Idi Amin regime. Most members are believed to be from West Nile area. They are commanded by a one time Cabinet Minister in the Amin period, Juma Oris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda has on a number of occasions over the past year accused Sudan of sponsoring the rebels to destabilise Uganda. These accusations were directed mainly against Joseph Kony's Lords Resistance Army (LRA) which in the past engaged in acts of banditry, killings and kidnappings, mainly in Kitgum District in northern Uganda. However the LRA troops have recently been kitted in new Sudan Army uniforms and carry a heavier range of weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 23 this year following the massacre of 200 villagers in Kitgum District near the Sudan border, Uganda angrily severed diplomatic relations with Sudan and warned that it reserved the right to attack their bases inside Sudan in future. In turn Sudan accused Uganda of supporting the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspicions continued despite a meeting between Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni and President El Bashir of Sudan aimed at reconciling the two countries. The meeting, last May in Malawi was at the behest of the Malawian leader, Bakili Muluzi. Already there are reports that Ugandans are fleeing Kobiko village on the border, following persistent aerial bombing and artillery shelling by Sudanese troops and the new rebel group now in Kaya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Uganda's Defence Ministry has confirmed that government troops mid-August killed Major Oryem Lagwaramoi second in Command to Joseph Kony.  Thirteen rebels of the Lords Resistance Army also died during the pitched battle north west of Kitgum town at Obolokome. The rebels are believed to have entered Uganda from Sudan about August 15. They roamed and terrorised villagers in Palabek, Padibe, Ocettoke, Lemo Lugwar, and other villages in Kitgum before being confronted by Uganda's National Resistance Army (NRA) troops. The death of their deputy commander is believed to be a major blow to the Lords Resistance Army who are generally described as &quot;Christian fundamentalist forces&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, they carry out regular atrocities in areas that they attack and are hated by their own Acoli people. Their Commander, Joseph Kony is believed to have been injured during a rebel incursion into Uganda early this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) August 28 - Scholars meeting here recently have challenged fellow experts in Africa and elsewhere in the world to work hand-in-hand with their governments to help eradicate poverty among the affected communities.  During the Fourth World Conference of the World Future Studies Federation (WFSF) held in the Kenyan capital recently, scholars drawn from all over the world were also urged to make sure that their research work was matched with implementation. The 250 delegates to the world conference, the first to have been held on the African soil, expressed concern that in some cases, the amount of work that goes into research work was not matched with similar effort when it came to implementation. As a result, we end up having too much knowledge on paper and little and sometimes none on the practical level, the delegates, who were drawn from diversified disciplines, among them theologians, observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that poverty was on the increase among many communities in the world over, the scholars pointed out that &quot;it would be naive to abdicate that responsibility to governments&quot;. The scholars concern over poverty and its effects among the affected communities comes in the wake of reports indicating that the number of poor people is growing in the world over and particularly in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in its July report on the food situation in Africa, expressed concern that an estimated 23 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are faced with starvation as food aid declines. According to the FAO report, the largest concentration of these vulnerable populations is in Southern Africa (10 million), followed by Eastern Africa (9 million), Western Africa (3 million) and Central Africa (one million). &quot;Widespread drought has seriously undermined production in southern Africa, while persistent civil strife and security problems in some countries continue to limit farming and distribution activities,&quot; the FAO report points out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports on deteriorating famine, drought and civil strife in Africa will definitely increase poverty among communities. That is why, we, scholars, among others, should get involved towards its poverty eradication, observed South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, while delivering his key-note address at the conference. The South African clergy who is the current president of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), further urged African nations to find a lasting solution to the many problems facing the continent as a first step towards social and economic reforms. The continent's survival is threatened by all manner of social, economic and political ills and can only sustain itself if it reassesses the past with the intention of starting a new chapter, Archbishop Tutu emphasised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Tutu who addressed the conference on &quot;Accountability and Poverty in Africa&quot;, challenged Africa to make efforts to stand on its own feet as the continent is no longer a priority to the West, which he said, prefers to support the former Eastern bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, a two-day meeting, held in the Uganda capital, Kampala on the management of Science and Technology for development in Africa decried Africa's falling standards as far as self-sufficiency in food is concerned. The forum attended by some 500 delegates, among them five African Heads of State representing Zimbabwe, Uganda, Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique lamented that ineffective application of improved production technology linked to ineffective pricing and marketing and high rates of population growth had resulted in declining per capita food production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late July meeting was attended by Presidents of Zimbabwe, Uganda, Botswana, Malawi, and Mozambique. They were among the estimated 500 delegates at the two-day meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) August 28 - Bishops of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan (ECS) have appealed to the government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) to work relentlessly towards achieving honourable peace to save their people from the long-standing civil war which continues to drain human and material resources from the Sudan. Saying that they believed Sudanese are &quot;naturally peace-loving&quot; people, the bishops asked Lt. General Omar Hassan Ahmed El-Bashir, leader of the Sudanese junta and the SPLM and its army, the SPLA, to disassociate themselves from hostilities, start peace talks &quot;anywhere on earth acceptable&quot; and allow food to reach starving people in the regions they each control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter addressed to Bashir but intended for and sent to both the Sudanese President and John Garang, head of SPLM and commander of SPLA, the bishops said that &quot;freedom of evangelisation and free movement of bishops&quot; ought to be facilitated throughout the country. The letter signed by all the 20 bishops of the ECS, was issued at the end of a week-long meeting here.  Among the bishops at the August 4-12 meeting was Gabriel Roric, Bishop of Rumbeki in the south, who is also Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in Bashir's cabinet. Bishop Roric has lived in Khartoum since 1986 when Rumbeki was destroyed by fighting between SPLA fighters and government troops. He was appointed Minister in August 1992. In another development, Hassan Al-Turabi, a renown and influential Islamist leader, has said that his country had been unjustly criticised abroad because it applied Islamic laws and revived the concept of Jihad or holy struggle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turabi was quoted by the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) as saying the change which Sudan has been witnessing since the implementation of Islamic laws would take it to the position of leadership in the world. After living through the first half of this century of Western domination, Sudan had revived the concept of Jihad otherwise forgotten in the Islamic world, Turabi said. Western nations led by the United States, together with Egypt and several other Arab states have repeatedly accused Sudan, led since 1989 by the Islamist-backed government of giving refuge and training for Muslim militant groups. Sudan denies the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing achievements of Bashir's government, Turabi said the Sudanese Head of State had ended a state of disintegration under the rule of sectarianism and political parties, in reference to outlawed political groups, the Umma and the Democratic Unionist Party. Upon taking power, Bashir dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution. He also banned political parties, including Turabi's National Islamic Front, thus ending Sudan's third spell of democratic rule since independence in 1956.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Lino Rol Deng, another controversial southerner in Bashir's government, has asked the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to stop SPLA form recruiting Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries. Mr Lino Rol Deng, Secretary-General of Sudan's High Council for Peace was quoted as saying his country had also called on representatives of human rights groups to visit such camps in Uganda, Kenya and Eritrea. The government and the SPLA have accused each other of rounding up men and young boys for military training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum has accused the United Nations of turning a blind eye to SPLA round-ups.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE collapse of Avia Airlines and the South African leg of Sudan Airways has highlighted some major flaws inthe protection of passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who had bought Sudan Airways tickets were stunned recently to learn that not only did they haveto pay a 15 percent excess on their claims, but in many instances they weren't covered at all because Sudan Airways per se continues to operate healthily. TheSouth African leg is in &quot;suspension&quot; and may be resumed later this year. However, this doesn't help thosewho've already forked out for a fare and need to travel immediately.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People don't only take out travel insurance when flying&quot;iffy&quot; airlines. I have, for years, taken out insurance whenever a fare has been one of those penalty-attracting packages which cannot easily be changed, or in case I get ill. The flaw in the present insurance system is that the risk is skewed and the insurance companies have discovered that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Airways (BA) gets a 10-out-of-10 for lending a hand to passengers in distress. BA allowed strandedpassengers special privileges on a standby basis to get'em back home. Compare this with the unbelievably insensitive and unhelpful response of South AfricanAirways' (SAA) Leon Els who said that &quot;it was their choice to fly Sudan Airways&quot;. He's just nullified a few hundred thousand rand of SAA's advertising and public relations budget in one foul swoop.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous government refused requests from theAssociation of Southern African Travel Agents (Asata)for a small levy to be imposed on all airfares to allowthe creation of a travel-industry trust or fidelityfund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market forces should have been allowed to dictate themechanisms for default-insurance procedures. I hope thepresent government will recognise this and leave decisions affecting specific industries and services tothose in the know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the subject of air travel, it's saddening to notethat airlines are going for the jugulars of oppositionairlines yet again. This certainly contributed to thedemise of Flite Star and it seems airlines are using thesame tactics to get rid of Phoenix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of trying to win passengers by offering thembetter service, some airlines seem hell-bent on thedestruction of the opposition. Competition is scary,remember?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comair's ad about its R14-million trust fund forpassenger protection focuses more on a challenge toopposition airlines to do likewise than on the meritsof its plan. It is interesting to note that SAA'sformer head marketing honcho is now at Comair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not for one moment advocating protection of somesort, just a more consumer-benefiting approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan Carlzon, the famed President of Scandinavian Airlines, says: &quot;You'll never be 50 percent better than your opposition at what you do. If they were so bad,they'd be out of business. What you've got to do is be one percent better at 1 000 little things.&quot; Travel industry please take note.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 25, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special National Intelligence briefing to the Cabineton how to deal with sensitive and potentially embarrassing information and prevent leaks has been leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern about security leaks and sabotage of government plans prompted National Intelligence to brief Cabinet on how to safeguard sensitive information. A document on safety measures was distributed in the recent Cabinet briefing, and has since then been distributedto government ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document urges civil servants to be ever-vigilant when dealing with matters that could embarrass, damage or bring down the government. In particular, it lays out guidelines for preserving confidentiality and sensitive information, which could either be contained in documents or on computers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implicit in the preamble is the warning that there maybe forces at work to sabotage the RDP and the country's transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors of the document note that there has been an&quot;escalation of intelligence activities by a growing number of foreign countries and other interest groups&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from laying down procedures for dealing with bomb attacks and fires, the document describes the differences between &quot;restricted&quot;, &quot;confidential&quot;,&quot;secret&quot; and &quot;top secret&quot; information. According to the definitions, a &quot;restricted document&quot; contains information that could embarrass the government, a&quot;confidential document&quot;, if leaked, could damage the government, a &quot;secret document&quot; might be used by opponents to disrupt the running of government and a&quot;top secret document&quot;, if leaked, could lead to the downfall of the government, the severing of relations with another state or a declaration of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top secret&quot; and &quot;secret&quot; documents have to be kept in strong rooms or vaults, where as confidential documentmust be kept in reinforced steel cabinets. The Cabinet briefing document -- a restricted document -- also contains a number of tips about keys, fires and how to deal with suspicious-looking maintenance men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moe Shaik, advisor to Deputy Minister of IntelligenceJo Nhanhla, would not confirm or deny that the Cabinet briefing took place, but he did say that National Intelligence had a responsibility to protect sensitive government information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that by compiling the report, National Intelligence was not suggesting the need for excessive secrecy. But, said Shaik, &quot;our peace and emerging democracy is fragile and needs to be protected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaik said that foreign countries were interested to see how South Africa was emerging as a democracy, andthat there were interest-brokers who might, for thei rown political or economic purposes, try to acces sconfidential information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaik said that the leakage of classified documents tothe media was a problem. He said that National Intelligence was concerned by recent fires in the RDP and Finance offices. It was speculated in the mediathat the fires could be part of a sabotage campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this attempt to tighten things up ingovernment, Parliament's security remains slack. Many parliamentarians suspect their phones may be bugged and a source in the Freedom Front said this week that therewere times when the party felt the need to sweep its caucus room for bugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A private secretary for a prominent ANC MP said tha they had the sorts of conversations on parliamentary phones &quot;that they wanted other people to hear&quot;, and the National Party said this week it had stepped up personal security over the past few weeks, &quot;because they were aware that other parties were interested in getting their hands on confidential information&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all infiltration is cloak-and-dagger. Common criminals are getting through the barriers. Sources in Parliament's catering department say they suspect that up to R60 000 worth of silver teapots, spoons andcrockery have gone missing. A parliamentary spokesman refused to confirm the figure, saying that the tea set audit was still under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Parliament's silver has been lockedaway to prevent further theft and parliamentarians are being served tea in stainless steel pots.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 25, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">byJustin Pearce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Broadcasting Corporation will lose one of its three television channels at the end of1997, to make room for South Africa's first privately owned, free commercial television broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC will, however, retain its present three channels until then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent business concerns will have the opportunity to put in proposals for broadcasting rights on the third channel, leading to the establishment of SouthAfrica's first terrestial commercial TV channel in1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These guidelines form part of the Independent Broadcasting Authority's report on the future of theSABC in the context of a restructured broadcasting industry in South Africa, handed to Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Dr Pallo Jordan last week. It has not yet been tabled in Parliament, though details of the report were leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is the conclusion of the IBA's TripleEnquiry into the functions of the SABC and regulationsfor cross-ownership and local content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the hearings which informed the writing of the IBA report, the SABC argued that it would have to retain three TV channels if it were to fulfil its responsibilities as a public service broadcaster catering for 11 language communities, and still include enough entertainment material to make the service partly self-financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final set of hearings, however, the SABC conceded that it might be able to relinquish one of its channels after a consolidation period. It appears that the IBA -- which in terms of the Broadcasting Act has a responsibility to preserve the viability of the national PSB (public service broadcasting) service --has taken its lead from this eleventh-hour concession by the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC will retain a monopoly on free terrestrial television and its advertising revenue for the next two-and-a-half years, before the handover of the third wave band to a private company. After 1998, according to the document in the hands of the M&amp;G, the SABC will also have, &quot;in all probability&quot;, a licence for one satellite service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The television services of the former homelands will be merged into these SABC services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is likely to be some debate over the time scale,with impatient aspirant broadcasters wanting to enter the market sooner, but others arguing that 28 months is a reasonable minimum period of time for the SABC to consolidate its finances, for business interests to prepare their proposals for the new channel, for the IBA to consider these proposals, and for the chosen broadcaster to set up the new station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time scale gives satellite broadcasters almost two-and-a-half years in which to establish their audience with only the SABC and M-Net as competition. Some commentators believe this will allow satellite television to gain dominance in the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1998, the IBA will also consider &quot;the financial viability of introducing a second private channel,either nationally or regionally&quot;, but argues that there are limited resources in the country and &quot;there will, of necessity, for the foreseeable future, be a limited number of television stations licensed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA argues that by ensuring these stations are&quot;high quality and distinctly South African&quot;, they will be better placed to compete against foreign satellite sand to encourage foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will now be up to Jordan to prepare legislation to go before Parliament, which will enable the transfer of the licence to broadcast on the third channel, as well as a certain quantity of SABC assets, into private hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the IBA eventually considers business proposals for the commercial station, it is likely that the submissions will have to meet a strict set of criteria as conditions for the granting of a licence. According to the document, the public service responsibilities of the SABC will be shared with other TV channels,including commercial terrestrial, satellite and community TV stations. All television licensees will have to &quot;make some appropriate contribution to addressing the needs of the South African public&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ownership of the company chosen as the broadcaster for the third channel will, in all probability, be required to include a substantial number of&quot;historically disadvantaged&quot; South Africans, in order to prevent established foreign and South Africanb usiness dominating what is likely to be an extremely lucrative business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model outlined in the document given to the M&amp;G has been described as one which &quot;regulates for quality rather than for money&quot;. The guidelines are likely to come in for criticism from those who favour thep roliferation of purely commercial broadcasting in South Africa -- which some believe is the best way to encourage foreign investment in the local broadcasting industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the overall proposals will find favour with those who support the existence of a strong, though pruned-down and independent, public service broadcaster.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special National Intelligence briefing to the Cabineton how to deal with sensitive and potentially embarrassing information and prevent leaks has been leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern about security leaks and sabotage of government plans prompted National Intelligence to brief Cabinet on how to safeguard sensitive information. A document on safety measures was distributed in the recent Cabinet briefing, and has since then been distributedto government ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document urges civil servants to be ever-vigilant when dealing with matters that could embarrass, damage or bring down the government. In particular, it lays out guidelines for preserving confidentiality and sensitive information, which could either be contained in documents or on computers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implicit in the preamble is the warning that there maybe forces at work to sabotage the RDP and the country's transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors of the document note that there has been an&quot;escalation of intelligence activities by a growing number of foreign countries and other interest groups&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from laying down procedures for dealing with bomb attacks and fires, the document describes the differences between &quot;restricted&quot;, &quot;confidential&quot;,&quot;secret&quot; and &quot;top secret&quot; information. According to the definitions, a &quot;restricted document&quot; contains information that could embarrass the government, a&quot;confidential document&quot;, if leaked, could damage the government, a &quot;secret document&quot; might be used by opponents to disrupt the running of government and a&quot;top secret document&quot;, if leaked, could lead to the downfall of the government, the severing of relations with another state or a declaration of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top secret&quot; and &quot;secret&quot; documents have to be kept in strong rooms or vaults, where as confidential documentmust be kept in reinforced steel cabinets. The Cabinet briefing document -- a restricted document -- also contains a number of tips about keys, fires and how to deal with suspicious-looking maintenance men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moe Shaik, advisor to Deputy Minister of IntelligenceJo Nhanhla, would not confirm or deny that the Cabinet briefing took place, but he did say that National Intelligence had a responsibility to protect sensitive government information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that by compiling the report, National Intelligence was not suggesting the need for excessive secrecy. But, said Shaik, &quot;our peace and emerging democracy is fragile and needs to be protected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaik said that foreign countries were interested to see how South Africa was emerging as a democracy, andthat there were interest-brokers who might, for thei rown political or economic purposes, try to acces sconfidential information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaik said that the leakage of classified documents tothe media was a problem. He said that National Intelligence was concerned by recent fires in the RDP and Finance offices. It was speculated in the mediathat the fires could be part of a sabotage campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this attempt to tighten things up ingovernment, Parliament's security remains slack. Many parliamentarians suspect their phones may be bugged and a source in the Freedom Front said this week that therewere times when the party felt the need to sweep its caucus room for bugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A private secretary for a prominent ANC MP said tha they had the sorts of conversations on parliamentary phones &quot;that they wanted other people to hear&quot;, and the National Party said this week it had stepped up personal security over the past few weeks, &quot;because they were aware that other parties were interested in getting their hands on confidential information&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all infiltration is cloak-and-dagger. Common criminals are getting through the barriers. Sources in Parliament's catering department say they suspect that up to R60 000 worth of silver teapots, spoons and crockery have gone missing. A parliamentary spokesman refused to confirm the figure, saying that the tea set audit was still under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Parliament's silver has been locked away to prevent further theft and parliamentarians are being served tea in stainless steel pots.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 25, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">byJustin Pearce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Broadcasting Corporation will lose one of its three television channels at the end of1997, to make room for South Africa's first privately owned, free commercial television broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC will, however, retain its present three channels until then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent business concerns will have the opportunity to put in proposals for broadcasting rights on the third channel, leading to the establishment of SouthAfrica's first terrestial commercial TV channel in1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These guidelines form part of the Independent Broadcasting Authority's report on the future of theSABC in the context of a restructured broadcasting industry in South Africa, handed to Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Dr Pallo Jordan last week. It has not yet been tabled in Parliament, though details of the report were leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is the conclusion of the IBA's TripleEnquiry into the functions of the SABC and regulationsfor cross-ownership and local content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the hearings which informed the writing of the IBA report, the SABC argued that it would have to retain three TV channels if it were to fulfil its responsibilities as a public service broadcaster catering for 11 language communities, and still include enough entertainment material to make the service partly self-financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final set of hearings, however, the SABC conceded that it might be able to relinquish one of its channels after a consolidation period. It appears that the IBA -- which in terms of the Broadcasting Act has a responsibility to preserve the viability of the national PSB (public service broadcasting) service --has taken its lead from this eleventh-hour concession by the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC will retain a monopoly on free terrestrial television and its advertising revenue for the next two-and-a-half years, before the handover of the third wave band to a private company. After 1998, according to the document in the hands of the M&amp;G, the SABC will also have, &quot;in all probability&quot;, a licence for one satellite service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The television services of the former homelands will be merged into these SABC services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is likely to be some debate over the time scale,with impatient aspirant broadcasters wanting to enter the market sooner, but others arguing that 28 months is a reasonable minimum period of time for the SABC to consolidate its finances, for business interests to prepare their proposals for the new channel, for the IBA to consider these proposals, and for the chosen broadcaster to set up the new station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time scale gives satellite broadcasters almost two-and-a-half years in which to establish their audience with only the SABC and M-Net as competition. Some commentators believe this will allow satellite television to gain dominance in the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1998, the IBA will also consider &quot;the financial viability of introducing a second private channel,either nationally or regionally&quot;, but argues that there are limited resources in the country and &quot;there will, of necessity, for the foreseeable future, be a limited number of television stations licensed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA argues that by ensuring these stations are&quot;high quality and distinctly South African&quot;, they will be better placed to compete against foreign satellite sand to encourage foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will now be up to Jordan to prepare legislation to go before Parliament, which will enable the transfer of the licence to broadcast on the third channel, as well as a certain quantity of SABC assets, into private hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the IBA eventually considers business proposals for the commercial station, it is likely that the submissions will have to meet a strict set of criteria as conditions for the granting of a licence. According to the document, the public service responsibilities of the SABC will be shared with other TV channels,including commercial terrestrial, satellite and community TV stations. All television licensees will have to &quot;make some appropriate contribution to addressing the needs of the South African public&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ownership of the company chosen as the broadcaster for the third channel will, in all probability, be required to include a substantial number of&quot;historically disadvantaged&quot; South Africans, in order to prevent established foreign and South Africanb usiness dominating what is likely to be an extremely lucrative business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model outlined in the document given to the M&amp;G has been described as one which &quot;regulates for quality rather than for money&quot;. The guidelines are likely to come in for criticism from those who favour thep roliferation of purely commercial broadcasting in South Africa -- which some believe is the best way to encourage foreign investment in the local broadcasting industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the overall proposals will find favour with those who support the existence of a strong, though pruned-down and independent, public service broadcaster.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Aka Mbikusita-Lewanika</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECURITY means more than AK-47 guns in the hands of soldiers and police officers protecting the minority in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no real security where the majority are used as misguided and abused voters, to be cheated at election time and then forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's rulers and others have understood this. Thus they over-reacted again over some commonly understood pronouncement by certain politicians regarding military coups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The place of violence and the military in politics is not yet an irrelevant topic in Africa. And we cannot afford to ignore it in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present governments of Uganda, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Rwanda are the'possible' cases in Africa which 'may' be categorised as arising out of just revolutionary forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most other African governments, both the military and the so-called civilian ones, better fit the category of unjust and reactionary regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence of the former is more legitimate than of the latter, although in all cases non-violent struggle is both preferred and superior to violence of any kind and certainly to military coups in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence is a corrupting and counter-productive means of struggle, even in a just war. The physical wounds and deaths in its wake can hardly ever be healed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The option to make the struggle peaceful or violent is always in the hands of the defenders of unjust status quos and campaigners for the prevention of the coming of the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can be no lasting security where the majority are economically, socially and culturally insecure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late Dr David Simonda prophetically noted that telephone tapping, eavesdropping, intimidation, false arrests, harassment by security officers and overcrowded and unhygienic prison conditions are crimes against society.  He has written that: &quot;Where such crimes are committed against society, individual members of society do not feel obliged to defend and respect the institutions used for the same oppressive purpose. They will find a way of either neutralising or even destroying such institutions. The ultimate result is crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resorting to brutalising suspects, without due civilised legal process,w ill never control this crime culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a state in which even persons in responsible positions can abusep ublic offices and even endanger lives in a whole sub-continent through dealings in dangerous drugs. It arises out of the reactionary, hypocritical and uncontrolled nature of the present governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zambia, for example, it has sometimes been recommended, even at the ministerial level, that poor people suspected of crime or caught up in compromising situations be shot dead on sight. But for the rich and powerful, the walls of protection reach up to the summit of some nationalauthorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where the precious images of ministers and members of parliament are suspected to have been soiled in the press, a law established a quickservice special express court for political leaders. Crimes most likely tobe committed by the wealthy and political-business classes are cushionedfor velvet high-class treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nominal African governments have gladly inherited oppressive laws, and even added new ones, as a substitute for better orienting, financing, equipping,training, motivating and expanding law enforcement agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new multi-party Zambia is not markedly exempt from these criminal assaults against human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This situation calls for real fundamental change throughout our country and continent. These false starts and counterfeit leaders have provided for what the late Simonda called the &quot;political justification of criminal acts by powerful figures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only justice, fairness and democracy can prevent political and social violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The starting point in the case of Zambia today is to have a good constitution, a good leadership and a good national development programme,on which scores we are still failing dangerously.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Anthony Mukwita</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE yesterday summoned UNIP's Malambo member of parliament Wezi Kaunda for questioning and possible arrest over a matter he raised in parliament about the planned assassination of his father, former president Kenneth Kaunda, by the state intelligence service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plot was first exposed by The Post on June 23 this year, but the policehas not moved on the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda confirmed this in Lusaka in an interview on Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been told to report to force headquarters room 118,&quot; Wezi said.  Police action follows protests from Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda that Wezi was in possession of state security documents and wondered if he was in order to table them before parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaker Robinson Nabulyato ruled in favour of the Vice-President and warned he could waive parliamentary immunity and hand over Wezi to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately, Inspector General of police Francis Ndlovu applied to the Speaker to waive Wezi's prosecution immunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It now appears like the Speaker has waived my immunity. But I have not been informed at all,&quot; Wezi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics have charged that the police action implicated the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the plot is not there, why are the papers being classified as statesecurity documents ?&quot; asked former member of parliament and Lusaka lawyerJohn Mulwila. &quot;Police were running away from the real issue. They should investigate the strength of the allegations made by Wezi and his father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zambia Civic Education Association chairperson Lucy Sichone also came out in support of Wezi saying: &quot; It was the role of parliament to check the excesses of the executive and Nabulyato was wrong to have ruled Wezi out of order.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;HALFAOUINE&quot; (BOY OF THE TERRACES) will have its US premiere at the NuArt Theatre in Los Angeles, September 8-14 (followed by runs in San Francisco, Seattle, Detroit, Philadelphia, St. Louis and other cities nationwide).  (Please check schedule at the end)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film is distributed by the New York-based &quot;International Film Circuit Inc.&quot; which specializes in booking of highly acclaimed foreign films and screening them throughout the country. &quot;Halfaouine&quot; is their first Tunisian film, and they need your support to spread the word to achieve major success for its US premiere.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to their press release, &quot;Halfaouine&quot; breaks new ground in Arab cinema with its flank depiction of sexuality. It tells the story of a 13-year old boy who goes to the women's Turkish baths with his mother in Halfaouine, a working-class neighborhood in Tunis. His dawning puberty stirs up the restlessness of being torn between the man's world which beckons him, and the woman's world which still protects him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film was written and directed by Ferid Boughedir, one of the most well-known film critics in the Arab world, and features actors from Tunisia's acclaimed New Theater. It is a French-Tunisian co-production. Speaking from Paris where he is editing his new feature film, &quot;A Summer in La Goulette&quot;, Boughedir noted that &quot;the film was an enormous commercial success in Tunisia, and although it was shown in neighboring Maghreb nations, Algeria and Morocco, it was banned in all the other Middle Eastern countries, including Lebanon and Jordan. It was even invited to the Damascus Film Festival in Syria, but the authorities would not allow it to be shown.&quot; He continues: &quot;There was nearly a riot at the Cairo Film Festival when &quot;Halfaouine&quot; was shown there, and although they had planned to show the film just one time, they were obliged to show it six times. It was subsequently forbidden for it to be shown in Egyptian movie theatres.&quot; (International Film Circuit press release)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly protests the acts of unauthorized censorship by Your Excellency's government on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) World Television. We also support the BBC's ultimatum that, should unapproved interference continue, it will terminate its television operations in Kenya. CPJ also condemns the recent beating of six journalists by security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC contracted with the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) to re-broadcast its world television news on KBC stations. The contract between the BBC and the KBC stipulates that the government may not interfere in its news broadcasts. Reports indicate that the KBC, on several occasions, has tampered, without authorization, with news items about Kenya that the Minister of Information claims discredit the government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent censored BBC report was its story on the beating of Richard Leakey, a founder of the yet-to-be registered SAFINA political party, and six journalists, including a BBC stringer. On August 18, the BBC issued a statement objecting to the KBC's interference with the broadcast, and threatened to end the television contract. While Your Excellency's administration has yet to respond officially to this statement, Information Minister Johnstone Makau stated earlier this month that the contract would not be renewed unless the tone of BBC reports about Kenya changed. The BBC has been esteemed globally as an exemplary news organization with respect to its objectivity in news reporting and for its far-reaching news coverage. The BBC also remains valuable to Kenya's population as a source of international information and education. A discontinuation of its services would truncate the people's access to this information, to which they have a right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ also condemns the attack against local and foreign press on Thursday, August 10, which was the subject of the aforementioned censored BBC report.  Plainclothes police, youth-wingers from Your Excellency's ruling Kenyan African National Union (KANU) party, and riot police beat six journalists and two other travelers. The journalists were attacked while covering a visit by Richard Leakey, Secretary General of the soon-to-be SAFINA party, to the Nakuru magistrate's court where detained human rights activist Koigi wa Wamwere was due to appear. Leakey was accompanied by human rights lawyer Paul Muite. While Leakey and Muite were assembling in the car park of the court, a mob, which was comprised of individuals whom the journalists recognized as KANU officials and Nakuru police in plain clothes, began to form. The mob launched their attack on Leakey and the SAFINA treasurer with eggs, whips, pick-ax handles, and stones, until they managed to escape the barrage. Both sustained severe injuries as it was difficult for Leakey, who has two artificial legs, to manoeuvre. No on-duty police came to their aid. Shortly thereafter, as the journalists and Muite and his party proceeded to the court, prison guards built a road block, prohibiting their entrance. In the meantime, witnesses report that the mob from below, plus men from two &quot;Government of Kenya&quot; (GK) vehicles with their plate numbers blacked out, also began to create a road block. Realizing the prison guards were not going to offer any protection, Muite and his group fled, breaking through the road block at the bottom of the road. At this point, riot police joined the prison guards, assaulting the journalists with truncheons from the back, and the KANU youth-wingers with whips and rocks from the front. Again, no police arrived to bring order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the melee, the journalists, notably the foreign correspondents, were threatened with death if they reported this incident. Two journalists and one traveler, who suffered fractured and broken bones, were hospitalized, while all sustained severe injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan group of journalists dedicated to the defense of press freedom and the protection of our colleagues worldwide, CPJ condemns the brutal assault. We feel that the involvement of official forces in this attack signals the Kenyan government's thorough disregard for the impartial role of journalists as observers. CPJ also regards this incident as one among many we have documented this year that constitute a disturbing trend of intimidation against the local and foreign press in Your Excellency's country. We urge Your Excellency to order a thorough investigation of this incident and see to it that those responsible are brought to justice. In the matter of the BBC, the Committee respectfully reminds Your Excellency that censorship is a violation of the right of free expression, which is guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, all to which Kenya is a signatory. We hope that Your Excellency will ask the KBC to abide by the terms of its contract with the BBC and cease censoring its reports so as not to deprive Your Excellency's people of their right to information.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is writing to urge Your Excellency to drop charges against The New Breed journalists. Judgment in their case, which has been before the Sierra Leonian courts for over 21 months, is due August 7. We are enormously concerned that if convicted, the defendants, including notable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists among them such as Dr. Julius Spencer, may be imprisoned for seven to ten years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 13, 1993, The New Breed, a weekly newspaper based in Freetown, published an editorial titled &quot;Redeemers or Villains&quot; that asked Your Excellency's government to respond to an article in the Swedish newspaper Expressen that had accused Sierra Leonian government officials of corruption.  The editorial simply cited the Swedish</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">article, in an attempt to seek clarity on the issues. That same day, a group of New Breed publishers and journalists were arrested. They spent the next two weeks in jail, before being released on bail of 40 million Leones -- the stiffest bail conditions ever imposed on journalists in Sierra Leone, indeed almost in the history of the judiciary. The group were charged with a ten-count criminal indictment of sedition, defamatory libel, and publishing a false report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four accused -- Dr. Julius Spencer, managing editor of the newspaper, and a senior academic at Fourah Bay College; Donald John, acting editor; Alfred Conteh, sales manager and Alusine K. Basiru, general manager of the company that printed the paper, have appeared before the High Court, and the Supreme Court on several occasions. On December 12, 1994, the defendants' bail was revoked, and they were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">returned to prison for 35 days. They were released on January 16 this year.  Since then they have made several more court appearances, the last of which was on July 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ would consider it a terrible miscarriage of justice if these journalists were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. We believe that the only hope is for the criminal charges against them to be dropped. We respectfully urge Your Excellency to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan organization of journalists committed to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ urges Your Excellency to uphold in practice the right of journalists to hold and express opinions and ideas, as guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and by Article 9</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, the last to which, we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Sierra Leone is a signatory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Relief in Sight for Humanitarian Aid: Dwindling Aid Budgets Will Have Grave Consequences</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian aid groups from Europe and the United States are warning that steep reductions in foreign aid to developing countries have become an alarming trend in the West that could undermine global stability and rapidly increase the number of people living in absolute poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warning came as aid groups released a new report, &quot;The Reality of Aid 1995,&quot; which shows that aid from the richer countries to the world's poor suffered a substantial decline in 1993 -- falling from $61 billion to $56 billion, a drop of six percent in real terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taken alone, this worldwide decline is disturbing enough,&quot; said Julia Taft, president of InterAction. &quot;But when you consider that the US Congress is now considering an additional 35 percent reduction in development assistance next year, it is not an exaggeration to say that this trend could have catastrophic consequences for hundreds of millions of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taft noted that severe cuts in aid for international programs such as economic development, environmental protection and disease control might pressure other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industrialized nations to cut aid by similar proportions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this trend continues, by the turn of the century, the flow of development assistance could be little more than a trickle, exacerbating global threats such as rapid population growth, forced migration and environmental degradation,&quot; said Taft, adding that &quot;the AIDS epidemic could worsen and outbreaks of infectious diseases like the Ebola virus will become more likely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Reality of Aid&quot; reports that public opinion polls in countries throughout the industrialized world indicate that most people -- including those in the United States -- support aid to the poorest countries. At the same time, however, government support appears to be declining rapidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of commitments to eliminating poverty at the March 1995 Social Summit in Copenhagen, aid as a percentage of donors' GNP fell from 0.33 percent of GNP in 1992 to 0.30 percent in 1993. The US share is equivalent to 0.15 percent -- or one-half the average of other industrialized nations. The United Nations target is 0.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors also allowed their proportion of government spending to fall from over 2 percent to under 1.8 percent for the first time since 1990. In the United States, the proportion of the federal budget that goes to foreign aid is less than 1 percent. On a per capita basis, the US contribution to development assistance ranks last among all industrialized nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, the US is not the only donor nation considering further aid reductions. Germany is expected to cut aid disbursements by 1.4 percent in 1995; Italian aid for 1995 is 60 percent below its 1992 figure.  Canadian aid will decline by 15 percent in 1995/96 and will fall by 21 percent over the three-year period to 1997/98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the traditionally generous donors, the Netherlands has committed to restore aid to 0.9 percent of its GNP by 1998. Sweden has decided to freeze aid at $1.78 billion until the next election -- guaranteeing a real cut in aid over the next three or four years. Denmark and Norway look set to remain the only donors giving over 1 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) say they fear increasing marginalization for the least developed countries, particularly in Africa, where reduced aid is likely to mean further environmental degradation, increased poverty, disease, conflict and refugee flows. The human cost will be terrible, and the long term financial cost is likely to outweigh the price of an effective strategy to assist Africa now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Reality of Aid 1995&quot; explains that aid spending not only makes a major contribution to human welfare, it is also a highly cost-effective investment in the future. For example, an additional year of school for 1,000 women in Pakistan at a cost of $30,000 is estimated to increase wages by 20 percent and prevent 60 child deaths, 500 births and 3 maternal deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increasing share of aid being allocated to emergencies and the growing allocations of aid to debt reduction are substantially reducing the availability of aid for long-term development, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development cooperation has become increasingly sensitive to the links between poverty reduction and gender equality. As 70 percent of the world's poor people are women or girls, any aid agency seriously attempting to fight poverty has no choice but to address women's needs and potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the attention to gender, however, remains at the level of rhetoric.  Despite near universal recognition that investment in education for women and girls results in better returns than perhaps any other investment, most donors are not yet even reporting their spending on basic education, let alone basic female education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donor countries have recognized the global nature of many threats to human security -- including poverty, drugs, environmental degradation, migration and unemployment -- in policy statements and in aid spending. As the distinctions between foreign, defense, development, trade and environment policy diminish, nations are beginning to acknowledge that sustainable development is a matter of both common security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and good economics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is increasingly clear that development cooperation is in the interests of both rich and poor nations. It is also clear that helping poorer countries is seen as a moral imperative by many people throughout the industrialized world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Reality of Aid&quot; calls for all countries that are reducing aid to reverse the cuts -- and for all donors who have not achieved the UN target to honor commitments by setting firm timetables to reach 0.7 percent. Tony German, one of the principal authors of the report, concludes that: &quot;With the number of people in the world surviving on less than $1 a day still rising -- and clear evidence that aid directed to human need is an excellent investment, donors should build on public commitment to humanitarian action and redouble their efforts -- not to cut aid to some of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">world's neediest people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 4, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Jon Swift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the root of all the current upheaval and litigation facing world rugby union is the insistence by the game's authorities that the game be an amateur sport. This iconoclasm, this sticking to the ideals of a bygone era, is rooted in the breakaway just on 100 years ago, when some of the game's participants, largely in Britain's industrialised areas and almost wholly from the working classes, rebelled against taking the hard knocks and losing pay in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rival code of rugby league comprising 13 men against the 15 in union and largely devoid of the messy scrums and line-outs of the amateur game was born. And the players were paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It meant that working men in towns like Wigan, St Helens, Castleford and Warrington could supplement their week's wages at the coalface or similar through a payment for a Saturday game with the added attraction of win and draw bonuses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by far the biggest attraction was the signing-on fee. Tradition would have it that this amount was used to buy the recipient freehold title to his home. It was a system that was both honoured and accepted as an honest adaptation by the working classes of a game invented and perpetuated by the public school gentry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cynics within rugby league would have it, even today, that it freed the hard men from having to push in the scrums so that their lords and masters could cavort in the backline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germane to the current state of affairs in union, the contracts the players in league signed were binding in that an above-the-board cash agreement between a professional body and a professional player was undertaken. There was nothing hidden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In union, this has never been the case. In the days when the amateur rules meant something, no-one was paid. As society changed, so did this true blue ethic. While still nominally amateurs, the top players in union began to both expect and accept payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They bowed to an iniquitous system known as boot money, a term drawn from the intriguing picture of an official skulking round the changeroom after the game and depositing cash in the players' boots while they busied themselves washing off the mud and soaking the bruises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amounts became too substantial in many cases to fit even the average lock forward's size 13s. Take the R3000 a test the members of the Transvaal side supposedly got for making the Springbok team against Willie-John McBride's 1974 British Lions. Translated through normal inflation into today's monetary terms, this represented a direct payment of some R20 000 a test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly this is far more than the official allowance of around R12 000 a man which the national squad earned for winning the World Cup, a competition which generated hundreds of millions of rands to the Channel Island based World Cup Limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be naive to believe that this country's World Cup heroes earned only the officially allowed expense money. You only have to look at the edict by South African coach, Kitch Christie, shortly before the start of the competition that the squad stop all advertising and promotional activities and get down to playing rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly the faces of Francois Pienaar, Joost van der Westhuizen, Chester Williams and James Small were not used on posters, billboards and in national advertising for nothing...no matter how orgasmic it seemed to be for the actors coming face to face with the Springbok captain over a steak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But any monies earned could not, as the International Rugby Board (IRB) decreed, be earned directly from rugby. They had to be from promotional or other activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sense, the amateur players had remained poorly paid serfs within the game with the potential - admitted large in the case of the stars - to earn outside it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was clearly a system bound for implosion. The catalysts for this came in the form of the intentions of two Australian media magnates to dominate the broadcasting of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rupert Murdoch struck first with a R2-billion offer, spread over the 10 years from the start of the 1996 season, for the rights to all representative rugby played by South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, thus far the only three holders of the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three unions hastily formed SANZAR, the company who signed the deal with Murdoch and who were to run the rugby-playing end of things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal was announced by South African supremo, Louis Luyt, on the eve of the World Cup final and the understanding was that increased benefits would flow through to every playing facet of the game, from test sides to development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow though, the members of SANZAR had forgotten to tie up the top players, who far more than any altruistic motives of promoting the game lower down the scale, were the real targets of the broadcasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a difficult situation. The players were amateurs and in some respects beholden to the unions they represented. But, as they could not be paid directly, any contract had to be of a private - one hesitates to say covert - nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The very rules laid down by the IRB dictated this. As such, the legal enforceability of such contracts has still to be fully tested under law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will surely also be the case when the IRB rules - as it must - that the game is no longer an amateur domain when they meet in Paris later this month. Even if such a ruling is made, can contracts be considered retrospective and legally enforceable? Again, the courts must decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue has been further complicated by Pienaar acting as an agent for Murdoch's arch rival, Kerry Packer, and getting letters of intent signed by the 28 members of the South African World Cup squad to join a yet-to-be- launched global superleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Packer's World Rugby Corporation - which has reputedly put nearly R400-million aside for the launch - also has the signatures of a number of other top players both in this country and worldwide and was the entity which brought last weekend's dramatic urgent interdict to prevent SARFU from putting the Springboks under contractual obligation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This came in the wake of a statement from SARFU chief executive Edward Griffiths last Friday that an agreement had been reached between the South African body and the players and that &quot;the storm has passed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One suspects that this was a highly premature appraisal by Griffiths. This week's Supreme Court hearing on the issue in Cape Town and the almost inevitable string of litigation which will follow the finding whatever it is prove that Griffiths and SARFU will have to keep a close eye on the barometer for a while yet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Karen Harverson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa urgently needs trade and investment to drive its development which is slower now than it was 30 years ago, says one of Southern Africa's leading economists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Hawkins, professor of Business Studies at the University of Zimbabwe, was speaking at a Standard Chartered conference held last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that per capita incomes in Africa were lower now than they were in the 1960s, as populations grew faster than economies grew, Hawkins explained that unlike the South East Asian countries, whose rapid economic development was driven by trade and investment, Africa's lack of development is driven by aid and debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the 1960's Thailand's gross domestic product (GDP) was lower per head than Ghana's -- today, it is five times greater,&quot; said Hawkins.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a radical change in certain African countries' economic policies was necessary to attract investment by multinationals which he believed would be crucial in leading the development of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many African governments have shown commitment to the liberalisation of trade and investment policy but have found it difficult to implement these changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem facing many African countries is that their economies are 80 percent commodity-based and highly vulnerable to adverse international trends and climatic conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fortunately, the protracted downturn in commodity prices in 1992 and 1993 appears to have ended and this bodes well for potential investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another plus in Africa's favour was that the return on investment in Africa was greater for multinationals than in any other country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Of course, the risks are also much higher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hawkins said that Africa's best chance for attracting investment was in traditional industries or in the area of privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Excluding privatisation, most investors are attracted to ventures in oil, gas and mining, especially in West Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's difficulties are compounded by tiny markets which hold little attraction for the modern multinational companies, said Hawkins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only South Africa and Nigeria have market sizes topping the $10-billion mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa is the only 'star' on the continent in terms of market size, growth rate and market attractiveness. It's the only market investors view as essential to enter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said investors measured the market attractiveness of a country in terms of resource endowment, political stability, policy environment, infrastructure and institutional capacity, foreign debt-burden and export concentration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of these, policy environment is the most important. Resource endowment is a key factor in attracting investment but not essential as proven by the successful economies of the South East Asian countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said countries such as Mauritius, Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland were seen as &quot;limited scope&quot; countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have good policies and political stability but their markets were just too small to attract investment interest beyond exploitation of raw materials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its market size, Nigeria, along with Cote d'Ivoire, Angola, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Cameroon and Tanzania, was ranked as a &quot;problem child&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These countries have good growth environments when markets improve but the scope is limited by the moderate market size. Investors need to pick the winners and establish joint ventures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He relegated Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Toga, Somalia, Rwanda and others to the ranks of &quot;dog&quot; countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are viewed as no-go countries which will take a long time to develop market attractiveness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned investors to adopt a &quot;watch and wait&quot; attitude to these African countries apart from some exports and marketing outlet opportunities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Karen Harverson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trademark dispute between Chicken Licken owner George Sombonos and US hamburger chain McDonald's will be heard in the Pretoria Supreme Court this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case consists of two applications; one of which will be tried under South Africa's old Trademark Act and the other under the new Act passed in May 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first application -- to expunge McDonald's trademark from the registrar for non-use -- is being brought by Joburgers Drive-In Restaurant, owned by Sombonos, and Dax Prop, a franchisee of Sombonos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be tried under the old Trademark Act as legal action was taken before the new Trademark Act was passed in May 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to South African law, a third party can apply to the registrar to remove a trademark if non-use of the trademark for a period of five years can be proven. A trademark can only be registered if there is intent to make use of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McDonald's first registered its trademark in 1968, re- registered in 1974, again in 1980, once again in 1985 and finally in 1993 shortly after we applied for its expungement from the register,&quot; says Sombonos attorney Sean Ryan of Ryans Attorneys and Trade Mark Agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Twenty-seven years have passed and McDonald's still has not made use of it -- therefore, we are entitled by law to apply for its expungement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McDonald's will contest the expungement applications brought under Section 36 of the old Act which justifies non-use if there are &quot;special circumstances in the trade&quot;. In papers before the court, it contends that sanctions and sanctions legislation constituted such &quot;special circumstances&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McDonald's was seriously considering investing in South Africa as far back as 1979 in the normal course of its international expansion. However, the threat of sanctions and later, sanctions legislation, precluded such an arrangement. The critical five-year period of non-use fell right in the middle of the sanctions period,&quot; says Spoor &amp; Fisher partner Gavin Morley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ryan argues that the Anti-Apartheid Act had two provisions which enabled US companies to operate in South Africa during the sanctions period -- at arm's length, through licensing agreements, or through handing over the reins to a black-owned or -controlled company or person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second application, brought by McDonald's, will be tried under the new Act which has a provision under section 35 which affords protection to foreign trademarks which are &quot;well known&quot; in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the trademark is not yet in use, the evidence in the case, including surveys, prove that a substantial portion of the South African population recognises the name,&quot; says Morley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so, says Ryan. He claims that the McDonald's survey only represents the opinions of a mere 200 whites from households with incomes in excess of R6 000, while a survey conducted on behalf of his client indicates most South Africans have no recognition of the trademark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further slates the passing of the new Trademark Act which he views as &quot;an appalling piece of legislation&quot; which gives more rights to foreigners than South Africans would be afforded in those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US legislation states if a trademark isn't used in two years of registration, it is presumed abandoned and struck from the register unless the owner can prove he didn't abandon the mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, a trademark, if renewed every 10 years, remains registered indefinitely unless a third party applies for expungement after non-use of five years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multinational hamburger chain McDonald's is on track to open its first two restaurants in South Africa despite the fact that the court case over the rights to its trademark has not yet been resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African George Sombonos, owner of franchise chain Chicken Licken, is seeking the right to expunge McDonald's trademark from the South African register on the basis of &quot;non-use&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in the process of establishing a full country office in South Africa and plan to have a mix of operations in this country,&quot; says Carter Drew, newly appointed managing director and president of McDonald's South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is adamant that McDonald's had nothing to do with pressure exerted on South Africa by the United States to intervene in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are operating in good faith and expect to open in South Africa. We have confidence in South Africa's due process system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first two outlets will be based in Johannesburg and Cape Town and will be franchised with individual franchisees owning and operating their own businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three South African potential licensees are already undergoing training in New Zealand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drew says the company expects operations to be up and running by December this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicates that a substantial marketing drive will be undertaken prior to the opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is McDonald's policy to use local suppliers wherever feasible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Suppliers have been identified and will be appointed within the next two to three months,&quot; says Drew, adding that most of the ingredients will be sourced locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restaurants typically employ 60 to 80 people. &quot;It will be some time before the company becomes a large- scale employer in South Africa,&quot; adds Drew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company is the leading food service retailer in the global consumer market place, with more than 15 700 restaurants worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 80 percent of its businesses are locally owned and operated by independent entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa will be the 84th country in which McDonald's opens its doors, and the third African country after Morocco and Egypt. Morocco has two outlets while Egypt has four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drew says that the company will own or lease the property in South Africa on which the restaurants will be sited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portnet may enter into a joint venture with the People's Republic of the Congo to manage and operate the country's major port, Pointe Noire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portnet chief executive Neil Oosthuizen says in-depth discussions have been held with the Congolese ambassador and minister of transport who have expressed serious interest in the South African port authority taking joint control and management of the port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the next two weeks, a Portnet delegation will fly to the Congo to do an on-site assessment of the port's infrastructure and, thereafter, assess the feasibility of the venture,&quot; Oosthuizen says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main requirements of a port are that the harbour has adequate depth and safe waters, and basic infrastructure such as breakwaters and quay wall structures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although uncertain of the exact size and port infrastructure at Pointe Noire, Oosthuizen believes it is a general, all-purpose port similar to Port Elizabeth, handling general cargo, containers and a small amount of bulk commodities using normal crane operation but without sophisticated belt-operation facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe some terminals are operating but the Congolese government is keen to improve the situation and has shown preference for South Africa to assist, despite interest shown by other foreign countries,&quot; says Oosthuizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financing details would be discussed within two weeks and would depend on the structure of the joint venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other options might include contracting the terminal facilities out to private operators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oosthuizen says a major factor influencing Portnet to consider the venture has been the recent relocation of South African farmers to the Congo to build up the agriculture industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is great potential for the production of a large amount of agricultural produce for export as well as increased trade between South Africa and the Congo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Transnet's annual financial results held this week, managing director Dr Anton Moolman said for the first time since its inception five years ago,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet had made a sufficient profit to make provision for the R1,9-billion contribution to its pension fund and still reflect a net profit of R118-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public company inherited a deficit of R17,2-billion in the pension fund when it was first commercialised and has managed to get it down to R4,2-billion this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Improved turnover was reported by transport businesses Spoornet, Petronet, Autonet, South African Airways (SAA) and Portnet, while goods distributor PX recorded a net loss of R297-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PX has now decided to modernise and unbundle into focused businesses to improve its operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll be moving away from rail transportation into road,&quot; said chief executive Wicus Pretorius.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that plans were afoot to modernise depots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We plan to restructure the business and concentrate on commercial and industrial parcels, courier services and express services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portnet's net profit rose 45 percent on last year's profit to R1,1-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A record high of 154,9-million tons of cargo was handled by the port authority despite the labour unrest which had lead to congestion in March and April this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bulk cargo, which accounts for the major portion of its business, rose almost seven percent to a new record of 96,7-million tons, which equals 74 percent of the total cargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New records were set in the export of iron ore through Saldanha Bay of 20,9-million tons and wood chips through Richards Bay of 5,3-million tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal exports through the Port of Richards Bay amounted to 53,7-million tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Container traffic showed the greatest increase with the number of containers handled increasing by 20 percent to a record 1,20-million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The container business is very profitable, so the increased traffic in containers has contributed greatly to our overall performance,&quot; said Oosthuizen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Matthew Krouse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athol Fugard's island, today, is not the isolated penal colony he once dramatised with fellow actors John Kani and Winston Ntshona. His present refuge is a territory of optimism, where he directs hopeful youngsters who symbolise freedoms gained. It's a happy valley of song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By working with the young, Fugard gets what he calls &quot;my monkey-gland injections&quot;. His new play, Valley Song, is no exception, for it is one of many recent instances in which he has chosen to work with someone at least 30 years younger than himself. Here, his co-worker is Esmerelda Bihl, and Fugard's face lights up at the mention of her name.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are both personal and political reasons why Fugard now concentrates his energies on the youth: &quot;At this point in time, as South Africans, we are the happy, or unhappy, participants in one of the most extraordinary political adventures of the 20th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks as if it's going to be an adventure with a happy ending. We're well into our second year down the line, and we haven't fallen apart. A lot of things are still wrong, but we knew that. We knew what was going to be on the debit side after 18 months, and there are no surprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're inclined to forget sometimes is how much we have achieved, how much is holding together. That sense of drama, that incredible adventure, I want to be a part of. And the only way that somebody in my age group -- 63 years old, his entire writing career defined by the apartheid years -- can club into it is by connecting with the kind of young people I've been able to touch, feel, understand and respond to. They're the reality of our new nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Left to my own devices, I would turn into something of a fossil. I'm embedded deep in the mud strata of those apartheid years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Valley Song, Fugard plays two old men: Abraam, a poor, coloured veteran of World War II, who is the grandfather of Bihl's Veronica; and an author who enters their lives. Like The Road to Mecca, the play is set in Nieu Bethesda, Fugard's adopted home. It was here that he began to combine the actual events and characters that would constitute a fictitious play. But the process was difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I structured a story to deal with these two characters, bringing them together as grandfather and granddaughter. I have in my bottom drawer, back in Port Elizabeth, three orthodox versions of Valley Song as a straight play, but it just wasn't working for me. I just couldn't get it up. Sorry about the language, but I just couldn't get hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I realised that somehow I had to match the adventure of writing about this young woman. I had to match it with the same kind of adventure, on my side, in terms of my craft. I had to throw my rules away; I had to tear the stage open to a certain extent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's nothing radical about the play -- it gives you a story line and it follows it. But it does so in a way that I've never used before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's amusing that Fugard refers to playwriting in sexual terms. And he extends the metaphor: &quot;There is a sexual imagery that runs through the play, and it is in relation to the land. It's a disguised subtext. There is this old coloured with a handful of pumpkin seeds, wanting to put that seed into the soil. In a sense, I am that old man, except that my handful is a handful of words, my vegetable lands are a handful of paper. It's exactly the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest handful of paper, Fugard offers a direction for young people to follow, in times of personal transition. A message is embedded in the actions of Veronica, whose ambition is to go to the city and become a star.  But is hers an example youths should follow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like to believe that Veronica is a role model, finding, firstly, faith in herself. On the basis of that faith in herself, and in the pursuit of a dream for herself, she finds the courage to step into an uncertain future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not the specifics of Veronica's dream and her ambition that one lauds. I mustn't judge that. It's her spirit. If somebody wants to be a television star and a singer, and make lots of money, then good luck to them.  It's not the specifics of her vision, but the fact that she has a vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She finds faith in herself in desperate circumstances. She follows through against powerful emotional opposition from the old man. She's up against poverty, isolation and a lack of support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is ironic that Fugard will not question the motives of a character he has created himself. This is perhaps a result of his own mysterious journey, which has led him to settle in Nieu Bethesda. He reflects on this, in the context of his play: &quot;Growing up in the coloured location in Nieu Bethesda is very much harder than growing up in the back streets of Port Elizabeth. But from those back streets of Port Elizabeth, I went on a journey which took me to Broadway and West End. And where have I ended up? In Nieu Bethesda!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fugard's home is now in that desolate valley. He writes of Nieu Bethesda in his memoir, Cousins, that &quot;as the crow flies it is about 50 miles from where I was born&quot;. In this way he has come full circle, yet he is surprisingly unjaded. He retains the energy of a fresh- faced child who, like his character Veronica, is driven by a vision and an obliging resilience. Being world famous doesn't seem to have touched him at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valley Song runs at the Market Theatre from August 15 to September 16. It then travels to the Midlands Drama Festival in Hilton and to Port Elizabeth.  After its South African run, it will transfer to the McCarter Theatre in Princeton and then New York's Manhattan Theatre Club. It is also to be produced at the Royal Court in London</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Phillippa Garson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charges of plagiarism are being leveled against renowned South African writer and educationist Mbulelo Mzamane. The credibility of renowned South African writer and educationist Mbulelo Mzamane has been called into question, with evidence surfacing that he plagiarised extracts of the work of another famous writer and journalist, Joseph Lelyveld, now editor of the New York Times. Mzamane, who is vice-chancellor of Fort Hare University, chair of the Book Development Council of South Africa and chair of the board of the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism, wrote a short story, Entry into Soweto, in a collection entitled Colours of a New Day, published in 1990. The book was brought out to raise funds for the ANC's cultural work. The short story directly reproduces paragraphs of Lelyveld's Pulitzer Prize-winning work Move Your Shadow (1985), inspired by his experiences as a foreign correspondent here in the 1980s. The particular piece from which Mzamane drew describes an incident where he, Lelyveld, knocked down a pedestrian. Here and there, Mzamane has made slight changes to give the work a more South African flavour. Where Lelyveld writes &quot;succession of drab farming towns&quot;, Mzamane writes &quot;succession of drab dorpies (as they are called here)&quot;. Other phrases and descriptive passages are reproduced virtually word for word throughout Mzamane's five-page story. The short-story compilation, which includes previously unpublished works of a string of renowned authors, including Nadine Gordimer, Joyce Carol Oates and Ben Okri, was originally published by Lawrence and Wishart in the United Kingdom in 1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was published here by Ravan and in the United States by Pantheon Books. Ironically, Pantheon Books and the publishers of Move Your Shadow, Times Books, are both divisions of the same US publishing corporation, Random House. It was at Random House that the duplication was spotted. In a letter, dated July 19 1991, to Stephen Hayward and Sarah Lefanu, the editors of the anthology in which Mzamane's story appears, the senior counsel for Random House Inc, Elise Solomon, writes: &quot;I am writing on behalf of Pantheon Books, a division of Random House Inc, to notify you of an extremely serious plagiarism and copyright infringement charge which Pantheon has just learned of concerning the story entitled Entry into Soweto in the above-referenced book. Large portions of the story ... appear to be taken verbatim from pages 11 through 13 of a book by Joseph Lelyveld entitled Move Your Shadow ... &quot;Mr Lelyveld, who is managing editor of the New York Times, is quite upset, and we of course are shocked at the similarities.&quot; Solomon then asks the editors to extract an explanation from Mzamane. In a lengthy four-page reply written five days later, in possession of the Mail &amp; Guardian, Mzamane defends his actions. He admits that the use of Lelyveld's work comprises 50 percent of his short story, but claims the duplication was not &quot;designed to pass unnoticed ... The experimental technique may be controversial in ways I did not anticipate, but deception was never my contemplated end in view.&quot; He describes the way he worked with Lelyveld's material as &quot;experimentation, adaption and transformation -- an open exercise that hardly qualifies to be described as dishonest&quot;. Mzamane says in the letter he was not motivated by profit to write the work, since no payment was expected. He claims the original short story on his computer had a dedication to Lelyveld. He defends omitting any acknowledgment, saying that authors prefer to discover for themselves influences or literary references. &quot;It is an oversight I now sorely regret.  It is my error of judgment, and it is not the fault of my editors, that some such form of acknowledgment as 'dedication' is missing,&quot; writes Mzamane. He cites the works of many classical philosophers, playwrights and poets to justify &quot;a very ancient practice, not of copyright infringement and plagiarism, but of adaptation, sometimes leading to transformation and enrichment ... My purpose, then, was to transform a remarkable anecdote into modern short-story form.&quot; Mzamane says in his reply that he drew on other authors for his story, including Alex La Guma, whose character Shilling Murile, in his work Time of the Butcherbird, is the man knocked down by the car, in Mzamane's story. Once the duplication was picked up, no further copies were printed by the publishers. Other publishing houses expressing interest in the collection were turned away because of the &quot;major copyright problem&quot;, said Hayward, co-editor of Colours of a New Day, from his London office. &quot;Had we, the editors and the publishers, been aware of the origins of the work, it would never have been published. We took it for granted that the works from the three dozen writers around the world were their original work.  It would have been insulting to say to some of the finest writers in the English-speaking world: 'This is your original work, isn't it?'&quot; In Hayward's view, Lelyveld &quot;behaved incredibly honourably throughout. He could have made life so painful it doesn't bear thinking about. But he could see what the book's overall purpose was, the spirit behind it. He didn't want to cause trouble.&quot; Mzamane, who is a professor, did his PhD at Sheffield University in the UK and lectured at various universities in the US before returning to South Africa. He wrote an anthology of short stories and a novel before his Entry into Soweto: Mzala (Ravan, 1976) and The Children of Soweto (Ravan, 1982). Mzamane yesterday declined to comment further. # Joseph Lelyveld writes In a driving rain, at night, he came through the windshield. For an interminable moment I thought I had killed him. We were at the end of a 400-mile drive from Durban that had started at the coast, where the Indian Ocean breaking on rocks sent spume into a gray sky; then taken us through the green hills of Natal, mostly shrouded in mist, up to the highveld, through a succession of drab farming towns, set off by their churches, their gas stations, and their separate black 'locations', until abruptly the openness, the sadness, the sense of the land were lost in the thickening traffic of Johannesburg and we were driving past the movie palaces on Commissioner Street, where overdressed Saturday night crowds came tripping out of the rain. # Mzamane's side of the story In a driving rain, at night, he came through the windshield. For an interminable moment I thought I had killed him. We were at the end of a 640-kilometre drive from Durban that had started at the coast, where the Indian Ocean breaking on rocks sent spumes into a grey sky, and then had taken us along winding paths through the green hills of Natal, mostly shrouded in mist, up to the highveld in the Transvaal, through a succession of drab dorpies (as they are called here), farming towns, set off by their churches with spiraling towers and a cock perched on top, their gas stations, and their separate black locations, until abruptly the openness, the sadness, the sense of the land were lost in the thickening traffic of Johannesburg and we were driving past the cinema houses on Commissioner Street, where overdressed Saturday night crowds of whites came tripping out of the rain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 11,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian, the most &quot;wired&quot; newspaper in Africa, has launched a new media division to strengthen its electronic publishing programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new division, eM&amp;G, will be focused on expanding the M&amp;G's Internet profile, developing specialised electronic services to harness the publishing opportunities presented by the information superhighway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G has committed two of its most senior staffers to this division -- director and former co-editor Irwin Manoim and special projects director Bruce Cohen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manoim, a respected Pringle Award winner and pioneer of desktop publishing in South Africa, is also editor of the M&amp;G's acclaimed computer supplement PC Review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen is one of South Africa's leading Internet publishing experts, who brought the M&amp;G on-line in March 1994 -- making it the first newspaper in Africa on the Internet. He founded MisaNet, an Internet news service and press freedom network linking together the independent media in the sub-continent under the auspices of the Windhoek-based Media Institute of Southern Africa. He has presented papers on Internet publishing at several conferences locally and internationally. He writes the Mail's weekly Internet column Web Feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G's World Wide Web on the Internet site was recently selected as among the top five percent of all Internet web sites by Point Surveys in the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G's Internet services currently include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An electronic version of the paper delivered every Friday to Internet subscribers worldwide;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Mail &amp; Guardian Internet archive -- a fully searchable database of all stories published since July 1994;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* PC Review Online, a value-added World Wide Web version of the M&amp;G's popular PC Review supplement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An online version of the M&amp;G weekly entertainment guide;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The M&amp;G Forum, a lively Internet discussion forum on topical South African issues, enhanced this week by the addition of a number of new WWW forums on computing, eco-tourism and marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are planning substantial enhancements to existing services as well as a wide range of new services,&quot; says Cohen. &quot;The core strength of the Mail &amp; Guardian -- its editorial credibility and quality --- will be the foundation of our electronic services. We aim to deliver to the rapidly increasing local -- and international -- Internet community world-class interactive electronic products and services of real value.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key feature of the M&amp;G's Internet service will be its interactivity with the &quot;hard-copy&quot; version of the paper. &quot;We'll be constantly enhancing the editorial coverage of the paper with additional information, including original source material, on our Internet site,&quot; says Cohen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 18, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Jon Swift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a measure of the determination, talent and sheer guts of the man that Ernie Els would come back from the bitter disappointment of the US PGA the way he has. To understand that, it is worth recalling one of the oldest maxims of professional golf: you can win the Masters one week and miss the cut the next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this aspect of golf which makes it such an intriguing game. The rough always lies right alongside the fairway, the bunkers are always there to turn a shot rifling in at the flag into a scramble to up-and- down for par.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even a seemingly perfect putt can become a wayward miss. Nothing more amply illustrated this aspect of the game than the heart-rending one that got away from Els on the 16th at Riviera. Battling to hold his game together off the tee, Els had fought back at eventual winner Steve Elkington and rotund Scot Colin Montgomerie throughout the frustrating round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is history now that the putt did a complete circuit of the lip of the hole and then agonisingly stayed out. Had it dropped, Els would have been right back in the hunt, could have relaxed a little over the last few holes and perhaps added a second major to his 1994 US Open triumph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This never happened. Golf, to quote the old saw, is a game won by inches.  This marginality is the ethos, the heart of the sporting pastime foisted on the world by the Scots. It also has the effect of turning the top players into either philosophers or basket cases. And in both instances, the verbal outpourings on a round -- good, bad or indifferent -- tend to be of the &quot;I'll just play one shot at a time&quot; variety. And with yet another round, yet another tournament looming, there is truly nothing different to say -- and that's how it is with the details of Els' failure to hold onto that three-shot lead going into the final round of the PGA at Riviera last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This merely underlines the impartiality of the game to individuals and echoes the fate which has befallen many of the game's leading exponents.  World No 1 Greg Norman is just one, and on more than one occasion Nick Price, the man he reclaimed top spot on the world rankings from, is another. Both these men have taken it on the jaw and come roaring back. For in the analysis, there is always another shot, always another round and generally another tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there will be weeks when even the world No 1 will miss the halfway cut and not make a cheque. In this the game differs widely from some of the other contenders in the big-money sport stakes. In tennis, first round losers still earn enough to keep a middling-sized squatter camp in bread and beans for a month. In baseball, basketball and the other sports which generate both individual megabucks and superstardom, the cheque comes in; win, lose or draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Golf is not like that. Miss the top 60 after 36 holes and it's pack your bags, pay your caddy and move on to the practice tee at the next tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, it is apposite to return to Els, who admittedly picked up a substantial amount for third place at Riviera, but nevertheless had to pack his bags and his disappointment and move on to the next tournament as an also-ran. So, the opening round 69 the South African recorded to lie two shots back in second behind Davis Love III in the Ernst Championship at Overlake Golf and Country Club, was a round of special merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Els has shown that he has both the talent and the temperament to step beyond the pitfalls of the week behind him. In this ability lies the seeds of golfing greatness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 18, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Ahitisham Manerjee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam Bacher and Shaun Pollock have famous names to live up to but they are playing their own way in Sri Lanka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a popular myth amongst Westerners that Sri Lankans, and Asians in general for that matter, are all fanatical about cricket. For their part, Sri Lankans have a similar misconception about Yorkshiremen and anyone called Geoffrey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is some truth in both generalisations but the South African Under-24 cricket team in Sri Lanka has been surprised to find the back pages of local newspapers dominated as much by rugby as by cricket. They arrived with only two weeks of the domestic season remaining and enthusiasm for the imminent cup final is tangible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if there is one thing that excites a Sri Lankan cricket fan more than anything else, it is a famous name. The country is less than halfway through its second decade as a Test -playing nation and there are a mere 60 Tests for the statisticians and romantics to reminisce over. In spite of this, or perhaps because of it, the depth of knowledge and interest in the history of the game is extraordinary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And nothing tickles the cricketing palate quite like a famous name. Coach Bob Woolmer was subjected to the non-stop patter of a middle-aged &quot;tuk-tuk&quot; driver who remembered his only previous visit to the island with the MCC touring side of 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Omigod!&quot; he shrieked, narrowly avoiding a lorry full of sheep. &quot;You are Bob Woolmer! I know you! Yes! You play for England ... why you now coach South Africa!?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well ...&quot; said Woolmer. It was the first and last word Bob was able to fit in. The tuk-tuk driver recounted the team of 1976 which was captained by Tony Greig and included three future England captains in Keith Fletcher, Mike Brearley and Bob Willis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see you score 65 in SSC stadium ...&quot; continued the grinning driver.  Woolmer shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Did I?&quot; he muttered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinarily there would have been a few other famous names in a squad of young hopefuls still hoping to build an international career. But this South African squad is far from ordinary. Several other individuals were delighted to see Woolmer again but, as good a player as he was, there are two young men that Sri Lankans were even keener to meet: Shaun Pollock and Adam Bacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It puts into perspective the performances of my father and uncle,&quot; says Shaun. &quot;The fact that they are so well known, even revered, all over the world. It makes me proud ... of course it does.&quot; But isn't it a burden as well, with so much to live up to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Err, not really (yes). I don't really think about it (much),&quot; says Pollock junior. And has father Peter been a great help in his burgeoning fast bowling career? &quot;I've pretty much got to where I am now by myself,&quot; he says, &quot;but I don't mean to say he hasn't helped me. He stayed away from school matches and that sort of thing. I suppose that might have been a bit of a sacrifice on his part. All I know is that I haven't been put into teams because of my name. I went through all the ranks on merit ... Natal junior schools, senior schools, SA schools, Natal and now the Under-24's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One day someone in the Kingsmead crowd shouted to me: 'Hey Pollock, why the hell are you in the team ... because of your old man?' I looked back at this guy and just said, Yeah, of course it is. That's dead right'&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graeme Pollock, perhaps, was even greater than Peter. Certainly his legend is greater in Sri Lanka. But he, too, has had little influence on Shaun's career. If anyone was to benefit from the mighty left-hander's experience it would be his own two sons, Anthony and Andrew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were both amazing players, obviously,&quot; says Shaun. &quot;If I turn out like either of them it'll be a great bonus. All I know is that when I get picked for the senior South African team it won't be because my dad is convenor of selectors! It'll be because I have done enough to deserve my place, like it always has been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam Bacher is altogether a different case. His progress has been too rapid to even notice the effect of being a Bacher. Whatever the rest of the world might have to say, Sri Lankans regard Adam's uncle Ali as the greatest cricket administrator of modern times. With his record as a player and Springbok captain thrown in, Adam, too, has quite a reputation to live up to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have I?&quot; he asks. &quot;I actually played tennis and squash more than cricket when I was younger. In squash I reached number three in South Africa at Under-12 level. But ... maybe it's true when they say that cricket is in your blood. My father Issy was always a squash player but I chose cricket. Ali always helped me, but not technically, mentally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam is an intense character, and always will be. With his high forehead and furrowed brow he more closely resembles an accountant with 24 hours to prepare ICI's year-end financial report, but at least he is quick to admit the potential pitfalls of such a temperament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This time last year I was approaching despair. I had retreated into my shell and couldn't communicate with anyone. I was desperate to succeed, and although I never doubted that I would make it, I hadn't envisaged what the road to success would be like. I began to wonder whether I should set my sights a bit lower. But I learned to relax. Ali helped me, just telling me to enjoy cricket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bacher family really is close and, unlike the Pollocks, one could imagine them spending a communal Christmas -- except it would be Rosh Hashana. And the relationship between uncle and nephew is correspondingly trickier -- in the nicest possible way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Adam handles it much better than I do,&quot; laughs Bacher senior. &quot;He always tells me to relax and forget about it.&quot; But Adam provides a closer insight into the dilemma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ali came to our pre-tour camp in Durban to wish us well. He is very conscious of keeping everything as impartial as possible, so we kept a conscious distance between ourselves. It was pretty amusing, actually, but he called me the next day to say 'Have a good trip' and to remind me to relax and enjoy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam did not disappoint the curious locals when he opened the innings with a fierce knock of 86 from 109 balls in the Under-24's tour-opener against the President's XI in Colombo. And Woolmer has little doubt that Pollock is the fastest bowler in the squad and agrees that, with continued development, he could follow in his father's footsteps as a South African opening bowler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulties of following in famous family footsteps have been well documented. There are as many failures as successes. But Shaun and Adam make light of it. Whether comments come from the man in the crowd, the tuk-tuk driver or from the opposition, they seem more than able to cope. Already they are their own men. Success or failure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 18, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Reg Rumney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blame it on the weather and industrial relations on the mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary figures show economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP) -- the total value of all goods and services, adjusted for seasonal factors -- slowed to an annualised and real or adjusted-for-inflation 0,8 percent in the second quarter of this year. This follows unspectacular growth of 1,4 percent in the first quarter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Statistical Service ascribes the drop mainly to the plunge in agricultural production, which fell almost 42 percent, annualised, after falling 18 percent in the first quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If agriculture is excluded, the economy grew 3,1 percent in the second quarter, a full percentage point higher than the first-quarter figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encouragingly, one of the sectors which contributed to that higher growth was manufacturing, with a growth rate of seven percent. With the exception of mining, other sectors also showed growth. Mining's contribution to non-farm GDP dropped 11 percent, after a decrease of 10,1 percent in the first quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standard Bank economists, in the latest Economic Review, lay the blame for mining's poor showing on &quot;liberation expectations&quot; among the workforce, with gold production worst affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say the fall in gold production can be traced back to a slowdown in the output of underground operations, which account for 93 percent of all gold produced by South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the many public holidays in the first half are a part of the cause, organised labour can be expected to deny vigorously that the problems of the mines are the workers' fault. Whatever the reason, Standard reckons reduced gold production in 1995 is expected to trim potential economic growth by half a percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same vein, Standard has predicted that lower agricultural output could knock at least 0,5 percent off economic growth this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the underlying strong momentum of the economy is welcome news, it means that further interest-rate hikes cannot be ruled out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 18, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Eddie Koch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A plan to mine for diamonds along the Limpopo River is causing the biggest environment controversy since St Lucia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the banks of the Limpopo River between Messina and the Kruger National Park there lies a stretch of South Africa's last wilderness -- baobab thickets, tropical flood plains, riverine forests, a diversity of bird life, and free-ranging herds of buffalo and elephants - - that is set to become the focus of the country's biggest environmental controversy since the St Lucia debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military, a multinational diamond mining corporation, a coalition of green organisations and at least three dispossessed rural communities (each with different interests) are the main contenders in a complex struggle that is looming over how this 80km- long Madimbo Corridor, and its rich mix of natural resources, will be used now that it is no longer needed as a cordon sanitaire against total onslaught from the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present the South African National Defence Force manages the corridor, which straddles the border with Zimbabwe, as a conservation area and buffer zone against illegal immigrants who flood over the frontier. Military authorities have accepted that Venda and Tsonga communities removed from the area in the 1960s and 1980s have legitimate restitution claims -- but will rather pay these people compensation and continue to use the area as a training ground for reconnaissance commandos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last year the army lifted a ban on prospecting for valuable minerals in the corridor and the Madimbo Diamond Corporation (called the Duo Corporation in some reports) -- a 50-50 venture between local businessmen and an Australian mining company called Moonstone -- was given a permit in May this year to look for diamonds that may have been washed down the Limpopo from volcanic pipes located further upstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This news has created an uproar among green groups with the National Parks Board and the Wildlife Society claiming that one of the subcontinent's last areas of true wilderness is about to be strip-mined and destroyed. &quot;If mining goes ahead it will most likely blow any future ecotourism ventures off the map, not to mention the irreversible ecological and archaeological impact,&quot; says a statement issued by the Wildlife Society. The National Parks Board has lodged an objection to the prospecting permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Richard Bluett, a director of the Madimbo Mining Corporation, says his company will ensure that prospecting and mining operations will follow strict environmental guidelines. &quot;Most of the sites where we believe the diamonds are deposited are covered by mopani scrub which we will easily be able to restore. We won't take out baobab forests nor will we mine where there is riverine forest or other sensitive ecological systems,&quot; he told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers at the Mineral and Energy Policy Centre, an independent NGO that is helping the African National Congress develop a mines and mineral policy, say it is possible for diamond mining to exist alongside conservation and tourism. &quot;Alluvial diamond mining does not have heavy ecological impacts and can be tightly controlled,&quot; says John Bristow, a geologist who did doctoral research on mineral deposits of the Northern Transvaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The process does not require chemicals and is remarkably clean although it uses a lot of water. In a country that needs to promote development for 40 million people, it is not helpful to promote an emotional rejection of mining in favour of conservation. The two can exist in the Madimbo area if the matter is handled properly.&quot; He adds that Moonstone would be guided by strict environmental guidelines that govern Australian mining companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caught between the military, the environmental groups and the industrialists -- lobbies made up mainly of wealthy middle class members -- are groups with less opportunity to make their voices heard: the rural people who were forcibly removed from Madimbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend Chief Mutale told a group of journalists who visited the village with the Wildlife Society that he is opposed to mining on his tribe's traditional land, mainly because the Madimbo Corporation had failed to consult him before applying for its permit. But while he was addressing an official press conference, other residents in the village said they favoured mining and pointed out that the nearby Tshikondeni Coal Mine, located on the Kruger Park border near their village, was a major engine for economic growth in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further to the east are the Makuleke people who resided in the northern Pafuri district of the Kruger Park and a strip in the east of the Madimbo Corridor called Mabiligwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They built villages along the river valleys of the area -- living off the fish, animals, wild fruits, mlala palms that could be used to make a nutritious wine, and rich agricultural soils on the floodplains -- until they were forcibly moved in 1969 so that the Kruger Park could be extended to the banks of the Limpopo River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You should tell these people who like wildlife that they should come here and speak to us before they make statements about how our land should be used. And when they come, they should remember we suffered greatly when our villages were destroyed and our homes burnt down so that Kruger could be made bigger,&quot; a Makuleke tribal leader called Gilbert Nwaila told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even today we are the ones who feed those wild animals with our livestock.  (A reference to predators who routinely break the fence and kill goats and cattle in the Mabiligwe resettlement village). Now that we have a chance to get some wealth from that land, we are being told to put even more animals there. It will be very difficult to convince our people that wildlife is better than mining -- and it will be even more so if we are not spoken to properly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're only half-corrupt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is mediocre in the world corruption stakes. Reg Rumney reports on a corruption study that finds the country not so guilty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa ranks right in the middle of a 1995 corruption ranking of 41 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Corruption Ranking is the result of a study done by Berlin-based Transparency International and the University of Goettingen, Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a scale of 0 to 10, South Africa, with a score of 5,62, comes 21st, well ahead in the cleanliness stakes of countries like Argentina, Hungary, Italy, Brazil, and China, to name but a few. South Africa is the only African country ranked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 10 indicates a perfectly clean country, say the authors of the survey, while a zero refers to a country where business transactions are entirely permeated by corruption, involving huge sums in kickbacks, extortion, fraud and the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Indonesia is judged the most corrupt with a ranking of 1,94 New Zealand tops the cleanliness list at 9,55. It is followed by Denmark (9,32) and Singapore (9,26).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Singapore is remarkable in being the only Asian country to be judged among the least corrupt. Most Asian countries found themselves in the company of Italy (2,99), Brazil (2,70), and Venezuela (2,66).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 22, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Carolyn Mwanza</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now almost two months since former president Kenneth Kaunda took over the leadership of UNIP from Kebby Musokotwane, and by now he should have realised it was a very unwise and ill-advised decision to re-enter active politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda, his advisors and persuaders made an erroneous judgment in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interpretation and evaluation of the national political mood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They promised that by installing Kaunda at the helm of UNIP his name and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stature alone would act as a unifying force in the party and would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">automatically bring to an end all the in-fighting and wrangles that have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been the standard state of affairs in the party since December 1991.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, they concluded that the intolerable effects of the Structural</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adjustment Programme (SAP) on the people had created sufficient national nostalgia and that the return of Kaunda to head UNIP would generate a massive and popular frenzy agitating for the return of UNIP to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of these things have happened. Kaunda or not Kaunda, unity in UNIP is still illusory. Three members of parliament have abandoned UNIP, and more are reported set to do so, a clear indication that the Kaunda factor has not insulated the party from schizophrenia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps one very significant error the advisors of Kaunda made is that they overlooked certain salient traits of character that are inherent in Kaunda which could have assisted them in deciding whether Kaunda is emotionally and mentally sufficiently well equipped to lead a political party in a multi-party democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decades as an autocratic ruler must have inured him into nothing else but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">solid and inflexible autocrat. His, therefore, is to issue orders and others to obey, to lecture and others to listen, to decide and others to execute those decisions, to appoint and others to confirm the appointment through a sham and deceitful 'democratic' election, and to dispense and give out favours so that everyone owes him a favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the traits that will divide him from UNIP as he cannot operate in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an atmosphere of free exchange of ideals, debate, compromise and consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should also explain why since he took over the leadership of the party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">almost two months ago he has not been able to enunciate one single idea as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to where and how he intends to lead UNIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because he is psychologically lost as he can't figure out what his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">role is. He is unable to say or do anything out of fear that he might be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stepping on the prerogatives of the secretary general or publicity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">secretary and so on, who might complain publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If only Kaunda could also have realised that it was not that there were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">serious deficiencies in Musokotwane as a leader, but that UNIP as a party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had outlived its usefulness as it has nothing new or fresh to offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent resignations from UNIP to other parties are sufficient proof</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that multi-party democracy is a strange environment for him to operate in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and if this doesn't make him regret his come-back decision, nothing will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ever make him any wiser.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 11 clearing agents are in danger of having their licenses withdrawn</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commissioner of customs has informed me that ZRA has suspended 11</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agents' licenses in a bid to recover duty from them,&quot; said Mike Colinese,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Clearing and Forwarding Agents Association chairman, in an interview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZRA has taken records from clearing firms for perusal after which some may</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tax.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Agents are supposed to clear their goods within 10 days of the goods entry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into the country. But the problem is that these days include Saturdays and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sundays when customs are not working. On top of that, the customs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">department is short-staffed and fails to attend to agents who want to renew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their bonds,&quot; said Colinese. &quot;Instead, it takes 10 to 21 days to have your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bond renewed after a transaction. Customs have admitted that it is their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lack of staff which contributes to these problems with agents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And vice-chairman of the association Robbie Matambo added that the problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could also be attributed to the devaluation of the kwacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An agent complained to me that, for example, a K500 million bond which was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">once sufficient for him to transact a wide volume of business today means</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he can only clear up to three trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goods on a truck can now reach K200 million. It means the bond is down to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">K300 million. By the time 21 days is up two other trucks would have entered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">putting the agent out of business for while it takes to clear all the goods</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and have the transactions acquitted,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is that the agent has cleared the goods by paying to customs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Lusaka but no one has ticked them off, or acquitted them, in their books</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the Chirundu border. There are not enough staff to do that in time,&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 18, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transformation of the African political scene in the last few years has been remarkable. In the 1980s, authoritarian, single-party or military regimes were the rule, not only statistically but also ideologically. There was widespread consensus that western-style democracy was not suitable for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now virtually all regimes feel compelled to accept at least in theory the necessity of a democratic transition, although implementation often lags.  Conceptually, democracy has become the norm, and most African countries have experienced at least a partial political opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such transitions, however, have brought with them unexpected challenges, including ethnic conflict. The sharpening of ethnic divisions has been a regular outcome of democratic openings in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This phenomenon challenges the notion that democratisation simply entails a transformation of the political regimes of existing states, to be achieved by amending the country's constitution, holding elections under international supervision, and carrying out complementary activities such as organising human rights monitoring groups, strengthening political parties and educating voters about their rights and duties. Rather, outbreaks of ethnic conflict threaten not only incumbent regimes but also existing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not a new unique phenomenon. Democratisation re-arranged the map of Europe in the 19th century; it has changed drastically that of eastern Europe, the Balkans and central Asia in the last few years. Changes in Africa have so far been less dramatic, with Eritrea and de facto northern Somaliland the only new states so far. But all countries in the Horn remain on the verge of disintegration, and the future of Zaire and Nigeria is in doubt. We can no longer assume that the political transformation of Africa will simply entail a change of regimes. The real danger is not the possibility of the break up of some African countries into new states - this would not necessarily be a problem - but the collapse of an increasing number of states into utter chaos and mass slaughter. The specter haunting Africa is not the possibility of new Eritreas but the likelihood of new Rwandas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relationship between democratic openings and greater ethnic conflict is a complex one, ultimately requiring separate explanations for each country.  Several factors are common to all countries, however. First the present African state system has been crafted by authoritarian regimes that did not feel the need to consult their populations. The most important principle of the Organisation of African Unity, that of the inviolability of colonial borders, denoted such authoritarianism, although this has often been overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It implied not only a renunciation by governments waging war on each other in the pursuit of territory but also a statement by the same governments to their people that they had no right to self-determination. It meant not only that Somalia should stop going to war to conquer the Ogaden, but the Ogadenis would remain Ethiopian subjects whether or not they so desired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the heavy hand of the authoritarian state starts to release its grip, the issue of self-determination is bound to be reopened in many countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second reason why democratising African states are experiencing renewed ethnic conflict is the failure of nation building since independence. While talking of nation building, African leaders devoted themselves mainly to building the state and, above all, their personal power. Most states became patrimonial, predatory and corrupt but also remained soft and eventually faced bankruptcy. Such states do not stimulate the allegiance of their populations and thus help consolidate a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, 30 years after independence African populations remained to a large extent rural, thus they maintained local rather than national identities.  This should not be a matter of surprise. Studies have shown that such local identities still prevailed in the so-called nation-states of Europe in the late 19th century and were slowly weakened, but never completely erased, by industrialisation, universal education, and geographic and social mobility.  Most of these changes have come but slowly to Africa. As a result, democratisation gives a more important role to communities that are local in their outlook, allowing ambitious politicians to play on regional, ethnic and religious identities to gain support. Such manipulation can then turn what was in origin simply harmless identification with a local community into destructive conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African governments have been unwilling to consider seriously the special problems of democracy in multiethnic societies. African leaders are prone to condemn ethnic divisions while manipulating them for their own purposes, but are reluctant to discuss ethnic diversity as a challenge, which entails legitimate demands and special requirements that need to be accommodated by a democratic state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria and South Africa have shown more realism than other countries in dealing with ethnicity in politics. Yet years of constitutional and political engineering since the Biafran civil war have been undermined by the two great constraints of Nigerian politics: the concentration of oil revenue in the hands of the federal government, which precludes genuine decentralisation and empowerment of state and local governments; and the constant intervention of the army in politics, which precludes democratisation. In the end Nigeria remains very far from both democracy and ethnic reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More encouraging, although highly ambiguous, is the case of South Africa, where the African National Congress, in theory committed to a race and ethnicity blind democracy, compromised sufficiently in practice to give the most vocal of ethnic groups, whites and Zulus, special representation in the political system. But the transition in South Africa is too recent, and the compromise too dependent on the good will of a few individuals, to provide clear lessons for other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition of these two countries, where genuine efforts have been made to structure a political system making democracy possible despite ethnic divisions, Ethiopia also is developing a political system that takes the ethnic makeup of the population into consideration. However, the example of Ethiopia so far is one of ethnicisation of the political process but not of democratisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new, ethnicity-based political system has been dictated from the centre. As a result, it has incurred the opposition of most political groups, including the ethnic nationalist movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in the level of ethnic conflict everywhere, and particularly the crisis in Rwanda, have frightened governments and opposition parties in many countries. But fear is not enough. African countries need an arena where the issue of ethnicity in the transition to democracy can be discussed with some detachment from the problems of individual countries, and where some ground rules can be established on how ethnic problems can be tackled without sacrificing democracy. Such a forum may emerge if the proposed Conference on Peace, Security, Stability, Development and Co-operation in Africa (CPSSDCA) comes into existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The (CPSSDCA) is the brainchild of Gen. Olusegun Obasaanjo's African Leadership Forum. Modeled along the lines of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the CPSSDCA is supposed to go beyond the Organisation for African Unity (OAU), which is concerned mainly with relations among states, dealings with its citizen. After an initial meeting in Kampala in May 1991, however, the initiative has bogged down in the politics of the OAU. The underlying problem is the reluctance of many African leaders to set up an organization that would make relations between government and citizen a matter of international concern and commitment, rather than purely the internal affair of each country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revitalisation of the CPSSDCA initiative could make a major difference in ensuring that the democratisation process continues in Africa and in encouraging a more realistic approach to the problem of ethnicity. The problems of Africa and those of Europe are not identical, and African solutions will be different from European ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSCE shows the importance of an international discussion of these problems. It has been active in devising ground rules for ethnically heterogeneous countries. It has drafted charters on the rights of ethnic minorities, on autonomy in local government and on language and education.  Such charters put both governments and mobilised ethnic groups on notice about their duties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 14-16, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Yoweri Museveni is out campaigning to keep his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president is campaigning at a time when what appears an unrelated event is taking place in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Ruling Council's (NRC) Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is embroiled in what is perhaps the most spirited fight again the graft-riddened Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries. PAC has done everything including a raid on the minstry's Entebbe headquarters as officials doggedly continue to frustrate their probe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This PAC effort is double-edged. While on the negative side it brings home sharply to the public the extent of corruption under the NRM government; on the positice side it shows that institutions to fight corruption have been set up, and that some of them, like PAC, have tried to discharge their duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus on the campaign trail, one would have expected the president to exploit such issues to articulate future tasks for government, and to drum up the positives of his rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead the president, apart from repeating his old theme of urging people to fight poverty, is falling into the trap politicians fell into during the Constituent Assembly campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's chosen to play bread and butter politics; giving cows; dishing out bicycles and iron sheets; promising jobs to favourite children in areas he is campaigning in;and even pronouncing on plans to fight baboons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is still morning in the campaigns. If the elections now take place next year, by the time the president finishes his tour of the country, he will have promised iron sheets, bicycles, cows and grinding mills in the millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A presidential campaign is different from a local constituency fight. If the president promises a sub-county bicycles, and the local politician does the same, where is the difference in the call of their offices?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president is running a big risk. Apart from diminishing his status, he can't deliver all that he is promising. There are only a certain number of jobs. In many places in the north, and places like Luwero etc., there are grinding mills and cattle which the president promised years ago and yet haven't been delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NRC Committee on Presidential Affairs recently urged restraint; because there are already billions of shillings worth of promises which President's Office hasn't honoured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president needs to focus his campaign on broad national issues, and a vision of the future. What is the plan to solve the education or health crisis for example? What economic and legal reforms does he plan to press if re-elected? Right now, Museveni is looking too much like a constituency politician. He needs urgently to rediscover his presidential voice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Mugabe Yunus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Yoweri Museveni has said that he appointed Dr. Specioza Kazibwe to the post of Vice President because he feared an uprising by women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, who was addressing members of the DRC, elders, opinion leaders and heads of NGOs in Hoima town on August 11, said women are a force to reckon with, &quot;so he thought by leaving them out of big political posts they would one day rise up and overthrow the men.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that in Kazibwe, he saw an able woman leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kazibwe was appointed VP last November, a post she holds together with her other portfolio as Minister for Gender and Community Development. Kazibwe became the first woman vice president in Uganda and only the second in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President said that what is needed now is for people to engage in economic activities which will guarantee them good returns. He expressed concern over the escalating poverty in rural areas. He said his main mission is now to fight uneven development in Uganda. The president said it was now upon the people to fight poverty as the government had completed its task (&quot;Orubimbi&quot;) of providing peace, water and power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier the president donated 20 heifers to women's groups in Hoima and also gave them 200 iron sheets to construct a vocational centre. Bicycles will be donated to every sub-county youth council in Uganda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-American dancers who are on a short visit to The Gambia, have promised to promote The Gambia on their return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chuck Davis, Founding Director of the group, Gambian people are open and made their culture available to them during their visit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that they chose The Gambia for their programme because the people are willing to share their knowledge with others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davis said he has been traveling to The Gambia since the 1970s and the knowledge he gained here is transferred to the people of America through the universities of North Carolina and Duke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pa Modou Joof, a Gambian counterpart, said the group, numbering 14, learned different dance styles and cultures form the Mandinka, Wollof, Jola and Susu.  Mr. Joof revealed that the group also pays for their activities which help some Gambians with income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luther Cox, Jr., one of the members said while in The Gambia he feels like at home and that is why he like The Gambia than other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member, Morris Johnson, Jr., said that Gambian culture is rich and that the people are proud of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leah Gaiser, a nurse, donated some medicine to Gunjur and she hopes to continue working for the future development of Gunjur Health Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visiting members came from Philadelphia, Colorado, Minnesota, New Jersey and North Carolina. They include professional dancers, teachers, a nurse and others.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randall Echols, Moshood Abiola's chief lobbyist in the US, was in Nigeria for meetings with General Sani Abacha and Abiola. He discussed his visit to Nigeria at an interview in Washington, DC with Soji Akinrinade, deputy editor-in-chief of Newswatch. Excerpts follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: What is your impression of the situation in Nigeria after your visit and meetings with government officials?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: My impression is that there is widespread disaffection throughout the country. However, in Abuja, where the population density is not bad and other amenities exist, one may not readily notice the disaffection. But after engaging in discussions with individuals within the government and out, I will say that there is some uncertainty as to the direction of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: From your own discussions, did you get any sign from government officials that they know how Nigerians feel about the present situation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: I didn't get that impression, I got the impression that government was ready to position itself in power, and was prepared to do whatever was necessary to see that they got situated in power. There is a lot of effort to appear organised and presidential rather than to deal with the most threatening issues such as the political crisis and the staggering economy.  However, with Abiola and others still detained, it is virtually impossible to effectively address the problem of the economy, the political and social crises that exist in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: When you met with the head of state, what did you tell him? Did you advise him on how to move or not to move Nigeria forward?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: I did not consider myself in the position to advise General Abacha on anything. What I did was to ask General Abacha what should I do here in Washington that will expedite the release of President Abiola. What should I do for him in Washington with the people that I come in contact with on a daily basis -- policy makers, congressmen, senators, etc. -- that will help expedite the release of Abiola? So, &quot;General what can I do for you?&quot; was the approach that I took with General Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: Did you get any response on what you should do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: Well, General Abacha indicated that he was willing to dialogue and I told him that he can get to me and we had scheduled a follow-up meeting, but I got no specific request as to what one could do that would make the situation more tolerable, that will lend itself to the release of Abiola, the sole focus of the mission. My priority was going over to see Chief Abiola, assess his health condition and appeal to government for his release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: Were you able to see Chief Abiola? What situation did you find him, his state of mind and what kind of things did you observe about him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: Well, what I observed is that the chief is being held in complete isolation. Unfortunately there is cruelty associated with his incarceration.  He only has access to the Koran and the Bible. He doesn't have the time, he doesn't have magazines, he doesn't get his medication on a timely basis, he clearly has lost 50-60 lbs. He is walking with a noticeable limp. He is obviously in need of medical attention. This I shared with the government officials after the visit with Abiola. I met with Abacha on a Thursday night.  We met with Abiola the next day at 3 o'clock. Later that night I reported back to Aso Rock my observations. And I shared with them what I am sharing now about my observations that there is something they can do to not have the cruelty associated with his incarceration. And they said they were unaware of these conditions and they promised they will look into them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch: Now, when you spoke to government about releasing Abiola, what was their response to that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echols: What I shared with General Abacha, is that I thought the sanctions and pressure -- economic and diplomatic sanctions -- coming from the United States will only increase as long as Abiola remains incarcerated, as long as the press remains shut down, as long as the other political dissenters remain in jail; that I thought the pressure on Nigeria from outside including the United States would only increase. And that it was my impression that if he will release Abiola, that it will have a pre-emptive effect on the sanctions that are about to come on in Nigeria, and there are more coming, including a number of things that I can't discuss now. But that if he released him, if he shows some willingness to break the stalemate and show the world , as he says, he is interested in dialogue, and to what Abiola said that he was interested in dialogue as well, to reach a peaceful resolution of this political stalemate as a result of June 12 annulment, if he could do that, I thought, and that was what I told him, it will have a pre-emptive effect, nothing guaranteed though. Many of these sanctions I personally initiated. A, along with others, initiated, provided our views to the United States government and other governments as to what could possibly get General Abacha's attention. Now, if he releases Abiola, clearly I will go to some degree to say we see some movement. General Abacha is serious about a peaceful resolution of this problem, and he is not acting dogmatically.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 14, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Soji Akinrinade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months Zubair Mahmud Kazaure, Nigeria's ambassador to the United States of America, was looking for an ace in the hole. He had been fighting an uphill battle to revamp the battered image of Nigeria in the US. He needed more concrete action from the Nigerian government to convince a skeptical American government and people that the Abacha administration is sincere in its efforts to return Nigeria to a genuine democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kazaure got his wish on June 27 when in faraway Abuja, Nigeria's federal capital, the draft constitution and other reports of the Constitutional Conference were submitted to General Sani Abacha. The head of state not only collected the reports, he lifted ban on politics and promised that his transition programme would be released by October.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how the development will help his battle for the ears and minds of the Americans, Kazaure told 'Newswatch': &quot;Tremendously.&quot; He said the administration had proved once again that democracy would son return to Nigeria and that all that was needed was for everyone, including those in the opposition, to work together with the Nigerian government to ensure peace, unity and stability in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambassador had a right to express his optimism. That week, which started Sunday, June 25, was not a particularly good one for the image of Nigeria in the US. Throughout the week one action or the other took place which further damaged Nigeria's standing among the world's democrats and gave the picture of a nation spinning out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week started with a re-run of the Columbia Broadcasting System, CBS, '60 Minutes' Programme on Nigeria. Mike Wallace, the programme's correspondent who visited Nigeria prefaced the re-run by going through the protests from the Nigerian government and the Nigerian embassy in Washington, DC. He ended up saying Nigeria was still the most corrupt nation he had ever reported from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme showed how foreigners are conned into 419 deals and how corrupt Nigerian officials are. Kazaure told 'Newswatch' that the programme was calculated to embarrass Nigeria because of its political problems and that the decision to re-run it must have been taken after a team of Nigerian investigators showed up in New York to ask CBS to give the team access to some of the information they used in putting the documentary together.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CBS programme was only the tip of the iceberg that week. On Tuesday June 276, just as Abacha was receiving the draft constitution, Randall Robinson, executive director, Trans-Africa Forum, who is campaigning for the return of democracy in Nigeria, was on a Worldnet programme fielding questions from Nigerian journalists and others assembled in Lagos and Kaduna by the United States Information Services, USIS, on Nigeria's political problem. The programme was the talk of the diplomatic circle in Washington and showed that Robinson was a formidable foe of the Nigerian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same day Robinson, his supporters and other Nigerians demonstrated in front of the Nigerian embassy on 16th Street, just a stone's throw from Trans-Africa's office. The protest is on everyday. And although dismissed by Kazaure as consisting of Robinson's staff, it puts the Nigerian political problem on the front burner. Robinson himself on Wednesday briefed some members of the Clinton administration's National Security Council on the events in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Thursday, June 29, action shifted to the offices of Shell and Chevron in Washington, DC. The International Roundtable on Nigeria, a coalition of human rights and pro-democracy groups in the DC area, sponsored a demonstration against the two oil companies drawing attention to the plight of the Ogoni people and asking Shell and Chevron to fight for an oil embargo against Nigeria. &quot;No Blood for Oil&quot; read some of the placards carried by protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Events that week are not isolated. In fact, they happen with incredible frequency; if not in Washington, DC then in other cities were pro-democracy and human rights groups have affiliates throughout the United States. For example, in Boston, Massachusetts, the local branch of the Nigerian Democratic Awareness Committee, NDAC, headed by Muhammed Ighile, June 17 presented Nigeria's political situation to the members of that state legislature. Prior to that, the group had organised a protest march against Ibrahim Gambari, Nigeria's permanent representative to the United Nations. It had also on May 20, in conjunction with Trans-Africa, put together a forum to bring the problems of Nigeria to the attention of the Boston community. In Detroit, Michigan, Kofi Egbo's Nigerian Forum for Democracy has been in the vanguard of those boycotting Shell's services and products in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Houston, Texas, through Detroit to New York, activities of the pro-democracy and human rights groups continue to pose serious challenges for the Abacha administration and its representatives in Washington, DC and the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In essence, the events of the week of June 25 were indeed a testimony to the damage that had been caused Nigeria by the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, and by the fact that the most populous nation on earth, one so rich in human and material resources, is still under a military rule when the rest of the world is headed positively towards democracy. And to compound matters, the Nigerian government, in their own estimation, has precious little to show that it is moving fast towards democratisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lifting of the ban on politics and the promise of a transition Programme next October should have helped to produce some positive results and lead to a better understanding of Nigeria by the Americans, if Kazaure had his way. But that apparently is not the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Robinson: &quot;That is not good enough. It will not command any favourable response from the rest of the world. He should release all political prisoners and victims of the trial which is still going on secretly... . In a country where there are no democratic parties, the military retains the right to arrest without charges and trial and to detain people indefinitely. It is hardly possible that you can have a free and democratic activity in any case.  So, that announcement is not satisfactory; it was just pushed out to satisfy critics of the military regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Oparaoji, president of NDAC and a professor at Howard University, Washington, agrees. He too told 'Newswatch' that: &quot;the actions taken so far do not mean anything because there are certain parameters, certain actions that government should take that can make us start believing that they are serious about moving us out of this logjam...which is principally the release of political detainees.&quot; According to him no one could take the government, seriously about lifting the ban on politics since it said, in the next breath, that rallies were still prohibited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the lifting of the ban on politics has not impressed pro-democracy groups in the US, the conviction of 40 persons, including Olusegun Obasanjo, former military head of state and his deputy, Shehu Yar'Adua has certainly compounded Nigeria's image problems. Apart from the human rights groups' claim that the trial and conviction of the accused persons are further evidence of the abuse of human rights in Nigeria, pro-democracy groups have now become more vocal in pressuring the American government to impose oil and trade embargo on Nigeria if those convicted are killed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kazaure has responded by campaigning across America that the trials were fair and conducted according to the laws promulgated, not by this administration but in 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre of the agitation to democratize Nigeria is Washington, DC. But it started as a move to de-annul the June 12, 1993 election and install M.K.O. Abiola, the undeclared winner of the election as president. Randall Echols, a Washington-based lobbyist and Abiola's executive assistant for US affairs, had as early as June 1993 been in the forefront of efforts to get the Nigerian government to de-annul the June 12 election. Since then, however, many pro-democracy groups started mainly by Nigerians have taken over the fight not only for June 12 but for the democratisation of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until last June, exiled Sudanese opposition leaders and armed rebel movements met more or less clandestinely in neighbouring countries. But in a &quot;bold move&quot;, the Eritrean government openly hosted in the capital, Asmara, a controversial conference of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a Sudanese umbrella movement of both northern and southern opposition groups to agree on a wide range of actions to bring down the regime of General Omar El Bashir, and to work out the basis of an interim administration thereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eritrea broke off diplomatic relations with the Sudan in January this year, following accusations that the Khartoum regime was intent on destabilising Africa's second newest nation after South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then in June, Asmara played host to Sudan's National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella movement that brings together the Arab-Muslim northern opposition parties and the African southern-based politicians and the mainstream faction of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM). The NDA agreed in principal, upon a comprehensive agenda for the overthrow of what participants termed &quot;the repressive regime,&quot; and the basis of the interim period thereafter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those at the conference agreed on a five point plan. The most critical point to many observers is the resolve to end the conflict in the South, through a recognition of the principle of self-determination of the Christian and animist southerners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other points include the implementation of a decentralised administration during the interim period, the setting-up of a secretariat charged with co-ordinating and following up on the activities of NDA constituent groups, the overthrow of General Bashir's regime and the establishment of a secular state where religion plays no part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Asmara conference it is hoped will create a momentum within the broader Sudan opposition for the overthrow of the Khartoum regime of LT. Gen Omar El Bashir who took power in a military coup in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past and for several years, suspicion and mistrust has characterised relations between northerners and southerners. &quot;The Asmara conference, if it was genuine, represents a turning point,&quot; observers noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting traditional rivalries aside, observers further noted that Asmara was the first time northern political parties such as the Umma, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and others, recognised the principle of self- determination for southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition all parties, including the SPLM agreed that the present and previous regimes had distorted the causes of the war in southern Sudan, by describing it as a conflict between Muslims and non-Muslims. This they said, conjures up the religious passions of most people and succeeds in blurring the real causes of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the more controversial issues discussed at Asmara was the problem of regions such as Abyei, the Nuba Mountains and the Ingessina Hills, which although geographically part of the North, are affected by the war. The political future of the regions and the possibilities of their wish to go with southern Sudan was a ticklish issue that remained unresolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference set up a sub-committee of eleven members to follow these issues. They include heads of nine parties: Mohammed Osman El-Mirghani, leader of the DUP as chairman and LT. Gen. Fatih Mohammed Ali, leader of the Legitimate Command as deputy chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others include leader of the SPLM and commander of the SPLM army (SPLA), Col. Dr. John Garang; Dr. Omer Nur El-Dayem, Secretary-General of the Umma Party; Eliaba James Surur, leader of the Union of the African Parties (USAP); Tighani El-Tayeb, leader of the Communist Party of Sudan; and Hashim Mohammed Ahmed, leader of a trade union movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent members who will be in charge of military and organisational matters respectively include Mohammed Tahir Abu Bakir and El-Tayeb. Whereas some members of the sub- committee head parties that are confessional in nature, parties based on religion will not be allowed to register in the envisaged &quot;new Sudan&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants recognised the positive role the Inter-Governmental Authority for Drought and Desertification (IGADD), a regional grouping that has been involved in mediating peace to end the Sudanese conflict, and asked IGADD to incorporate in future peace initiatives the NDA agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics of the Asmara conference are not convinced that the Umma, DUP and other northern parties are genuine in their declared acceptance of secularism and self-determination for the south. This is only a tactical, but temporary political move, to coopt the south in &quot;their bitter rivalry&quot; to overthrow the National Islamic Front (NIF) government, and impose a less fundamentalist but all the same Islamic regime, said one southerner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some northerners also critised the Asmara conference. El-Hadi Bushra, a retired major general and a member of the Legitimate Command, the NDA military wing, described the conference as an affront to Islam and Arabs.  El-Hadi Bushra has since rejoined the regime in Khartoum to &quot;fight for Islam and for the unity of one Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the SPLA faction of John Garang has been accused of signing the Asmara agreement without consulting other &quot;equally important&quot; groups. &quot;This agreement would have been strong enough if the South was united,&quot; said Dr. Amon Wantok member of a south-based group keen on presenting a united front in any negotiations with the north. &quot;The South must stand as a block to deal with any situation at all,&quot; Dr. Wantok stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Asmara plan received another jolt mid this month when Khartoum announced that government troops had on Saturday August 12, captured Kaya, a rebel town on a key supply route near the Ugandan border. John Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army a major partner in the NDA held the town since 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that thousands of northerners powered in the streets of Khartoum to march in celebration of the capture, does not speak well of the northern-dominated NDA and the Asmara agreement,&quot; said an observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march ended at the army's general command where First Vice-President Major-general Al-Zubeir Mohammad Saleh told the crowds all rebel held land would soon be liberated. The army's capture of Kaya, was the first major offensive, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by K. Botchwey and A. Biney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claiming frustration and fatigue, Ghana's Finance Minister, Dr. Kwesi Botchwey quit his post last July and became both a villain and a hero for &quot;getting off&quot; Flt. Lt. Jerry Rawlings' boat at a time when the president needed him most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a villain! No, he is a hero! Opinions may be divided, but in the murky politics of Ghana, it is possible to be both. Dr. Kwesi Botchwey is one such personality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month since he quit the government of Flt. Jerry Rawlings, many Ghanaians are still debating why Dr. Kwesi Botchwey, the country's longest serving Minister of Finance &quot;got off the boat at a most critical point in time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is critical because for most of this year, Ghana has been rocked by cost-of-living protests, with many people saying they had little or nothing to show for (the IMF and World Bank-inspired) economic reforms. At the same time, President Jerry Rawlings and his ruling National Democratic Congress face a general and presidential election in the second half of 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already some opposition parties are considering an alliance that would present one common presidential candidate against NDC's &quot;indomitable airman&quot;.  The least Rawlings expected at this moment in time, is a resignation of his confident and senior minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognising the ideological diversity of opposition parties, Sekou Nkrumah, second son of the founding father of independent Ghana and renowned pan-Africanist, the late Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, last year called on Ghanaians &quot;to face the realities, even though some may not be happy with the alliance.&quot; Sekou Nkrumah is secretary to the publicity committee of the &quot;Nkrumaist&quot; Peoples Convention Party (PCP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings was sworn in as the constitutionally elected president of the country's Fourth Republic for a four year term in January 1992, after winning the controversial presidential race in November of the previous year. This was the third time the military turned-civilian ruler assumed the presidency.  On the first two occasions he assumed office as head of state after successful military coups in 1979 and 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the November 1991 polls, Rawlings, heading the NDC formed out of his former ruling Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC), polled 58.6 per cent of the valid votes cast. His closest rival, Professor Albert Adu Bohaen of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), garnered 30.1 per cent of the votes in a poll the opposition said was rigged with the PNDC acting as &quot;player, referee and match commissioner&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings had been ruling the country for the second time for eleven years, since 1981. In that year, Rawlings stormed out of the barracks yet again to take power from the civilian government of President Hilla Limann to whom he had handed power in 1979, the same year he overthrew Lt. Gen. Fredrick Akuffo and organised elections that Hilla Limann won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite touting Ghana as a World Bank and IMF success story, Rawlings' &quot;civilian rule&quot; has been characterised by greater impoverishing of the population, while enriching &quot;a few traders, well placed exporters and corrupt officials.&quot; For many Ghanaians, Dr. Botchwey's exist means that &quot;some of his policies may be reversed, if for nothing else, to find a scape goat for the government's poor performance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1983 when the country's Economic Recovery Programme started, Dr.  Botchwey has pursued &quot;very harsh economic policies which to all intents and purposes have benefitted a few and impoverished the majority.&quot; However, few people were courageous enough to challenge the then military government of &quot;the same Rawlings&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Botchwey was, however, steadfast and had great belief in the policies he initiated. He almost single- handedly attracted World Bank and IMF support in the recovery programme. His policies of deregulation, restructuring, liberalization and the free market policies propelled the economy into the global market. With the cedi more realistically valued the policies also awakened entrepreneurs to the need for efficient management practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately the policies proved &quot;harsh and painful for the peasants, wage earners and those Ghanaians out of the modern formal sector.&quot; After twelve years of belt-tightening and infusion of billion's of loans into the economy, the life of the ordinary citizen is worse off than before. The growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has meant nothing to them, economists have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country where a clerk in the civil service earns as low as $35.00 a month, while transportation to and from work costs about $18 a month and, rent for a single room without electricity or running water costs about $10 per month it can be argued that Ghana is not in the best of times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education has become a privilege rather than a right with 57 per cent of school going children roaming the streets, either serving as common-carriers or selling iced water and dough-nut. Those in school lack teaching and learning aids which make academic work more efficient and effective. Also the health sector has progressively deteriorated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a week before Botchwey tendered his resignation Catholic bishops in the country issued a pastoral letter on July 14 decrying the state of the economy and its effects on ordinary Ghanaians. The bishops noted that in spite of international financial institutions portraying Ghana's economy as a model for other Third World countries, the state of the economy still leaves much to be desired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upsurge of strikes, demonstrations and other industrial actions, the bishops pointed out, are an index to the dissatisfaction of some Ghanaians facing unemployment, and other economic problems. These have brought about high exodus of Ghanaians to other countries, particularly Europe, in search of greener pastures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tragedy is that many of these become criminals and find themselves in prisons everywhere, in the process, dragging the name of Ghana into the mud,&quot; lamented the bishops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops also expressed grave reservation about the health policy of the Government particularly the freeze on the employment of paramedical personnel and the redeployment of 15 per cent of personnel in Church hospitals who are on Government payroll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action on the part of the Government, the bishops noted, is seriously affecting the activities of Church-owned hospitals which are allocated in rural areas. &quot;We would wish to believe that the Government is averse to a situation where we are forced either to close down our hospitals or downgrade them to the level of clinics or health posts, as this will spell disaster for our already marginalised rural dwellers.&quot; But it is an option that cannot easily be discounted if the Government persists in carrying out such a policy, stressed the bishops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the country's educational system the bishops appealed to the Government to pay particular attention to the plight of students and the teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the closure of three of the country's national Universities, the bishops urged that a quick and lasting solution be found to the impasse between the Government and the University Teachers Association of Ghana (UTAG). The UTAG has embarked on a strike since April 1995 over salary scales which the Government has refused to meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rightly or wrongly, Botchwey has been blamed for all these unpopular reforms in the economy, irrespective of their contribution to GDP. &quot;GDP in any case,&quot; critics argue, &quot;is not a measure of the well being of a people in backward economies where the distribution of wealth is heavily skewed in favour of a handful.&quot; Dr.Botchwey has also been accused of supervising &quot;the rape of the national treasury&quot; to fund the 1992 general elections that resulted in a whooping cedis 170 billion (US$170) deficit. Of this amount about cedis 120 billion could not be accounted for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On these accounts Botchwey, who is also said to be shying away from presenting, in an election year, a &quot;difficult budget&quot; that will include the already controversial Value Added Tax, is considered a villain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for opposition political activists, any member of the ruling party, and for that matter a senior government minister, who &quot;sees the light&quot; and quits the &quot;discredited NDC government&quot; is a hero.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Odhiambo James</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massive human rights violations continue to take place in Africa, in streets and in prison cells, with both governments and opposition groups perpetrating heinous abuses, charges the Amnesty International (AI) report for 1994. Torture, using methods that include chaining prisoners and suspending them upside down, rape, electrical shocks, suffocation with rubber and the use of tight leg shacks remained a widespread reality in 33 African countries, further tarnishing the bartered image of the continent. Our APS writer reviews the &quot;changing pattern&quot; of violations documented in the AI report that was released in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty years since the demise of the brutal colonial administration, a review of the African press reads very familiar, but at the same time very disturbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some common lines illustrate the point: &quot;The New York-based Human Rights Watch, Africa has expressed concern over police action in dispersing a crowd of peaceful demonstrators.&quot; The former colonial power has joined other Western donors to &quot;urge the government to respect human rights and hinted on cutting aid.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the lines that authorities love to hate, continue on and on. It is as if nobody, including those in and outside government, care about the image of the African continent and her people, or the implications for development, investment and international reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only Ethiopia and South Africa recorded any improvement on the human rights scorecard according to the 1994 Amnesty International (AI)report released last month. Elsewhere it was the gory business as usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 200 people were sentenced to death in 1994 in 13 African countries, with more than 1,000 people in 15 countries remaining under sentence of death from previous years. More than 200 were actually put to death, the AI report states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar trend was experienced elsewhere in much of Africa, with armed opposition groups equally committing serious human rights abuses, including torture, hostage taking or deliberate and arbitrary killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Maghreb region - Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Western Sahara and Morocco - appalling human rights violations were committed by governments and their agents. This included imprisonment of prisoners of conscience, judicial and extra judicial executions, &quot;disappearances&quot;, torture, arbitrary political detention and unfair trials of political prisoners. Many people died in police custody as a result of torture or ill treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of civilians were killed by armed Islamist groups especially in Algeria. Women, lawyers and journalists appeared to be prime targets in some of the Maghreb countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Central Africa especially in the Sudan, the government arrested hundreds of suspected opponents, trade unionists, journalists and lawyers. Many were prisoners of conscience, most were detained without charge or trial for up to a few months, some in secret detention centres called &quot;ghost houses&quot;. Scores were tortured in Chad and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International also documented human rights abuses by the Rwanda Patriotic Army, which gained control of Rwanda in July 1994 and formed the new government. Hundreds, if not thousands, of captured opponents and unarmed civilians suspected of participating in genocidal killings were summarily executed. Others were detained and killed or &quot;disappeared&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between April and July 1994 an estimated 32,000 people were held in detention without charge or trial. Many prisoners died because of overcrowding. There were also numerous reports of ill-treatment, especially in secret jails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burundi, thousands of Hutus were targeted in politically motivated massacres by the Tutsi-dominated security forces and associated armed groups.  The government failed to control the armed forces or prevent Hutu and Tutsi extremists from arming themselves and carrying out killings. An almost complete breakdown of law and order ensued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In West Africa, Nigeria carried out at least 100 executions in 1994. In Gabon, overcrowding amounted to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment leading to 67 prisoners suffocating to death in a single incident. Another 150 died in one prison in Cameroon because of inadequate diet and lack of medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sierra Leone, where distinction between government soldiers and rebels has become blurred, soldiers tortured, ill-treated and extra judicially executed, captured insurgents or those suspected of being rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Somalia, hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed, including women and children, while in Djibouti scores were tortured. However, says the Amnesty report, positive steps were witnessed in Ethiopia where the government released thousands of opponents detained in the past two years. Authorities also started to bring charges against members of previous government detained since 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In East Africa, Tanzania secretly executed eight. Kenya had the largest number of death-row inmates with 26 prisoners sentenced to death during 1994.  This brought the death row population to 568. Uganda held hundreds under sentence of death at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Southern Africa, in Mozambique's second year of peace, police torture and ill-treatment by security forces continued to be reported in 1994.  Commissions were set up under the peace agreement to monitor the police and security services, but these ended up investigating human rights abuses by police and soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi's first multiparty elections in more than 30 years unseated Dr.  Hastings Kamuzu Banda, whose government had been responsible for widespread human rights abuses. After the election, over 100 prisoners on death row had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. An investigation was launched into the suspicious deaths of three government ministers and a member of parliament in 1983. But Amnesty International continued to receive reports of police ill-treatment of suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world's attention was on South Africa in 1994, as the country's first non- racial national elections were held. The new government established a commission to promote and protect human rights and signed human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the elections, political violence subsided in most of the country, though by the year's end, the toll of political killings rose sharply in Natal Province (KwaZulu-Natal) with at least 75 people killed in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the major highlights of the 1994 Amnesty International report is that women continue to be targeted for state repression. Women suffered every abuse and violation of fundamental rights, including sexual harassment and threats of rape. Some of the women-victims were innocent wives of political activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cases involving women were recorded in some 15 countries among them Algeria, Chad, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan. In the run up to the September 1995 United Nations Conference on Women to be held in Beijing, China, Amnesty International is calling on governments to restate their commitment to women's entitlement to all human rights and to take concrete measures to protect these rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With growing human rights violation throughout Africa, so have the continent's social, political, cultural and economic crises worsened. The report updated to cover January-May 1995 highlights &quot;notorious&quot; human rights violations in Sudan, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Burundi, Rwanda and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the eve of the &quot;second liberation&quot; only five years ago, African political, business and other leaders recognised at various forums that: &quot;The absence of security for citizens, and the pervasive lack of democracy and respect for human rights are to a large extent responsible for Africa's predicament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This state of affairs has in particular made popular mobilisation and effective accountability difficult. It has also further marginalised Africa in the world economy, while political leaders suffer from loss of legitimacy and respect,&quot; noted the International Conference on Popular Participation in Recovery and Development Process in Africa held at Arusha, Tanzania in February 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subsequent (Arusha 1990) African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and Transformation said in part: &quot;We believe that for people to participate meaningfully in their self- development, their freedom to express themselves and their freedom from fear must be guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This can only be assured through the extension and protection of people's basic human rights and we urge all governments to vigorously implement the African Charter on Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ILO Convention No.87 concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless citizens are still tempted to ask: When will Africa create a climate where impunity will prevail no more? When will the perpetrators be brought to justice? When are the victims going to be given back their dignity as human beings? When will Africa create a free atmosphere for the African people to really contribute optimally to the development and growth of their continent as free and happy human creatures? When?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) August 18 - Churches operating in southern Sudan have protested to the Canadian Government over the oil exploration activities of a Canadian multinational corporation, Arakis Energy Corporation, in the region and its implications for peace initiatives to end the Sudanese conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a strongly-worded letter the New Sudan Council of Churches draws the attention of the Canadian Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister, Andre Quellet, to &quot;the consequences of Arakis Energy Corporation business dealing with the Sudan Government and on the future of IGADD peace initiatives in which your Government is one of the supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arakis Energy Corporation has purchased Sudan's State Petroleum Corporation, giving the multinational a 100 per cent interest in blocks covering five million hectares and option to acquire another 12 million hectares. The fields were previously abandoned by the American firm-Chevron Overseas Petroleum International. Now Arakis' goal is to raise US$750 million to build a pipeline from the Hegleg and Unity oil fields, in the Bebtiu region, to Port Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the oppressed people of southern Sudan feel let down by the Canadian Government because of the action of Arakis, the NSCC says, adding that: &quot;While we acknowledge with appreciation that Canadian policy towards the Islamic Government is one of diplomatic pressure, we feel dismayed at your policy, which separates human rights concerns from trade related matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can business opportunities exist in a country like Sudan,&quot; asks the letter, &quot;where citizens are humiliated, tortured and killed just because they happen to belong to a different religion and race or colour?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IGADD peace initiatives, which the Canadian Government fully supports, could also be jeopardised when multinational companies like Arakis engage in business, which is bound to &quot;harden the heart of the Islamic regime towards any peace process,&quot; the NSCC further asserts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter signed by the NSCC Executive Secretary, Rev. (Dr.) Haruun L.  Ruun asks the Canadian government to &quot;do everything in your power to encourage Arakis to disinvest in Sudan in order to persuade the Sudan to opt for peaceful solution in the current civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another protest note to the Chief Executive Officer of Arakis Energy Corporation, Terry J. Alexander, the NSCC says: &quot;We are writing this letter to raise objection to your economic activities in the Sudan. We are deeply concerned about the consequences of such business activities at the time when the international community is putting pressure on the fundamentalist Islamic regime in Khartoum to reach a peaceful end to the conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NSCC urged Arakis to disinvest in Sudan, and join other multinational firms in campaigning for a just and lasting peace in the country. &quot;It is only when that nation is in peace that a conducive atmosphere for investment can become meaningful not only for investors but also the nation and its people,&quot; the letter stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Toronto, Canada-based Inter-Church Coalition on Africa (ICCA), Arakis intends to have the pipeline complete as early as October, 1996. This would help it swing into partial production of between 65,000-85,000 barrels a day, shortly thereafter, with indication that it could reach its full production of an estimated 100,000 barrels per day by January 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If such rapid development is actually feasible, the Government of Sudan could be reaping the fruits very soon&quot;, the Canadian church body said in a report. &quot;It is imperative that as much pressure as possible be put on Arakis,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Sudan Independent Movement (SSIM) has also protested the exploitation of &quot;critical strategic minerals&quot; in South Sudan when the war is still raging. The SSIM said it would sabotage any project by Arakis Energy Corporation to build a pipeline from Liech State (Bentiu) Upper Nile, where the oil is, to Port Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The SSIM, its army and the people of South Sudan will not allow the Government to finance its forces of occupation for a Jihad (holy war) against the South with our oil,&quot; said the SSIM in a statement the movement faxed to APS. The Sudan People's Liberation Movement has also called on Arakis to &quot;abandon its plans on the oil exploration business where she is working hand in hand with the Khartoum Government.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA (APS) August 18 - Ethnic violence continues to spiral in Burundi with some 93 people massacred in a week of bloody attacks between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis. In the first incident, a 100-strong Hutu militia unit on August 7 slaughtered 58 displaced Tutsis, 25 of them children, using machetes and knives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement released by the Burundian government said the militia, who attacked the Kaburantwa displaced persons camp in northwestern province of Cibitoke, did not use guns to avoid alerting nearby soldiers of the Tutsi-dominated army. The assailants fled into Zaire after the attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second attack, exactly a week later, assailants armed with grenades and machetes killed 30 people in the central Burundi province of Karuzi, the state radio reported, but did not specify the ethnicity of the attackers or victims in apparent fear of reprisal killings that could easily degenerate in massive bloodletting. Another 5 people were killed by unidentified attackers in Bujumbura and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, killings by one ethnic group have usually been followed by reprisal killings by the other especially in the capital Bujumbura. Victims in reprisal killings are in many cases innocent civilians whose only crime is their tribe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few Hutus today remain in Bujumbura following &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; which started in March. Those still in the capital especially in the northern suburbs of Kamenge and Kinama, frequently take to the nearby hills as Tutsi soldiers and militiamen battle with Hutu militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the massacres in the first week of this month, a brief period of relative calm followed the visit to Burundi by UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in mid-July, who appealed for reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the same month the Anglican Archbishop of South Africa, Rt. Rev.  Desmond Tutu made a pastoral visit to Burundi on a mission to support reconciliation efforts in that country. But despite the two visits, killings are now reported virtually daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu, who is also the current President of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) with a membership of over 140 Churches and associate National Christian Councils (NCCs) in more than 38 African countries, arrived in Burundi on July 27 at the head of an AACC delegation to consult withchurch leaders on the role of the Church in the process of national reconciliation. Bishop Tutu proceeded to Rwanda on Saturday July 29, on a similar mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Burundi, Bishop Tutu preached at different churches and other sites on issues related to reconciliation. His sermons culminated in a public rally and prayers for the nation in the national stadium in Bujumbura. His sermon focused on the general theme: &quot;Christ our Hope&quot;. Tutu, a Nobel Peace Winner, also met with top political leaders in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all his meetings Archbishop Tutu, stressed the need for the restoration of peace among the &quot;suffering Burundians.&quot; Said he: &quot;This is God's world. God is in-charge. If peace and stability can come to South Africa, it can and will also come to Burundi&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, Boutros-Ghali asked the UN Security Council to set up an international judicial inquiry into the death of Burundi's first Hutu elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, and the ensuing killings. The atmosphere of impunity was a major obstacle to reconciliation, Boutros-Ghali stressed.  Ethnic killings had been estimated at between 20 to 40 before the visit of Ghali and Tutu and virtually all killers went scot- free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army accuses Burundi Hutu extremists of cooperating with Rwandan Hutus in Zairean refugee camps, some of whom were members of the Interahamwe militias. This militia carried out the worst massacres during Rwanda's civil war last year, slaughtering more than 500,000 Tutsis, moderate Hutus and their families. The Rwandans in the camps are reported to be rearming, training and carrying out cross-torder guerrilla raids into Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Organisation of African Unity (OAU) delegation, headed by Nagash Kibrat, a special envoy of OAU chairman and Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi, is currently touring Uganda, Zaire, Rwanda, Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania and Burundi for talks on how to diffuse the escalating tension and put an end to the killings in Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) August 18 - A new body of churches, which aims to &quot;keep the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) is on its toes and to work closely with the Government&quot; has finally gained legal recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Regional Fellowship of Churches of Kenya (RFCK), whose interim General Secretary, Rev. John Wycliffe Wanga, is a former employee of the NCCK, was registered on July 28, under Section 10 of the country's Societies Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued at the end of the new organisation's interim Executive Committee meeting held at Kenya's Lake Victoria town of Kisumu, 400 km North-west of Nairobi, said the RFCK &quot;aims to work closely with the Kenyan Government for the welfare of Kenyans and to keep the NCCK on its toes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not worried of the new Christian body. Our main concern is the tone of some of the statements the officials of the new body are currently making,&quot; the NCCK General Secretary, Rev. Mutava Musyimi told</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APS in an interview. &quot;It's our strong belief that such a new Christian body, should target at challenging us positively. There is too much that is yet to be accomplished in our pastoral mission,&quot; the NCCK chief further said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The long-time monopoly held by the NCCK is at long last broken and we will make survival difficult for them now that RFCK is formally registered,&quot; Rev.  Wanga is reportedly said to have told the Kisumu meeting of his interim Executive Committee. Officials of the new body have also accused the NCCK of being too political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also claimed during the meeting that at least 40 independent churches and three dioceses of the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) were said to have sought membership of the RFCK. The new christian body, which intends to establish its headquarters at Eldoret, about 200 kilometres, north-west of Nairobi, is particularly targeting churches in the Rift Valley, Nyanza and Western provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with APS, an interim official of RFCK who sought anonymity, said &quot;most of our members are former members of the NCCK, who have remained dissatisfied with the NCCK for a long time; but with no alternative. We have simply come to their rescue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rev. Musyimi has refuted these claims saying that &quot;we have already carried out a survey in the said areas and to our satisfaction, no member of the NCCK has officially left us for another church body.&quot; With a current membership of 38 churches, the NCCK is one of the largest and oldest national council of churches in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A legal adviser and trustee to the RFCK, David Ngala, said some members of the NCCK in parts of the Nyanza, Rift Valley nd Western Kenya areas, became dissatisfied with the way money, donated by ecumenical donor agencies for community projects was distributed. Most churches in these regions had a low deal and chose to leave NCCK, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The creation of a new church body, according to Rev. Wanga, has been necessitated by concerns that have been expressed by international organisations sponsoring the NCCK. He said the sponsors complained that funds they have donated in the past have not benefitted the projects they were intended for. He added: &quot;Donors had recommended for the formation of regional bodies through which any funds they donate can be channelled to community-based projects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On allegations that NCCK had become &quot;too political&quot;, the NCCK boss was quick to retort that it was not possible for churches to &quot;disengage&quot; because politics affects all God's people both christians and non- christians alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Musyimi said he doubted whether the new church body was not politically geared. &quot;Going by recent developments, I would not be surprised if the RFCK was a politically-supported plot to finish NCCK,&quot; said Rev.  Musyimi. He also denied allegations of misappropriation of funds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FREETOWN (APS) August 18 - President Strasser has reiterated his government's readiness &quot;at any time, anywhere&quot; to open peace talks with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), despite the rebel movement's rejection of an invitation to attend a national conference to discuss how to return war-torn Sierra Leone to civilian democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the opening session of the conference on Tuesday August 15, the head of Sierra Leone's military junta, Captain Valentine Strasser, told delegates that the four-year civil war &quot;remained the largest single obstacle to the democratic process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are prepared any day anywhere to begin unconditional talks with the rebel movement about the need for a general cessation of hostilities,&quot; Captain Strasser, 29, told the meeting, especially organised to discuss practicalities of holding elections at the end of this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Strasser's government has promised to hand over power to an elected administration early next year after lections planed to take place at the end of 1995. But with nearly 40 per cent of Sierra Leone's 4.5 million people currently displaced, many observers feel the only form of election that could be organised would be a highly modified form of proportional representation.  Many Sierra Leoneans feel the vote should be postponed until the war is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days of registration of political parties ended on August 14, with 17 parties provisionally registered, among them the All People's Congress (APC).  The one-time sole party was overthrown by junior officers in a coup on April 29, 1992 that brought Captain Strasser's National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) to power. The NPRC immediately banned all political parties, only lifting the ban in June this year in the run-up to the proposed vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RUF leader Foday Sankoh launched his rebellion in the extreme south-east of the country in late March 1991, initially to overthrow former military leader General Joseph Momoh, who fled to neighbouring Guinea where he still lives today. The war has claimed over 10,000 lives, according to official statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interim National Electoral Commission (INEC) chairman, James Jonah, a former UN under secretary- general, said that Foday Sankoh's RUF had not replied to an invitation to join the three-day conference. The conference was sponsored by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) as a &quot;reaffirmation of its support&quot; for Sierra Leone's march towards multiparty democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We issued an invitation through a third party, but up to this moment, we have not received any response,&quot; Jonah said. &quot;I regret this very much as this is an opportunity for the RUF to join other Sierra Leoneans to chart a new course for the country,&quot; he declared just before the conference opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the INEC, 155 delegates finally took part, another 250 &quot;observers&quot; were allowed in on condition they paid their own expenses. Jonah stressed popular sentiments here that &quot;unless the RUF is willing to sit for round-table talks peace will remain a mirage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates included representatives of student organisations, Universities, trade unions, women's groups, traditional chiefs and representatives of Sierra Leonean refugees currently living in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia.  Jonah also urged delegates &quot;to avoid the influence of money, bribery and corruption in their discussions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) August 18 - Over 1000 women from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Sudan and Somalia converged on Kenya's Nairobi University for a &quot;Mini-Beijing&quot;, in rehearsal of the forthcoming women's conference in China.  Among issues addressed at the three-day event were economic empowerment and poverty reduction among women. Cultural problems, family and socialization, and violence against women were also discussed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mini-Beijing (August 10-12) was organised to get women's views particularly those that will not travel to China, and to agree on priorities and how to champion them. The women, representing various interest groups shared experiences and views in workshops, plenary sessions and exhibitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But grassroots women, who according to some experts bear the brunt of discrimination, expressed disappointment at having been left out of the preparations. They said their urban counterparts had not briefed them adequately and they had only relied on radio information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman charged that, &quot;rural women have been take for granted for too long.&quot; Other rural women expressed fears that they will not be fully represented in the Beijing UN women's meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the opening day, a &quot;torch of peace&quot; from South Africa that will be taken around several East and Central African countries before African women delegates leave for Beijing, was lit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The September 14-15 Beijing conference will be the fourth world conference on women, the first having been held in Mexico in 1975. The Beijing conference is expected to discuss strategies to remove obstacles to the advancement of women. Some of critical areas of concern identified include poverty, inequality in education, health care, employment and economic participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an earlier pre-conference continental preparatory meeting, over 5000 African women met in Dakar, Senegal, in November 1994, to come up with a common &quot;African Platform for Action&quot;. For each of the 11 areas identified under the &quot;Dakar Platform&quot; the women proposed measures to be implemented by various organisations and agencies under the leadership of national governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognising that women were the primary victims of poverty, the platform stresses the need for specific policies to support female-headed families, which now represent 35 per cent of all households in Africa. The platform further calls for special economic programmes for poor women, especially in the informal and agricultural sectors, and urges for changes in gender-biased laws that limit the economic potential of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other crucial areas covered at Dakar included property rights, land rights, inheritance and asset holdings. &quot;The women's rights had been abused for too long&quot;, the women said, adding that to reverse this trend:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was imperative for gender concerns to be integrated into environmental impact assessments and the overall development process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nairobi Mini-Beijing further discussed these and other issues such as women and the peace process in Africa; women, political empowerment and decision making; women, agriculture and food security; and women and the media. Also discussed were concerns of health and women's reproductive rights, women's legal and human rights and issues pertaining to the youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of these issues which are incorporated in the African Platform for Action adopted in Dakar last year, include a section on the girl-child, making Africa the only region treating this issue very seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIBREVILLE (APS) August 18 - President Omar Bongo of Gabon, the mainland country nearest to Sao Tome, has condemned the coup in the island nation of Sao Tome and Principe, and warned that international military action like the one which led to the reinstatement of Haitian President Bertrand Aristide could be undertaken if the coup leaders refused to heed calls to return the country to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar Bongo's call was supported by France, whose foreign ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux also warned that if &quot;constitutional legality was not restored, there will be consequences as far as our cooperation is concerned.&quot; The French warning followed a threat by the European Commission, which said it would suspend development aid if ousted President Trovoada was not reinstated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel soldiers struck in the tiny West African island nation of Sao Tome and Principe on Tuesday August 15, and seized power in a bloodless coup, ousting the first democratically elected President Miguel Trovoada. The soldiers declared a National Salvation Council to rule the country for the next 90 days pending arrangements for new elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insurrection on the islands located 300 kilometres (185 miles) off the coast of Gabon and populated by only 130,000 people, was led by Sub-Lieutenant Fernando Sousa Ponte &quot;Craque&quot; and Quintas de Almeida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the takeover, the two coup leaders said that &quot;a democratic military coup d'etat&quot; was justified by a social crisis in the country. Ponte, leader of new regime, further said his comrades in the 600 strong army wanted to put an end to &quot;corruption, indiscipline and disorder in the country,&quot; before elections could be organised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite prompt assurances to return the nation to civilian democratic governance within three months, news of the coup triggered disquiet in many quarters apart from Gabon and France. In Washington, a State Department spokesman condemned the takeover and said aid to Sao Tome and Principe, valued at some one million dollars annually, could be at risk because of the putsch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Addis Ababa, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) condemned the coup and demanded that the government be reinstated. &quot;This is an era of dialogue and democracy. Whatever grievances there were in Sao Tome should be addressed through dialogue and not force,&quot; said OAU spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after the coup announcement, diplomatic envoys of Portugal, Sao Tome's former colonial master, and of Angola, another former Portuguese colony, appealed for clemency for the ousted leaders. Portuguese President Mario Soares said his country was ready to offer sanctuary to Trovoada if the coup leaders and the deposed president agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Carlos Graca, who was on the island of Prencipe when the coup took place, said he had not foreseen the coup. But he said he had recognised the population's unhappiness with social conditions, adding: &quot;I am at home and I am well, but I cannot answer any questions because the National Salvation forbids me to make any statement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portugal became the first European power to &quot;discover&quot; Sao Tome and Principe in 1471. The two islands became a Portuguese colony in 1522, before gaining independence on July 12, 1975. The islands make up one of the poorest countries in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the coup, Trovoada, 58, led the country since April, 1991. He recently called for a government of national unity to tackle the problems facing his administration after the country was hit by a crippling economic crisis. The crisis in recent months had forced civil servants, including teachers and doctors, to stage several strikes to ask for massive wage increases of between 300 and 1, 000 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October last year, the former monopoly party of deposed Prime Minister Graca, the Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP), won general elections leading to a period of uneasy co- habitation with Trovoada's Party of Democratic Action. Then in July 1994, Justice Minister Manuel Vaz Fernandes resigned and sources said he might head the campaign of former president Manuel Pinto da Costa for the presidential election scheduled for early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Da Costa, who ruled the country from Independence in 1975 to 1991, also offered to mediate, saying he had already been in contact with coup leaders.  &quot;The first contact was positive. I don't accept this military coup as I would not accept anything which could put the democratic regime in danger,&quot; Da Costa declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we went to press coup leaders had agreed to start talks with various political groups in an apparent bid to set up a government national unity, while Travoada and Graca remained in detention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM - TANZANIA (APS) August 10 - As widely expected three Tanzanian opposition parties have agreed to field a sole presidential candidate in the first multiparty national elections slated for October this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Party For Democracy and Development (CHADEMA), the Civil United Front (CUF) and the National Convention for Construction and Reform (NCCR-Mageuzi) will field Augustine Mrema, leader of the NCCR-Mageuzi to contest the presidency. Mrema is a former Deputy Premier and Cabinet Minister who quit the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (Revolutionary Party) in a fit of anger over corruption issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time Abdulrahman Babu, a former Cabinet Minister in the immediate post-independence government, ended more than 15 years of self exile in Europe to return home as a potential running mate for Mrema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babu received a tumultous welcome home when his plane landed at Dar es Salaam airport on August 4, and immediately told a press conference that he would throw his weight behind the opposition. Since former President Julius Nyerere was openly campaigning for Benjamin Mkapa, the presidential candidate for Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), said Babu, he would also support Mrema, said Babu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babu, a former political detainee in Zanzibar where he was born 76 years ago is seen by observers as a political heavy weight who will provide some counter weight to Nyerere's support for the CCM candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year Nyerere urged Tanzania's mushrooming political parties to think seriously of establishing a post-election government of national unity.  &quot;It is clear now, however, that Nyerere would prefer Mkapa to be an outright winner,&quot; the opposition has charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere's own son, Charles Makongoro Nyerere, a defector from the CCM to the NCCR-Mageuzi, reminded his father that the time was gone when Tanzania was a single party State. &quot;A President for Tanzania could emerge from a party other than CCM,&quot; he asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a senior member of the CUF, Mr. Gideon Nipewa, has warned Nyerere that the opposition would adopt a common strategy against him. He charged that Nyerere who was in power for 23 years until 1985, had ruined the economy with his &quot;misguided socialist policies&quot; termed Ujamaa. The policies were based on getting the country's scattered population in communal villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed Babu himself decried the poverty of Tanzanians upon his return. He said Tanzanians were worse off now than before independence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (APS) August 10 - A coalition of over 30 religious organisations throughout the United States, The Religious Working Group on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been formed to address justice issues surrounding the two Bretton Woods global financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formed at Bretton Woods in the USA, the World Bank and IMF have pursued lending strategies that have impoverished people and communities in the Third World, devastated the environment, and created impossible debt burdens for the poor. In Africa, the debt burden estimated at $164 billion is forcing most sub-Sahara Africa to forego investment in education, health, industry and agricultural production.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;debt crisis&quot; has been exacerbated by the continued fall of commodity prices, prompting the governing body of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), known as the General Committee, to call on the international community to address more critically the African debt burden, the IMF/World Bank terms vis a vis poor countries, and the unfair trading practices of the international market place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued nearly two years ago, the AACC General Committee against a background of rampant human rights abuses, proposed that &quot;African countries be accorded a moratorium of 12 months during which time their respective records on human rights, democratisation and meaningful development would be scrutinised as a basis for debt cancellation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling for greater World Bank and IMF accountability, an end to current structural and sectoral adjustment programmes and the cancellation of debt in the most severely affected countries, the new Religious Group (RWG) has produced a Declaration for Change, signed by hundreds of U.S. religious leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ecumenical group, comprised of Methodist, Unitarian, Mennonite, Baptist, Episcopal, United Church of Christ, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Catholic and secular organisations, institutions and individuals, plans to organise a number of events to coincide with the October 1995 World Bank/IMF annual meetings in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, October 7 and Sunday, October 8, 1995, a forum on alternatives to the global economy will be held by the U.S. Fifty Years is Enough Campaign which has spent the past year educating participating groups on the issues of debt and development, a press statement issued by the United Church Board for World Ministries here, says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, Monday October 9, there will be a press conference at noon, a public rally, and an Ecumenical Prayer Service and Candlelight Vigil at 7 p.m., led by Mexican Bishop and Nobel Peace Prize Nominee, Samuel Ruiz, a key figure in negotiating a peaceful settlement of the Chiapas revolt. Also speaking at the service will be religious and lay leaders from around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, high-level meetings with World Bank and IMF officials are being arranged, and public vigils will be held by individual groups and denominations from October 10 through 12, outside the World Bank and IMF meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RWG is facilitated by the Maryknoll Society Justice and Peace Office in Washington, DC. The United Church of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) are represented in the RWG through the Division of Overseas Ministries and the Board for World Ministries, as well as hundreds of activists across the North America.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan musicians whose litany of woes include the sorry tale of &quot;rags to more rags&quot; seem to have found a new lease of life in gospel music, which appears to be increasingly popular with local music fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimani Thomas, formally of Mbiri Stars today &quot;cooes for the Lord&quot;. Augustus Barasa, once a vocalist cum-drummer with Toddy National band, is now with the Revival Flames, serenading fans with such gospel hits as &quot;Yahweh! Yahweh!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of Kenyan musicians who have abandoned secular music for gospel tunes in recent years is as varied as it is impressive. The nearly endless list reads like a roll call of popular local artists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Sanna, once a saxophonist of the famous Mangelepa, who enthralled fans with acrobatic stage shows now &quot;sings for the Lord&quot;. He refers to night clubs, whose fat he once lived-off, as places &quot;full of sleazy things, easy sex, and excessive alcohol consumption.&quot; His former mate, Bwami Walumona, sings gospel music too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Munyau, a sales manager at Assaatholic and the Lutheran churches' stand on church and politics, stressing that the Church has every right to ask questions on all matters affecting the life of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the country's forthcoming general elections, scheduled for October 29, the CCT document challenged the government to see to it that all officially registered political parties are allowed full freedom and that all legible Tanzanians can exercise their right to choose (vote) in a free atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a specific question the CCT General Secretary, Rev. Angetile Y. Musomba told APS in a telephone interview that the document was the general effort of all churches, both Protestant and Catholic, in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It represents the pastoral concern of churches on the current situation in the country and the need to stress upon Tanzanians to exercise their right to vote and to seek for leadership positions, putting the good of the country before their personal ambitions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Sam Gonza</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forsaken by France, The United States, Belgium and other Western nations who have always quietly supported him, Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko is now hopeful that his prime minister and confidant, Kengo wa Dondo who has the enthusiastic support of donor nations will salvage his image. However, despite major setbacks, opposition and grassroot church groups across Zaire are now intensifying the battle of wits to recapture the political initiative from the government and put the democratisation process back on course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month since the end of the transition period, Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku wa Zabanga is still president of Zaire. Fresh killings of peaceful demonstrators in Kinshasa at the end of July confirm that Mobutu, who has been in power for 30 years, remains obstinate and can still act drastically with or without a mandate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protestors, members of the pro-Lumumbist PALU Party, were gunned down by gendarmes as they tried to reach the Peoples Palace (Parliament) to register their anger that Mobutu was still firmly in power after the five year transition period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transition period, decreed by the Sovereign National Conference in the early 90s, was supposed to allow for the gradual dismantling of Mobutu's dictatorial machinery, and lead to elections. Instead, Mobutu seems politically more sure of himself than ever. The elections are no where in sight, corruption continues unabated with Lebanese diamond and gold buyers, allegedly receiving protection from the Special Presidential Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile soldiers remain un-paid for months and could unleash another round of looting sprees that could yet again, further damage the economy. The President himself continues to be accused of sabotaging the economy so that &quot;the clique in power&quot; may continue to benefit from the &quot;parallel economy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this background, the mainstream opposition, the Sacred Union of Radical Opposition Allies, (USORAL), led by Etienne Tshisekedi, Kibassa Maliba, Mende Omanga and others have served notice that they will start a campaign of disobedience and demonstrations to try and force the government to restore the democratic process. &quot;Killings and terror tactics by Mobutu would not deter us&quot;, officials of USORAL which is working for change in Zaire said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the aspirations of the Zairean people mirrored through USORAL is a transparent process towards real democracy, respect for the decrees of the Sovereign National Conference, a free and independent press and Judiciary as well as respect for human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years ago when the &quot;wind of change&quot; toppled many despotic regimes in Eastern Europe, there was also pressure for African dictators to conform to a &quot;New World Order&quot;. Then on April 24, 1990, President Mobutu announced he would introduce democratic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such was the euphoria that swept Zaire with many thinking Mobutu would soon be blown away, that at one time the National Sovereign Conference nearly wrested all executive power from the despotic ruler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unlike Kaunda of Zambia, Ngueso of Congo, General Karekou of Benin or the de Klerk of South Africa, Mobutu had no real intention of quitting. He only played along to buy time. Drawing from his immense personal fortune, Mobutu withdrew from the trouble-torn Kinshasa, sometime living in his houseboat on the River Zaire but mostly in his palace at Gbadolite, hundreds of miles from the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elite Presidential Guard took control of security and a special unit began to implement a campaign of terror that saw newspaper offices fire bombed and the homes of opposition members attacked with rockets. There was even an attempt to kill the Catholic Archbishop of Kinshasa area, Mosengwo Pasinya, Speaker of the Transition Parliament that succeeded the national conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its annual report in 1994, the Zairean Association for Defense of Human Rights said 60 per cent of the 152 murder or summary execution cases it had recorded were committed by soldiers operating with impunity. The press has also regularly reported on hold-ups, roadside extortions, kidnappings, robberies and rapes committed by &quot;bandits in uniform, throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu in the meantime continued to cleverly play off one group against another within the Transition Parliament. Some were simply bought off. The popular and widely accepted Tshiskedi found his premiership taken over by Birindwa. Birindwa in turn gave way to Kengo wa Dondo, the incumbent Prime Minister and Mobutu's confidant who seems to enjoy the &quot;enthusiastic support&quot; of donor nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a vain attempt to coax opposition politicians who want to ouster him, Dondo on July 22 reshuffled the Cabinet in a move to create &quot;a genuine government of national unity&quot;. However, the opposition which holds the majority in the interim parliament refused to take part in Kengo's consultations to form a new government. It is doubtful opposition figures included in the new cabinet will &quot;bite the bait&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today a large number of Zaire's 40 million strong population feel deeply betrayed as the transition period that initially looked so promising has passed &quot;quietly like a village wedding&quot;, observers have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zaireans are a courageous people, and Mobutu's attempt to foster a regional policy by working one tribe against another as a survival gimmick has not taken root. Spates of ethnic cleansing have died down, observers further say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, grassroots organisations for the purpose of &quot;radical civic education&quot; have sprung up with Catholic church parishes playing a critical role in the awareness campaigns. The campaigns are, however, largely initiated by lay people according to some sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amos Group of Kinshasa, is one such group. The group has organised a number of popular demonstrations in Kinshasa. It regularly encourages members to &quot;challenge fear&quot; and to be actively involved in pro-democracy work and initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyday the people have to be prepared to challenge fear. It is the only way to ensure that true freedom will reign one day,&quot; a spokesman of the group said. The people are taught that having lost everything under the dictatorship of Mobutu, &quot;they should no longer be afraid of losing their jobs or afraid to say 'No' to unjust laws and fraudulent reforms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members, who like their membership in the church, try to shun tribal loyalties are further taught to search their hearts and look to solutions and ways of getting rid of the dictatorship. &quot;Its going to be costly but its ones duty. Educate yourself for democracy and be prepared to assume positions of leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barely two months since the ruling military junta lifted the ban on political activities in an apparent first move to return Nigeria to civilian rule, recent secret trials and sentencing of alleged coup plotters to long jail terms, crackdown on human rights activists and journalists and the harassing of pro-democracy agitators has cast a shadow over &quot;any meaningful&quot; democratisation programme in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by a Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new era dawns on Nigeria, declared the Champion. But for the A.M. News, another independent daily, the Nigerian strongman General Sani Abacha had merely left people in suspense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many critics, among them opposition politicians and pro-democracy activists, seem to share the later view. Bani Fawehinmi, a leading activist and lawyer, said Abacha was trying to set up a political dummy which Nigerians are not prepared to accept.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is pathologically committed to dictatorship because it is only under dictatorship that Abacha can function,&quot; Fawehinmi said. But despite the doubts expressed by most politicians and activists, a few other media groups joined the Champion to welcome the lifting of the ban on political activity.  Abacha's military junta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha announced the immediate lifting of the ban he imposed when he came to power in November 1993, at a ceremony in the federal capital, Abuja, to receive the &quot;controversial text&quot; of a draft new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the ceremony on June 27, Abacha said a new National Electoral Commission (NEC) would be set up to organise civilian elections. He promised to give details regarding plans to give up power to a democratically elected government during his traditional independence day speech in October. The general who gave no further details, however, warned politicians to beware of irresponsible activities that could threaten national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many critics doubted the sincerity of the announcement and could not take it on its face value. Michael Adenkunle Ajasin, one of the founders of the opposition National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) expressed disappointment that Abacha did not use the occasion to free detained politicians, notably the presumed winner of the June 1993 presidential elections, millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NADECO, the main group backing Abiola is composed of prominent politicians, senior retired military officers and pro-democracy activists drawn largely from the Yoruba ethnic group in south-western Nigeria. The group wants Abacha to hand over power to Abiola, also a Yoruba, to form and head a government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the junta is still holding the ailing Abiola, who faces treason charges for declaring himself winner of the presidential poll in June 1994 on the first anniversary of the cancelled elections. The military cancelled the elections when it became evident Abiola was winning. A former head of state and an international figure, General Olusegun Obasanjo, is also being held and his name has featured among the more than 40 people tried secretly for allegedly plotting to overthrow Abacha's junta in March this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has been ruled by military regimes for all but 10 years since it achieved independence from British colonial rule on October 1, 1960. Abacha, described by opponents as a hardline anti-democrat, took over power after the military refused to publish the results of June 1993 elections and set up instead a short-lived hand-picked civilian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting that his aim was the ultimate restoration of &quot;true&quot; democracy in Nigeria and an end to corruption, Abacha closed down all the country's democratic institutions, arrested opposition leaders and banned a series of hostile newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time he formed a Constitutional Conference, dubbed &quot;a charade&quot; by opponents, which he said would map out the future political government of Nigeria. The Conference officially wound up its work on June 27, and presented a report to the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), the top military body headed by Abacha. The PRC is expected to ratify the new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But opponents of the PRC have already dismissed, as undemocratic, the new constitutional proposals, notably the provision for a rotating presidency between the mainly Muslim north and the largely Christian south.  Pro-democracy and human rights groups spurned the Conference, as a farce and a manoeuvre aimed at keeping the military in power. The Conference was eight months behind schedule with its report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the June 27 announcement, Abacha was at pains to show that he was still on the track to hand over power to civilians. But his actions have remained &quot;diametrically opposed&quot; to the supposed intent of the Conference and in particular, plans for the military to give up power, observers have noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the announcement, Abacha ordered the rounding up of more than 50 opposition leaders and human rights activists to forestall any unrest that could result from the arrest, secret trial and sentencing of the alleged coup plotters. The &quot;plotters&quot; include Generals Obasanjo and his former deputy Yar' Adua, two most respected former Nigerian military leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those arrested also include Chief Michael Adenkunle Ajasin, 86, of NADECO who was picked up at his home in Owo, along with scores of others attending a meeting of the &quot;Afenifere&quot;, a group inside NADECO. Chief Ajasin is one of the architects of Nigeria's independence and a former civilian governor of the south-western state of Ondo, while the &quot;Afenifere&quot; group to which he belongs is the core group inside NADECO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several labour activists and opposition members, including ex-civilian governor Chief Cornelius Adebayo, and other leading NADECO members were also taken in at Ilorin, the capital of the central Kwara state, allegedly in connection with a bomb blast a day earlier in the city stadium during the official launching of a government project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers saw the clampdown on the opposition, as part of a bid by an apparently panicky government to forestall any form of demonstration as the second anniversary of the June 1993 presidential election drew near. However, the anniversary passed quietly without major incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Abacha has turned his wrath on journalists, forcing a number of them to go into hiding. Their fear was heightened by reports, at the beginning of this month, that a number of journalists had been arrested and convicted of sedition over stories that criticised the ruling military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this crackdown combined with total disregard for international outcry against the trials and calls for the pardoning of the alleged coup plotters,that has prompted many Nigerians to fear their country was at &quot;the crossroads of a military dictatorship that could eventually destroy the country's international image beyond repair. Most doubt than any democratisation process can commence at all when &quot;the ground is so unlevel&quot; except for those willing to work in cahoot with the military.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabriel Roric Jur, a black African southern Sudanese and a bishop of the Province of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan (ECS) doubles as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in the almost exclusively Arab- Muslim government headed by Lt. General Omar Hassan El-Bashir. Since 1986 Roric, who is Bishop of Rumbek Diocese in the South, has lived in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, following the destruction of Rumbek in fighting between government troops and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Bishop Roric was interviewed by Santino Makur Kot in early August in Nairobi, Kenya where he was attending a senior meeting of the ECS House of Bishops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. As an African Christian cleric from the south what prompted you to serve in a government that discriminates against southerners because of their faith and colour? A. First of all, as a Christian, I am a strong believer in coexistence and tolerance. I also draw inspiration from the story of Prophet Daniel during the Babylonian Captivity. Daniel did his best to save his people from many difficulties especially persecution. There are many other examples in the Old Testament which relate to such situations. I also believe in non-violence. My mission is to put the message of reconciliation to the Government and opposition groups with a view to normalising the existing situation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. How did you join the Islamic Government?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Before my appointment to the Cabinet, I served in 1988 as a member of the Council for Mercy, a Christian-Muslim group that was set up to work for peace through dialogue. My church nominated me to the Council. I saw my appointment as another window which God had opened for the church's voice to be heard beyond and within the Islamic Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. But in spite of your presence in the government the war has dragged on and your government continues to be accused of a policy of Islamisation and annihilation of your fellow southerners?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Firstly the conflict in Sudan is not religious. In my opinion it is a political war, because the rights of the southern Sudanese people are not granted. I stand for the political rights of all people, which in the case of South-Sudan have not been addressed since Sudan's independence in 1956, when the north and the south which are religiously and racially diverse merged.  The present government inherited the war from past regimes. The war has raged since 1955 except for 11 years between 1972 and 1983 when a peace pact was brokered between the two regions. The then President Gafer Numeiry abrogated the peace agreement of 1972, among other things by introducing Islamic Law, which particularly annoyed southern Christians. This has tended to give the war a religious dimension that has overshadowed its origins that are rooted in the demand for political rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. But why does the present government still maintain Sharia Law?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. The introduction of Sharia Islamic Law complicated an otherwise simple political problem. The political problem needed a political solution at the time of Sudan's independence, but this was not done. Issues of political and civic rights for the people of southern Sudan were not addressed. Southerners include people such as Nuba, Ingessira and others who administratively and geographically are presently not in the south. The issue is now complicated and needs to be handled cautiously, so that the number of radicals on either side does not increase. My point is that the duty of all Sudanese, including those in the Government and the SPLA, is to sit together and work for peace and reconciliation before the situation gets worse. We need to sit and discuss alone as Sudanese without interference from outside. On October 4, 1994 the Government passed a Provisional Order requiring church-related agencies to register as societies or Non-Governmental Organisation (NGOs) under the Societies Act of 1957.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. What is your opinion of this order which many churches have criticised?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. It is true this order has caused controversy between the Church and the Government. As instruments of the church these agencies are part and parcel of church establishments and their role should not be confused with the normal work of the church. The Government wishes to give legal entity to these agencies to enable them have rights and privileges for humanitarian work. The churches themselves are not required to register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. What would you consider as major achievements during your tenure in the Cabinet? A. Against a background of religious, cultural and racial diversity, I consider myself a cooling system. I facilitated the visit of Pope John Paul II to Sudan in February 1993. I also facilitated the visit of the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1994. The Archbishop is set to return to Sudan in the near future. I have also laboured for the cancellation of the Missionary Act which deprived Christians of their freedom of worship and denied them access to land for church buildings. I consider myself a symbol of unity between the north and south and between Christians and Muslims</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Nernlor Grudah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest peace accord on Liberia is most significant and extraordinary not because all the warring factions were signatories but because Nigeria, the main power player, put its thumb on the pact, thereby unlocking the long-drawn process. Although nominal in a sense, there are reasons to believe that the latest peace accord in Liberia is very likely to stick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberians who welcomed the August accord with guarded optimism did so out of disillusionment and perhaps, out of ignorance. They are disillusioned because 12 previous accords have largely been broken, and ignorant of the high-class propaganda that has made a scapegoat of the warlords and kept the bloody conflict going for more than five years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Propaganda is capable of shaping, transforming and above all, misleading international opinion, and that is what has happened in the Liberian civil war. Under the latest agreement, signed in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, on August 20, a cease-fire was expected to come into force on August 26 and a six-member transitional state council to be set up within two weeks of the signing. Democratic elections are to be held within one year following disarmament and demobilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brokered by Nigeria and Ghana, which holds the chairmanship of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the agreement was signed by all seven warring factions. They include the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), Ulimo-K, Ulimo-J, Liberia Peace Council (LPC), Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), Lofa Defence Force (LDF), and NPFL-Central Revolutionary Council (NPFL-CRC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most baffling to many Liberians, was the unanimous endorsement of a less known university professor, Wilton Sankawulo, as chairman of the new state council. He replaces the aging Chief Tamba Tailor (in his 90s) who has been presented as candidate. However, the Chief will remain a member of the council as a representative of traditional leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other members are Charles Taylor of NPFL, Alhaji Kromah of the United Liberation Movement-K (Ulimo-K), George Boley of LPC, who represents a coalition of the other factions including his, and Oscar Quiah of the Liberian National Conference, representing the civilians. The signing, overseen by ECOWAS Chairman, President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, and Nigeria's military strongman, Sani Abacha, was also witnessed by representatives of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and United Nations, which has an observer mission in Liberia. This follows Abacha's decision to break with the path taken by his predecessor, Ibrahim Babangida, and to arrange a high-profile reconciliation visit of Nigeria's erstwhile bitter foe in the conflict, Charles Taylor, to Abuja in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having made the visit, his first in five years, Taylor has since made a couple of other trips to Nigeria, culminating in the signing of the accord.  Observers see this as part of Abacha's efforts to patch up his government's battered international image because of human rights abuses and lack of commitment to return the country to democratic rule. Analysts advance that the reason why this accord will hold is that all the warring factions signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is not the first time all factions have signed a peace accord to end the civil war that has claimed more than 150,000 lives, destroyed the economy and infrastructure of Liberia and displaced half the population of nearly 3 million. The Cotonou Accord signed in Benin, in July, 1993, was by all three main factions at the time, the NPFL, ULIMO and the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) led by Dr. Amos Sawyer, which controlled the ramp AFL. It followed 10 days of intensive negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland. But that collapsed soon afterwards, because during the process, the Nigerian-led ECOWAS Monitoring Group, ECOMOG, was propping up a new faction, LPC, at the time, which refused to abide by the accord. And to make matters worse, another Nigerian-sponsored faction, Ulimo, split into two over the seating of the present transitional state council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been established by independent bodies like the UN and human rights groups that Nigeria is responsible for the heating up of all the other splinter armed groups to fight against the NPFL. Except for the NPFL-CRC led by former Taylor's Defence Minister, Tom Woewiyu, the rest of the factions are all splinter groups from the AFL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one stage, Nigeria even tried to allegedly sponsor another faction in Nimba county, the Nimba Redemption Council (NRC) - an area which is a NPFL stronghold. But that group soon fizzled out and disappeared from the scene as it lacked operation base and support among Liberian refugees in both Ivory Coast and Guinea. That would have meant brother against brother, and husband against wife (from the same ethnic groups), for it was in Nimba county that some of the most gruesome killings under the military tyranny of the late Samuel Doe took place, including the burying alive of women and children.  Based on the foregoing, one can conclude that Nigeria holds the key to ending the war in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Factions which have no popular support among the population rely on the Nigerian military presence to demand a stake in any administration. The latest developments in the Liberian crisis have also apparently been precipitated by a UN threat to withdraw its mission, UNOMIL, if the factions did not make progress to end the stalemate, disarm and set a date for general elections. Such withdrawal was expected to be effected by September 15 this year if all or some of the conditions were not met, when a UN mandate is expected to expire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is extremely difficult to justify the continuation of manpower tied to disarmament when there is no disarmament going on,&quot; UN Special Envoy to Liberia, Anthony Nyakyi, told journalists. By softening its stand, Nigeria appears to have come to terms with realities on the ground in Liberia. But the move comes too little and too late when irreparable damage has already been done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPFL remains the most representative group in the conflict and still wields widespread support among the population, although some may not be fans of its leadership. Yet it has been the arch-foe of the Nigerian-led ECOMOG, which has thrown everything into battle, unsuccessfully, to crush it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Liberians are wary of a Charles Taylor presidency for fear of his becoming another Doe, given that he (Taylor) is already alleged to have masterminded the assassination of key politicians and potential rivals, mostly from Nimba county, including Jackson Doe, David Duanyan and Moses Duopu, to name but a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically though, Taylor is not from the region, he draws the bulk of his NPFL fighters from there. The reason for enormous NPFL support is simple. All the other factions, except NPFL-CRC, are no different from the AFL; in fact, they are one and the same. Real lasting peace will come to Liberia when all foreign forces have completely withdrawn from the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Wafula John</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African indigenous churches were explained away as an &quot;overnight fad&quot; when they first emerged in Sierra Leone around 1819. This contemptuous portrayal did not, however, stop them from flourishing, sometimes as a direct counteraction to colonial administration. But decades since the demise of colonialism indigenous churches, also referred to as African Independent Churches (AICs) now estimated at 9000 with millions of followers, are a force to reckon with. Our writer explores some of the things that make AICs trick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christ saves and comforts all, but when Raymond Mukilwa, 45, first &quot;embraced the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; more distress gripped him.  What shall I do with my two wives? He wondered. Suppose he separated from one of them, as the wisdom of his church prevailed upon him, what would become of the divorced wife and her children? Whatever he did, he would always have to live with the stigma of having been polygamous. He would never rise to any position of responsibility in his church, even if he deserved it. And he, like his second wife, would never go to Communion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A haunted Mukilwa brought his distress to Sinaida Dorcas Mary Akatsa, fondly referred to as &quot;mama&quot; or &quot;the prophetess&quot;. Akatsa, a former domestic servant, is the founder of the Jerusalem Church of Christ (JCC) situated in the sprawling Kawangware area, a poor suburb of Nairobi. The prophetess boasts of over 30,000 adherents. Prophetess Akatsa's church put to rest Mukilwa's anxieties without much fuss. He was allowed to keep his two wives.  But he would be excommunicated if he added another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The JCC is one of the many African Independent Churches (AICs) that are steadily gaining popularity in sub-Saharan Africa partly because of their ability to reconcile uniquely African experiences. In earlier years, these churches were seen as a reaction against colonialism. But when they continued to flourish and even mushroom in modern times society, began to look at them more seriously. A leading African scholar, Rev. Professor John S. Mbiti, once described AICs as &quot;a messy soup&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today there are about 9,000 AICs with millions of followers estimated at 15 per cent of Africa's total Christian population. But according to some sources these estimates are too conservative since the movements are growing faster than scholars are studying them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is also reluctance to acknowledge their phenomenal growth,&quot; says Jack O. Nandi, a scholar in African indigenous religious movements and a lecturer in religion at Maseno University in Kenya. In South Africa, for example, statistics show that only 9 per cent Christians were members of indigenous churches by 1950. This figure rose to 18 per cent in 1960, 29.3 per cent in 1980 and was estimated at about 35 per cent in 1990. The World Christian Encyclopedia estimates that in the mid 80s Zaire had 4,777,500 indigenous church adherents who were expected to increase to 8,848,500 by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts now agree there must be another explanation for the constant drift of believers from the mainstream or &quot;mission planted churches&quot; to the AICs.  Apart from polygamy which many accept, a majority of these churches have built a sense of brotherhood among members not unlike the traditional extended family system or communalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many AICs also embrace and enthusiastically encourage a lively presence of the Holy Spirit and guardian angels in a manner similar to the role of, and respect traditional society paid to ancestors. Also the unique baptism, confirmation and other rituals, in some cases resembling the customary initiation ceremonies of some ethnic groups in the successive age groups, have attracted many believers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Africa Church of the Holy Spirit for instance, urge the faithful to style their worship on experiences drawn from their African traditions as long as they confirm to, or do not violate fundamental Biblical teachings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand mainstream churches have been accused of patronage, lack of understanding of the African reality, and a blind onslaught on traditional customs and practices. Where they are recognised such as the last funeral rights (inheritance) of the Baganda of Uganda, rather than fuse tradition with what is good from Christianity, the opposite appears to be the case. The church tends to take over the tradition and seek to fuse Christianity with what is good or appropriate from the tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prophesy and healing are the other major attractions of indigenous churches. The fact that their leaders lay claim to prophesy and healing is a great boon that has attracted not only Africans, but also people of different socio-cultural backgrounds including a few Asians and some Europeans. This aspect in a way conforms with the &quot;perversive religiosity&quot; of the African people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing on African spirituality, Father Renato Kizito, a well known Italian priest cum-journalist, asserts that matters that affect people such as health are fundamental concerns, that make healing a critical issue. Yet these dimensions, he writes, &quot;have been put aside by a Western spirituality preoccupied - sometimes one could say obsessed - with moral and sexual behaviour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Kizito further asserts that AICs take the spiritual and physical well-being of their adherents extremely seriously. &quot;It can be said that their very life and worship revolve around healing, visions, dreams and the overcoming of evil forces.&quot; On a continent where spirits both good and evil are a crucial component of traditional beliefs, this aspect undoubtedly appeals to many ordinary African worshippers especially when not &quot;schooled&quot; in the Western sense. However, the most binding cord of these churches is often the charisma - power to inspire devotion and enthusiasm - which their leaders often exude. This charisma is often bolstered by the often mysterious aura of their founders and leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sinaida Mary Akatsa, for example, has a very mysterious childhood tale.  Born through a cesarean birth two months pre-maturely, she came three hours after her mother had been pronounced dead. The infant Akatsa is said to have &quot;outwitted&quot; innumerable attempts at her life. Among these were poisoning, bewitching and even abandonment in a thicket for three days and nights. The worst had yet to happen. In March 1983 &quot;mummy&quot; was poisoned, &quot;died for three days and three nights&quot;, and was ordered out of heaven to come back and &quot;lead lost souls&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skeptics may be sobered by the fact that by 1993, &quot;mama&quot; Akatsa's Jerusalem Church of Christ had 11,222 registered members and over 20,000 unregistered followers in four branches in Kenya. The church boasts of a following of between 30,000 and 40,000 members countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attraction of AICs also include their fusing of indigenous elements with their worship. Worshippers are perennially active throughout a worship service, with choral singing, dancing, hand clapping and even ululations.  Often, the songs, which carry rich African tones and beats, are accompanied by such indigenous instruments as the kayamba, the horn and jingles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Julius Murikwa of Daystar University based in Nairobi, concedes that the style of preaching in indigenous churches&quot; is yet another of their attractions. The worship is &quot;active, interactive and participatory,&quot; with the preacher and congregation all taking part. It is not unusual for congregations to plunge in collective hymns, adoration, prayers and communal castigation of sin and Satan. Said Prof. Murikwa: &quot;Church services are not seen as an hourly rite where congregants listen to some sermon, absolve themselves of sin and leave. It is a communal activity of renewal which often lasts for six hours or more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more, AICs are now attempting to solve their adherent's temporal needs through a very strong bond of a mutually beneficial brotherhood among the faithful. In an African milieu where even manual jobs continuously shrink, it is no wonder that the young flock to churches like &quot;prophetess&quot; Akatsa's. In infusing this African &quot;holistic&quot; view of worship - that religion should serve the total person for spiritual and temporal nourishment - indigenous churches have greatly endeared themselves to &quot;the disoriented urban immigrant&quot;, says Prof. Murikwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps what is most puzzling is the immense power and influence which female leaders often wield in these churches contrary to male dominance in mainstream churches. The churches confer status and prominence to women, often building some into formidable prophetesses who, if not checked, can easily build personal cults. Father Kizito states that these prophetesses spring up especially when the male leadership fails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are the last resort, the last voice or possibility of protest, even violent protest, left to the poor,&quot; he concludes. Some indigenous churches' prophetesses who left an indelible mark on the African continent include prophetess Leshina of Zambia, Lakwena of Uganda and Mother Jane Bloomer of Freetown, just to name a few. Scholars say that the increasing drift of women to independent churches is also due to barrenness, delay in conception, and domestic difficulties. Many indigenous churches respond to these problems through deliberate and open healing and prayer sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps where indigenous churches score a hat-trick is their handling of the dead and the deceased. Most African communities loathe burial in communal cemeteries with the unknown. Also responsibility to the dead and the deceased is communal. So is the case in many African indigenous churches. Often the churches or members, communally meet all funeral expenses including the transportation of both corpses and mourners among other requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same is true of weddings, big hospital bills and other responsibilities that an individual, family or friends alone may not afford. One adherent put it plainly: &quot;My church is my insurance policy to a decent burial.&quot; With the growing destitution, particularly in Africa's expanding cities, many people may continue to seek supportive brotherhood and comfort in an African independent church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Professor Murikwa notes, most indigenous church leaders have very little formal education if at all. Some AICs leaders in fact, understand Bible teachings only superficially, and hence do a great disservice to their flock by misinterpreting the Holy Scriptures. &quot;Therefore there is need for Christian institutions of missiology as well as mainstream churches, to reach out to these leaders to help train them,&quot; recommends Murikwa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VATICAN CITY (APS) August 28 - As Christians, particularly Catholics in Africa look forward to the eleventh pastoral visit to Africa by Pope Paul II mid-September, the Holy See's press office has released the Pontiff's detailed itinerary. A recent dispatch from the Vatican says the Pontiff will spend two days (September 14-16) in Yaounde, Cameroon, another two in South Africa, (September 16-18), where he will travel between Johannesburg and Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 18 he is scheduled to leave Johannesburg for Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, where he is expected to stay until September 20 when he returns to the Vatican. During his visit to Africa, the Pope intends to hold concluding celebrations of the Special Synod for Africa and Madagascar, whose working sessions were held in Rome from April 10 to May 8, 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlights of the journey include celebrations of Mass and sessions of the Assembly of the Special Synod for Africa in the countries covered by the Pontiff's visit. According to the media dispatch, the visit to South Africa will be the first Papal visit to the country, while Cameroon's will be his second, having been there in 1985. Kenya will be hosting the current head of the Catholic Church for the third time as he visited the country on two previous occasions, 1980 and 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same press release, the Holy See says, the Pope will be accompanied by, among others three presidents-delegate of the African Synod, Cardinals-Francis Arinze of Nigeria; Christian Tumi of Cameroon; Paulos Tzadua of Ethiopia; Hyacinth Thiandoum of Senegal and the Secretary-General of the Synod of bishops, Jan Schotte. The Vatican dispatch says the Pope's September pastoral visit to Africa will bring to 37 the number of African countries he has so far visited, since he was enthroned as the head of the universal Roman Catholic church in 1978.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANGOCHI-MALAWI (APS) August 28 - Internal hostilities, wars and conflicts that continue to affect some African communities are incompatible with development and therefore African leaders should work towards eradicating them, a group of Catholic bishops from the East and Central African regions has cautioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clergy, drawn from Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea, and meeting here under the Catholic church's regional body of the Association of Episcopal Conferences of Eastern Africa (AMECEA) between August 6 and 20, stressed that civil strife has made development among certain communities impossible. Exemplifying Sudan and Somalia, the bishops said events in those countries have led to the uprooting of thousands of people from their homes and resulted in terrible loss of human life and property.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the role of women in development, the Catholic clergy noted that many women are bearing burdens of responsibility that are beyond their capacity, stressing that without the contribution of women, social and economic life in our nations would come to a standstill. The contribution of women needs to be recognised and economically rewarded, the bishops further stressed. They also expressed support for delegates to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China and acknowledged the struggle for their (women's) rightful place in society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic clergy, who addressed various issues pertaining to the social, economic, political and religious needs of the African people, underscored the need to make the Church central in the life of the African people. &quot;If the Church is to become the family of God in Africa, we all, clergy, religious and the laity have to learn to sit together, to look together at our situation, to listen to each other, to plan a common project and feel all responsible for realising it,&quot; stated the bishops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a Rwandese catholic bishop, invited to attend the AMECEA assembly, strongly defended his church against claims that the latter was involved in the genocide that took place in the Central African country between April and July 1994. &quot;The Catholic church is falsely accused of having a share of responsibility in the Rwandese tragedy. In fact, it is the craving for power that has led to this tragedy, while the church was incapable of defending even its own members,&quot; noted Bishop Wenceslas Kalibushi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandese clergy lamented that &quot;the numerous criticisms abusively thrown at the church in Rwanda by the national and international media do not make the moral recovery of our people any easier.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAO TOME (APS) August 28 - Soldiers who ousted Sao Tome and Principe's first democratically elected President Miguel Trovoada mid-August have handed back power under an amnesty deal worked out by Angolan Foreign Minister Nenancio de Moura. The coup leaders, who struck early on August 15 and said they had ousted President Trovoada, handed back power a week later on August 22 after they failed to win support from their countrymen and women at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ousted president resumed possession of his offices at midday on August 22 and approved an amnesty law protecting the coup leaders, which had been voted in by the national assembly a day earlier. The same day, the Sao Tome cabinet held an extraordinary meeting presided over by Prime Minister Carlos Graca, a move that indicated that a ministerial reshuffle could be in the offing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a further measure to restore order to the impoverished West African nation, one of the poorest in the world, foreign ministers from Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, as well as Sao Tome and Principe, were expected to attend a summit in Sao Tome in the coming days to discuss the country's economic, political and social situation, a source close to the Angolan Foreign Minister said. Earlier, De Moura, who helped to negotiate an end to the crisis, went on the island republic's national radio to announce that civilian rule had been restored in this country, declaring: &quot;Thanks to understanding, good sense and a spirit of patriotism shown by all sides, it has been possible to normalise political life in Sao Tome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Moura said a memorandum had been signed between the coup leaders and the civilian authorities calling for a series of measures including a restructuring of the military, but with Trovoada remaining as commander in chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources in the army, the coup leaders agreed to sign the amnesty document after getting assurance that they would neither be prosecuted, tried nor disciplined. The mutineers also obtained satisfaction in a dispute over the make-up of the presidential guard, after they were assured that the personal guard of the president would continue to be trained by officers from Sao Tome and Principe and not by foreign soldiers as the president had wanted. The signatories were coup leader Sub-Lieutenant Quintas de Almeida and the Speaker of the National Assembly, Francisco Fortunato Pires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accord came only a few hours after the National Assembly unanimously voted to amnesty those involved in the coup, thus meeting the main condition set by the soldiers before they would relinquish power. Trovoada, who was elected president in the first democratic elections since independence, was arrested and overthrown at dawn on August 15 in a bloodless coup organised by a group of officers who said they wanted to &quot;restore order&quot; to the island republic, which won independence from Portugal in 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the coup failed to win general support here or abroad, with numerous countries condemning the putsch and suspending aid desperately needed in a destitute nation where, for example, teachers earn only dollars 10 a month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FREETOWN (APS) August 28 - Delegates to Sierra Leone's National Consultative Conference voted on August 17 to postpone general elections in the West African country from December to February 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many delegates had during the three-day meeting voiced support for the original date to be maintained, but the chairman of the Interim National Electoral Commission (INEC) chairman James Jonah, a former UN under secretary-general, proposed the deferment of the elections until March 1996.  According to Jonah, the need to postpone the elections arose out of lack of funds for the poll, whose cost was estimated at US dollars 17 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is also to give time for political parties to canvass and also for the National Committee for Democracy (a UN-sponsored group) to increase their civic voter education,&quot; Jonah said after the conference closed. But the delegates voiced open opposition against Sierra Leonean rebels denouncing the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of renegade Sierra Leone army officer, Corporal Foday Sankoh for not taking part in the conference. They also called on the military government to provide security and design a security plan of action before the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling military junta, of Captain Valentine Strasser, which had the responsibility to confirm the conference's proposals, has since welcomed the proposals and is now expected to endorse the conference's proposals. But news of the postponement was greeted with mixed feelings, especially from 10 out of the 17 political parties expected to take part in the coming polls. One angry politician hit out: &quot;What is the need for the postponement? The election was one thing that could have ended the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But diplomats here, mainly from western Europe, said the postponement was necessary and they even cast doubts on the possibility of holding the elections by February. When the conference opened, only six delegates out of 70 had opted for a change of the polls date. Before the closure of the conference, Major Karefa Kargbo, the defence spokesman and a member of the military junta, had told the conference that the military government did not want to take a position on the timing of the vote, saying: &quot;We are looking up to delegates to reach a consensus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 40 per cent of Sierra Leone's 4.5 million population have been displaced by the four-year-old civil war, and despite an invitation to attend, the RUF failed to turn up. The delegates included representatives of student organisations, universities, trade unions, women's organisations, traditional chiefs and representatives of Sierra Leonean refugees currently living in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Strasser's government had promised to hand over to an elected administration in early 1996 following elections at the end of this year, but many observers felt the only form of election that could be organised would be a highly modified form of proportional representation due to the very high number of Sierra Leoneans forced to live outside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days of registration of political parties ended on August 14 with 17 provisionally registered, among them the All People's Congress (APC), the one-time sole party which was overthrown by junior officers in the April 29, 1992 coup that brought Captain Strasser's National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) to power. The war has claimed over 10,000 lives, according to official statistics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA (APS) August 28 - The capture of the southern Sudanese border town of Kaya by Sudanese troops and a new Ugandan rebel movement, the West Nile Bank Front, has increased tension between Uganda and Sudan. Kaya was previously a stronghold of the Garang faction (mainstream) of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, SPLA. The guerrillas of the SPLA fled Kaya which was taken virtually without a fight on August 12.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda's Minister of State for Defence, Amama Mbabazi told the State newspaper New Vision that there was a possibility that the capture of Kaya by Sudanese troops and the West Nile Bank Front &quot;was intended to create a platform from where the Sudan government may aid the rebel to disrupt the peace in Uganda.&quot; The West Nile Bank Front comprises former soldiers who served in the Idi Amin regime. Most members are believed to be from West Nile area. They are commanded by a one time Cabinet Minister in the Amin period, Juma Oris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda has on a number of occasions over the past year accused Sudan of sponsoring the rebels to destabilise Uganda. These accusations were directed mainly against Joseph Kony's Lords Resistance Army (LRA) which in the past engaged in acts of banditry, killings and kidnappings, mainly in Kitgum District in northern Uganda. However the LRA troops have recently been kitted in new Sudan Army uniforms and carry a heavier range of weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 23 this year following the massacre of 200 villagers in Kitgum District near the Sudan border, Uganda angrily severed diplomatic relations with Sudan and warned that it reserved the right to attack their bases inside Sudan in future. In turn Sudan accused Uganda of supporting the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspicions continued despite a meeting between Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni and President El Bashir of Sudan aimed at reconciling the two countries. The meeting, last May in Malawi was at the behest of the Malawian leader, Bakili Muluzi. Already there are reports that Ugandans are fleeing Kobiko village on the border, following persistent aerial bombing and artillery shelling by Sudanese troops and the new rebel group now in Kaya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Uganda's Defence Ministry has confirmed that government troops mid-August killed Major Oryem Lagwaramoi second in Command to Joseph Kony.  Thirteen rebels of the Lords Resistance Army also died during the pitched battle north west of Kitgum town at Obolokome. The rebels are believed to have entered Uganda from Sudan about August 15. They roamed and terrorised villagers in Palabek, Padibe, Ocettoke, Lemo Lugwar, and other villages in Kitgum before being confronted by Uganda's National Resistance Army (NRA) troops. The death of their deputy commander is believed to be a major blow to the Lords Resistance Army who are generally described as &quot;Christian fundamentalist forces&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, they carry out regular atrocities in areas that they attack and are hated by their own Acoli people. Their Commander, Joseph Kony is believed to have been injured during a rebel incursion into Uganda early this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) August 28 - Scholars meeting here recently have challenged fellow experts in Africa and elsewhere in the world to work hand-in-hand with their governments to help eradicate poverty among the affected communities.  During the Fourth World Conference of the World Future Studies Federation (WFSF) held in the Kenyan capital recently, scholars drawn from all over the world were also urged to make sure that their research work was matched with implementation. The 250 delegates to the world conference, the first to have been held on the African soil, expressed concern that in some cases, the amount of work that goes into research work was not matched with similar effort when it came to implementation. As a result, we end up having too much knowledge on paper and little and sometimes none on the practical level, the delegates, who were drawn from diversified disciplines, among them theologians, observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that poverty was on the increase among many communities in the world over, the scholars pointed out that &quot;it would be naive to abdicate that responsibility to governments&quot;. The scholars concern over poverty and its effects among the affected communities comes in the wake of reports indicating that the number of poor people is growing in the world over and particularly in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in its July report on the food situation in Africa, expressed concern that an estimated 23 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are faced with starvation as food aid declines. According to the FAO report, the largest concentration of these vulnerable populations is in Southern Africa (10 million), followed by Eastern Africa (9 million), Western Africa (3 million) and Central Africa (one million). &quot;Widespread drought has seriously undermined production in southern Africa, while persistent civil strife and security problems in some countries continue to limit farming and distribution activities,&quot; the FAO report points out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports on deteriorating famine, drought and civil strife in Africa will definitely increase poverty among communities. That is why, we, scholars, among others, should get involved towards its poverty eradication, observed South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, while delivering his key-note address at the conference. The South African clergy who is the current president of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), further urged African nations to find a lasting solution to the many problems facing the continent as a first step towards social and economic reforms. The continent's survival is threatened by all manner of social, economic and political ills and can only sustain itself if it reassesses the past with the intention of starting a new chapter, Archbishop Tutu emphasised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Tutu who addressed the conference on &quot;Accountability and Poverty in Africa&quot;, challenged Africa to make efforts to stand on its own feet as the continent is no longer a priority to the West, which he said, prefers to support the former Eastern bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, a two-day meeting, held in the Uganda capital, Kampala on the management of Science and Technology for development in Africa decried Africa's falling standards as far as self-sufficiency in food is concerned. The forum attended by some 500 delegates, among them five African Heads of State representing Zimbabwe, Uganda, Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique lamented that ineffective application of improved production technology linked to ineffective pricing and marketing and high rates of population growth had resulted in declining per capita food production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late July meeting was attended by Presidents of Zimbabwe, Uganda, Botswana, Malawi, and Mozambique. They were among the estimated 500 delegates at the two-day meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) August 28 - Bishops of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan (ECS) have appealed to the government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) to work relentlessly towards achieving honourable peace to save their people from the long-standing civil war which continues to drain human and material resources from the Sudan. Saying that they believed Sudanese are &quot;naturally peace-loving&quot; people, the bishops asked Lt. General Omar Hassan Ahmed El-Bashir, leader of the Sudanese junta and the SPLM and its army, the SPLA, to disassociate themselves from hostilities, start peace talks &quot;anywhere on earth acceptable&quot; and allow food to reach starving people in the regions they each control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter addressed to Bashir but intended for and sent to both the Sudanese President and John Garang, head of SPLM and commander of SPLA, the bishops said that &quot;freedom of evangelisation and free movement of bishops&quot; ought to be facilitated throughout the country. The letter signed by all the 20 bishops of the ECS, was issued at the end of a week-long meeting here.  Among the bishops at the August 4-12 meeting was Gabriel Roric, Bishop of Rumbeki in the south, who is also Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in Bashir's cabinet. Bishop Roric has lived in Khartoum since 1986 when Rumbeki was destroyed by fighting between SPLA fighters and government troops. He was appointed Minister in August 1992. In another development, Hassan Al-Turabi, a renown and influential Islamist leader, has said that his country had been unjustly criticised abroad because it applied Islamic laws and revived the concept of Jihad or holy struggle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turabi was quoted by the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) as saying the change which Sudan has been witnessing since the implementation of Islamic laws would take it to the position of leadership in the world. After living through the first half of this century of Western domination, Sudan had revived the concept of Jihad otherwise forgotten in the Islamic world, Turabi said. Western nations led by the United States, together with Egypt and several other Arab states have repeatedly accused Sudan, led since 1989 by the Islamist-backed government of giving refuge and training for Muslim militant groups. Sudan denies the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing achievements of Bashir's government, Turabi said the Sudanese Head of State had ended a state of disintegration under the rule of sectarianism and political parties, in reference to outlawed political groups, the Umma and the Democratic Unionist Party. Upon taking power, Bashir dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution. He also banned political parties, including Turabi's National Islamic Front, thus ending Sudan's third spell of democratic rule since independence in 1956.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Lino Rol Deng, another controversial southerner in Bashir's government, has asked the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to stop SPLA form recruiting Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries. Mr Lino Rol Deng, Secretary-General of Sudan's High Council for Peace was quoted as saying his country had also called on representatives of human rights groups to visit such camps in Uganda, Kenya and Eritrea. The government and the SPLA have accused each other of rounding up men and young boys for military training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum has accused the United Nations of turning a blind eye to SPLA round-ups.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Clive Simpkins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE collapse of Avia Airlines and the South African leg of Sudan Airways has highlighted some major flaws inthe protection of passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who had bought Sudan Airways tickets were stunned recently to learn that not only did they haveto pay a 15 percent excess on their claims, but in many instances they weren't covered at all because Sudan Airways per se continues to operate healthily. TheSouth African leg is in &quot;suspension&quot; and may be resumed later this year. However, this doesn't help thosewho've already forked out for a fare and need to travel immediately.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People don't only take out travel insurance when flying&quot;iffy&quot; airlines. I have, for years, taken out insurance whenever a fare has been one of those penalty-attracting packages which cannot easily be changed, or in case I get ill. The flaw in the present insurance system is that the risk is skewed and the insurance companies have discovered that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Airways (BA) gets a 10-out-of-10 for lending a hand to passengers in distress. BA allowed strandedpassengers special privileges on a standby basis to get'em back home. Compare this with the unbelievably insensitive and unhelpful response of South AfricanAirways' (SAA) Leon Els who said that &quot;it was their choice to fly Sudan Airways&quot;. He's just nullified a few hundred thousand rand of SAA's advertising and public relations budget in one foul swoop.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous government refused requests from theAssociation of Southern African Travel Agents (Asata)for a small levy to be imposed on all airfares to allowthe creation of a travel-industry trust or fidelityfund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market forces should have been allowed to dictate themechanisms for default-insurance procedures. I hope thepresent government will recognise this and leave decisions affecting specific industries and services tothose in the know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the subject of air travel, it's saddening to notethat airlines are going for the jugulars of oppositionairlines yet again. This certainly contributed to thedemise of Flite Star and it seems airlines are using thesame tactics to get rid of Phoenix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of trying to win passengers by offering thembetter service, some airlines seem hell-bent on thedestruction of the opposition. Competition is scary,remember?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comair's ad about its R14-million trust fund forpassenger protection focuses more on a challenge toopposition airlines to do likewise than on the meritsof its plan. It is interesting to note that SAA'sformer head marketing honcho is now at Comair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not for one moment advocating protection of somesort, just a more consumer-benefiting approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan Carlzon, the famed President of Scandinavian Airlines, says: &quot;You'll never be 50 percent better than your opposition at what you do. If they were so bad,they'd be out of business. What you've got to do is be one percent better at 1 000 little things.&quot; Travel industry please take note.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special National Intelligence briefing to the Cabineton how to deal with sensitive and potentially embarrassing information and prevent leaks has been leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern about security leaks and sabotage of government plans prompted National Intelligence to brief Cabinet on how to safeguard sensitive information. A document on safety measures was distributed in the recent Cabinet briefing, and has since then been distributedto government ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document urges civil servants to be ever-vigilant when dealing with matters that could embarrass, damage or bring down the government. In particular, it lays out guidelines for preserving confidentiality and sensitive information, which could either be contained in documents or on computers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implicit in the preamble is the warning that there maybe forces at work to sabotage the RDP and the country's transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors of the document note that there has been an&quot;escalation of intelligence activities by a growing number of foreign countries and other interest groups&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from laying down procedures for dealing with bomb attacks and fires, the document describes the differences between &quot;restricted&quot;, &quot;confidential&quot;,&quot;secret&quot; and &quot;top secret&quot; information. According to the definitions, a &quot;restricted document&quot; contains information that could embarrass the government, a&quot;confidential document&quot;, if leaked, could damage the government, a &quot;secret document&quot; might be used by opponents to disrupt the running of government and a&quot;top secret document&quot;, if leaked, could lead to the downfall of the government, the severing of relations with another state or a declaration of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top secret&quot; and &quot;secret&quot; documents have to be kept in strong rooms or vaults, where as confidential documentmust be kept in reinforced steel cabinets. The Cabinet briefing document -- a restricted document -- also contains a number of tips about keys, fires and how to deal with suspicious-looking maintenance men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moe Shaik, advisor to Deputy Minister of IntelligenceJo Nhanhla, would not confirm or deny that the Cabinet briefing took place, but he did say that National Intelligence had a responsibility to protect sensitive government information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that by compiling the report, National Intelligence was not suggesting the need for excessive secrecy. But, said Shaik, &quot;our peace and emerging democracy is fragile and needs to be protected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaik said that foreign countries were interested to see how South Africa was emerging as a democracy, andthat there were interest-brokers who might, for thei rown political or economic purposes, try to acces sconfidential information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaik said that the leakage of classified documents tothe media was a problem. He said that National Intelligence was concerned by recent fires in the RDP and Finance offices. It was speculated in the mediathat the fires could be part of a sabotage campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this attempt to tighten things up ingovernment, Parliament's security remains slack. Many parliamentarians suspect their phones may be bugged and a source in the Freedom Front said this week that therewere times when the party felt the need to sweep its caucus room for bugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A private secretary for a prominent ANC MP said tha they had the sorts of conversations on parliamentary phones &quot;that they wanted other people to hear&quot;, and the National Party said this week it had stepped up personal security over the past few weeks, &quot;because they were aware that other parties were interested in getting their hands on confidential information&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all infiltration is cloak-and-dagger. Common criminals are getting through the barriers. Sources in Parliament's catering department say they suspect that up to R60 000 worth of silver teapots, spoons andcrockery have gone missing. A parliamentary spokesman refused to confirm the figure, saying that the tea set audit was still under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Parliament's silver has been lockedaway to prevent further theft and parliamentarians are being served tea in stainless steel pots.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 25, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">byJustin Pearce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Broadcasting Corporation will lose one of its three television channels at the end of1997, to make room for South Africa's first privately owned, free commercial television broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC will, however, retain its present three channels until then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent business concerns will have the opportunity to put in proposals for broadcasting rights on the third channel, leading to the establishment of SouthAfrica's first terrestial commercial TV channel in1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These guidelines form part of the Independent Broadcasting Authority's report on the future of theSABC in the context of a restructured broadcasting industry in South Africa, handed to Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Dr Pallo Jordan last week. It has not yet been tabled in Parliament, though details of the report were leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is the conclusion of the IBA's TripleEnquiry into the functions of the SABC and regulationsfor cross-ownership and local content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the hearings which informed the writing of the IBA report, the SABC argued that it would have to retain three TV channels if it were to fulfil its responsibilities as a public service broadcaster catering for 11 language communities, and still include enough entertainment material to make the service partly self-financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final set of hearings, however, the SABC conceded that it might be able to relinquish one of its channels after a consolidation period. It appears that the IBA -- which in terms of the Broadcasting Act has a responsibility to preserve the viability of the national PSB (public service broadcasting) service --has taken its lead from this eleventh-hour concession by the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC will retain a monopoly on free terrestrial television and its advertising revenue for the next two-and-a-half years, before the handover of the third wave band to a private company. After 1998, according to the document in the hands of the M&amp;G, the SABC will also have, &quot;in all probability&quot;, a licence for one satellite service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The television services of the former homelands will be merged into these SABC services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is likely to be some debate over the time scale,with impatient aspirant broadcasters wanting to enter the market sooner, but others arguing that 28 months is a reasonable minimum period of time for the SABC to consolidate its finances, for business interests to prepare their proposals for the new channel, for the IBA to consider these proposals, and for the chosen broadcaster to set up the new station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time scale gives satellite broadcasters almost two-and-a-half years in which to establish their audience with only the SABC and M-Net as competition. Some commentators believe this will allow satellite television to gain dominance in the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1998, the IBA will also consider &quot;the financial viability of introducing a second private channel,either nationally or regionally&quot;, but argues that there are limited resources in the country and &quot;there will, of necessity, for the foreseeable future, be a limited number of television stations licensed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA argues that by ensuring these stations are&quot;high quality and distinctly South African&quot;, they will be better placed to compete against foreign satellite sand to encourage foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will now be up to Jordan to prepare legislation to go before Parliament, which will enable the transfer of the licence to broadcast on the third channel, as well as a certain quantity of SABC assets, into private hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the IBA eventually considers business proposals for the commercial station, it is likely that the submissions will have to meet a strict set of criteria as conditions for the granting of a licence. According to the document, the public service responsibilities of the SABC will be shared with other TV channels,including commercial terrestrial, satellite and community TV stations. All television licensees will have to &quot;make some appropriate contribution to addressing the needs of the South African public&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ownership of the company chosen as the broadcaster for the third channel will, in all probability, be required to include a substantial number of&quot;historically disadvantaged&quot; South Africans, in order to prevent established foreign and South Africanb usiness dominating what is likely to be an extremely lucrative business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model outlined in the document given to the M&amp;G has been described as one which &quot;regulates for quality rather than for money&quot;. The guidelines are likely to come in for criticism from those who favour thep roliferation of purely commercial broadcasting in South Africa -- which some believe is the best way to encourage foreign investment in the local broadcasting industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the overall proposals will find favour with those who support the existence of a strong, though pruned-down and independent, public service broadcaster.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 25, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Clive Simpkins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE collapse of Avia Airlines and the South African leg of Sudan Airways has highlighted some major flaws inthe protection of passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who had bought Sudan Airways tickets were stunned recently to learn that not only did they haveto pay a 15 percent excess on their claims, but in many instances they weren't covered at all because Sudan Airways per se continues to operate healthily. TheSouth African leg is in &quot;suspension&quot; and may be resumed later this year. However, this doesn't help thosewho've already forked out for a fare and need to travel immediately.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People don't only take out travel insurance when flying&quot;iffy&quot; airlines. I have, for years, taken out insurance whenever a fare has been one of those penalty-attracting packages which cannot easily be changed, or in case I get ill. The flaw in the present insurance system is that the risk is skewed and the insurance companies have discovered that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Airways (BA) gets a 10-out-of-10 for lending a hand to passengers in distress. BA allowed strandedpassengers special privileges on a standby basis to get'em back home. Compare this with the unbelievably insensitive and unhelpful response of South AfricanAirways' (SAA) Leon Els who said that &quot;it was their choice to fly Sudan Airways&quot;. He's just nullified a few hundred thousand rand of SAA's advertising and public relations budget in one foul swoop.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous government refused requests from theAssociation of Southern African Travel Agents (Asata)for a small levy to be imposed on all airfares to allowthe creation of a travel-industry trust or fidelityfund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market forces should have been allowed to dictate themechanisms for default-insurance procedures. I hope thepresent government will recognise this and leave decisions affecting specific industries and services tothose in the know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the subject of air travel, it's saddening to notethat airlines are going for the jugulars of oppositionairlines yet again. This certainly contributed to thedemise of Flite Star and it seems airlines are using thesame tactics to get rid of Phoenix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of trying to win passengers by offering thembetter service, some airlines seem hell-bent on thedestruction of the opposition. Competition is scary,remember?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comair's ad about its R14-million trust fund forpassenger protection focuses more on a challenge toopposition airlines to do likewise than on the meritsof its plan. It is interesting to note that SAA'sformer head marketing honcho is now at Comair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not for one moment advocating protection of somesort, just a more consumer-benefiting approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan Carlzon, the famed President of Scandinavian Airlines, says: &quot;You'll never be 50 percent better than your opposition at what you do. If they were so bad,they'd be out of business. What you've got to do is be one percent better at 1 000 little things.&quot; Travel industry please take note.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 25, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special National Intelligence briefing to the Cabineton how to deal with sensitive and potentially embarrassing information and prevent leaks has been leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern about security leaks and sabotage of government plans prompted National Intelligence to brief Cabinet on how to safeguard sensitive information. A document on safety measures was distributed in the recent Cabinet briefing, and has since then been distributedto government ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document urges civil servants to be ever-vigilant when dealing with matters that could embarrass, damage or bring down the government. In particular, it lays out guidelines for preserving confidentiality and sensitive information, which could either be contained in documents or on computers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implicit in the preamble is the warning that there maybe forces at work to sabotage the RDP and the country's transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors of the document note that there has been an&quot;escalation of intelligence activities by a growing number of foreign countries and other interest groups&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from laying down procedures for dealing with bomb attacks and fires, the document describes the differences between &quot;restricted&quot;, &quot;confidential&quot;,&quot;secret&quot; and &quot;top secret&quot; information. According to the definitions, a &quot;restricted document&quot; contains information that could embarrass the government, a&quot;confidential document&quot;, if leaked, could damage the government, a &quot;secret document&quot; might be used by opponents to disrupt the running of government and a&quot;top secret document&quot;, if leaked, could lead to the downfall of the government, the severing of relations with another state or a declaration of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top secret&quot; and &quot;secret&quot; documents have to be kept in strong rooms or vaults, where as confidential documentmust be kept in reinforced steel cabinets. The Cabinet briefing document -- a restricted document -- also contains a number of tips about keys, fires and how to deal with suspicious-looking maintenance men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moe Shaik, advisor to Deputy Minister of IntelligenceJo Nhanhla, would not confirm or deny that the Cabinet briefing took place, but he did say that National Intelligence had a responsibility to protect sensitive government information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that by compiling the report, National Intelligence was not suggesting the need for excessive secrecy. But, said Shaik, &quot;our peace and emerging democracy is fragile and needs to be protected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaik said that foreign countries were interested to see how South Africa was emerging as a democracy, andthat there were interest-brokers who might, for thei rown political or economic purposes, try to acces sconfidential information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaik said that the leakage of classified documents tothe media was a problem. He said that National Intelligence was concerned by recent fires in the RDP and Finance offices. It was speculated in the mediathat the fires could be part of a sabotage campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this attempt to tighten things up ingovernment, Parliament's security remains slack. Many parliamentarians suspect their phones may be bugged and a source in the Freedom Front said this week that therewere times when the party felt the need to sweep its caucus room for bugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A private secretary for a prominent ANC MP said tha they had the sorts of conversations on parliamentary phones &quot;that they wanted other people to hear&quot;, and the National Party said this week it had stepped up personal security over the past few weeks, &quot;because they were aware that other parties were interested in getting their hands on confidential information&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all infiltration is cloak-and-dagger. Common criminals are getting through the barriers. Sources in Parliament's catering department say they suspect that up to R60 000 worth of silver teapots, spoons and crockery have gone missing. A parliamentary spokesman refused to confirm the figure, saying that the tea set audit was still under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Parliament's silver has been locked away to prevent further theft and parliamentarians are being served tea in stainless steel pots.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 25, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">byJustin Pearce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Broadcasting Corporation will lose one of its three television channels at the end of1997, to make room for South Africa's first privately owned, free commercial television broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC will, however, retain its present three channels until then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent business concerns will have the opportunity to put in proposals for broadcasting rights on the third channel, leading to the establishment of SouthAfrica's first terrestial commercial TV channel in1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These guidelines form part of the Independent Broadcasting Authority's report on the future of theSABC in the context of a restructured broadcasting industry in South Africa, handed to Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Dr Pallo Jordan last week. It has not yet been tabled in Parliament, though details of the report were leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is the conclusion of the IBA's TripleEnquiry into the functions of the SABC and regulationsfor cross-ownership and local content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the hearings which informed the writing of the IBA report, the SABC argued that it would have to retain three TV channels if it were to fulfil its responsibilities as a public service broadcaster catering for 11 language communities, and still include enough entertainment material to make the service partly self-financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final set of hearings, however, the SABC conceded that it might be able to relinquish one of its channels after a consolidation period. It appears that the IBA -- which in terms of the Broadcasting Act has a responsibility to preserve the viability of the national PSB (public service broadcasting) service --has taken its lead from this eleventh-hour concession by the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC will retain a monopoly on free terrestrial television and its advertising revenue for the next two-and-a-half years, before the handover of the third wave band to a private company. After 1998, according to the document in the hands of the M&amp;G, the SABC will also have, &quot;in all probability&quot;, a licence for one satellite service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The television services of the former homelands will be merged into these SABC services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is likely to be some debate over the time scale,with impatient aspirant broadcasters wanting to enter the market sooner, but others arguing that 28 months is a reasonable minimum period of time for the SABC to consolidate its finances, for business interests to prepare their proposals for the new channel, for the IBA to consider these proposals, and for the chosen broadcaster to set up the new station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time scale gives satellite broadcasters almost two-and-a-half years in which to establish their audience with only the SABC and M-Net as competition. Some commentators believe this will allow satellite television to gain dominance in the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1998, the IBA will also consider &quot;the financial viability of introducing a second private channel,either nationally or regionally&quot;, but argues that there are limited resources in the country and &quot;there will, of necessity, for the foreseeable future, be a limited number of television stations licensed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA argues that by ensuring these stations are&quot;high quality and distinctly South African&quot;, they will be better placed to compete against foreign satellite sand to encourage foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will now be up to Jordan to prepare legislation to go before Parliament, which will enable the transfer of the licence to broadcast on the third channel, as well as a certain quantity of SABC assets, into private hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the IBA eventually considers business proposals for the commercial station, it is likely that the submissions will have to meet a strict set of criteria as conditions for the granting of a licence. According to the document, the public service responsibilities of the SABC will be shared with other TV channels,including commercial terrestrial, satellite and community TV stations. All television licensees will have to &quot;make some appropriate contribution to addressing the needs of the South African public&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ownership of the company chosen as the broadcaster for the third channel will, in all probability, be required to include a substantial number of&quot;historically disadvantaged&quot; South Africans, in order to prevent established foreign and South Africanb usiness dominating what is likely to be an extremely lucrative business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model outlined in the document given to the M&amp;G has been described as one which &quot;regulates for quality rather than for money&quot;. The guidelines are likely to come in for criticism from those who favour thep roliferation of purely commercial broadcasting in South Africa -- which some believe is the best way to encourage foreign investment in the local broadcasting industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Aka Mbikusita-Lewanika</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECURITY means more than AK-47 guns in the hands of soldiers and police officers protecting the minority in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no real security where the majority are used as misguided and abused voters, to be cheated at election time and then forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's rulers and others have understood this. Thus they over-reacted again over some commonly understood pronouncement by certain politicians regarding military coups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The place of violence and the military in politics is not yet an irrelevant topic in Africa. And we cannot afford to ignore it in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present governments of Uganda, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Rwanda are the'possible' cases in Africa which 'may' be categorised as arising out of just revolutionary forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most other African governments, both the military and the so-called civilian ones, better fit the category of unjust and reactionary regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence of the former is more legitimate than of the latter, although in all cases non-violent struggle is both preferred and superior to violence of any kind and certainly to military coups in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence is a corrupting and counter-productive means of struggle, even in a just war. The physical wounds and deaths in its wake can hardly ever be healed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The option to make the struggle peaceful or violent is always in the hands of the defenders of unjust status quos and campaigners for the prevention of the coming of the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can be no lasting security where the majority are economically, socially and culturally insecure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late Dr David Simonda prophetically noted that telephone tapping, eavesdropping, intimidation, false arrests, harassment by security officers and overcrowded and unhygienic prison conditions are crimes against society.  He has written that: &quot;Where such crimes are committed against society, individual members of society do not feel obliged to defend and respect the institutions used for the same oppressive purpose. They will find a way of either neutralising or even destroying such institutions. The ultimate result is crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resorting to brutalising suspects, without due civilised legal process,w ill never control this crime culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a state in which even persons in responsible positions can abusep ublic offices and even endanger lives in a whole sub-continent through dealings in dangerous drugs. It arises out of the reactionary, hypocritical and uncontrolled nature of the present governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zambia, for example, it has sometimes been recommended, even at the ministerial level, that poor people suspected of crime or caught up in compromising situations be shot dead on sight. But for the rich and powerful, the walls of protection reach up to the summit of some nationalauthorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where the precious images of ministers and members of parliament are suspected to have been soiled in the press, a law established a quickservice special express court for political leaders. Crimes most likely tobe committed by the wealthy and political-business classes are cushionedfor velvet high-class treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nominal African governments have gladly inherited oppressive laws, and even added new ones, as a substitute for better orienting, financing, equipping,training, motivating and expanding law enforcement agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new multi-party Zambia is not markedly exempt from these criminal assaults against human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This situation calls for real fundamental change throughout our country and continent. These false starts and counterfeit leaders have provided for what the late Simonda called the &quot;political justification of criminal acts by powerful figures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only justice, fairness and democracy can prevent political and social violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The starting point in the case of Zambia today is to have a good constitution, a good leadership and a good national development programme,on which scores we are still failing dangerously.</SPAN></P>

Police action follows protests from Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda that Wezi was in possession of state security documents and wondered if he was in order to table them before parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaker Robinson Nabulyato ruled in favour of the Vice-President and warned he could waive parliamentary immunity and hand over Wezi to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately, Inspector General of police Francis Ndlovu applied to the Speaker to waive Wezi's prosecution immunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It now appears like the Speaker has waived my immunity. But I have not been informed at all,&quot; Wezi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics have charged that the police action implicated the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the plot is not there, why are the papers being classified as statesecurity documents ?&quot; asked former member of parliament and Lusaka lawyerJohn Mulwila. &quot;Police were running away from the real issue. They should investigate the strength of the allegations made by Wezi and his father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zambia Civic Education Association chairperson Lucy Sichone also came out in support of Wezi saying: &quot; It was the role of parliament to check the excesses of the executive and Nabulyato was wrong to have ruled Wezi out of order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
