<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission yesterday ordered the halting of raising aid underway in some localities to victims of overflowing Awash River as the government has the capacity to deal with the flood crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Simon Mechal said, in a statement he gave to newsmen, the government has so far provided 8,445 quintals of food and 1,000 blankets as well as house utensils to flood victims encamped at Boka, Didmtu, Choka, Alemtena and Gefersa in Wonji and Koka as well as Methara, Amibara, Dubit, Tefki, Dulecha and Buremudaitu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Commission's central warehouses in Nazareth, combolacha and Dire Dawa are stocked with 702,614 quintals of wheat, biscuit and enriched FAFA flour.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compared to the small amount of emergency relief distributed so far, the food reserve is enough even for other purpose, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Simon said the food was reserved to give prompt response to emergency situations anticipated particularly for this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if deemed necessary, we can borrow food from the national food security reserve administration, but the situation on hand do not push us to go that far,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the government has made no appeal for aid to the Awash River flood crisis, although the cost of the damage done to both human and property could be no means be considered low, Ato Simon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added eventhough philanthropists and aid agencies have volunteered to render assistance, the government did not accept the offer as the situation had not gone out of its control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless the government appeals for aid attempts being made in Methara, Wonji and Nazareth to raise assistance to flood victims is illegal, the commissioner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Simon said more than 131,000 sacks were also sent to Wonji, Nazareth and Awassa for the reinforcement of flood protection and bunkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a committee comprising different offices in the Middle and Lower Awash Basin was set to carry out disaster prevention activities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - President of the Zambia Air Lines Pilots Association (ZALPA), Captain Derrick Luembe, has supported the call by South African pilots for African governments to improve air-traffic management over their air spaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to yesterday's issue of the South African Sunday Times , the Airlines Pilots' Association of South Africa (ALPA-SA) president, Captain Tony Van Heerden, warned that the lack of adequate radar and air-traffic control over Africa could lead to mid-air collisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Van Heerden's warning comes days after a South African aviation magazine reported a recent near miss in which three aircraft, with cruising speeds of 1,600 km per hour, passed within a few hundred metres of each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is inadequate air-traffic control over Africa,&quot; Captain Luembe said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only reason there hasn't been a mid-air collision so far is because of the pilots' professionalism. They know the deficiencies and they tend to be more careful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Captain Luembe, most navigation beacons in Africa, especially the region north of Zimbabwe, are out of service and instrument landing systems often do not work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Near misses between airliners are the order of the day and the growing traffic over Africa is increasing the risk as the broadcast frequency is being over-loaded,&quot; Captain Luembe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was supported by another pilot, Alfred Mwenda, who said the only reason why a major disaster has been averted thus far is the International Air Transport Association (IATA) frequency known in airline parlance as &quot;126 decimal 9&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pilots are now relying on the IATA frequency, 126 decimal 9, to maintain separation,&quot; Mwenda claimed, explaining: &quot;It (the frequency) has become more or less the de facto controlling frequency in Africa. Pilots use this frequency for collision avoidance and safe aircraft separation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Zambian Express Airways pilot, who however declined to be named, said another problem is &quot;under- trained, overworked and demoralised air-traffic controllers using dangerously obsolete and poorly maintained equipment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALPA-SA has refused to name the countries most at fault, but it has said that, with the exception of Egypt and Morocco, all flight information regions north of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, as well as east of South Africa as far as Perth airspace, are &quot;critically deficient&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is little or no radar or Very High Frequency radio coverage over Africa north of Zimbabwe&quot; Captain Van Heerden is quoted as saying, adding: &quot; Most of the continent is dangerously lacking in anything approaching the definition of reasonable in terms of aviation aids. The problem can no longer be tolerated as it is a threat to the pilots and their passengers lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Van Heerden indicated that if this situation continues, South African pilots might consider re-routing flights between Europe and South Africa &quot;along the sanction-era route around the bulge of Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Near misses between airliners are occuring with monotonous regularity and the growing traffic over Africa is increasing the risk,&quot; Captain Van Herdeen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Airways (SAA) executive manager for flight operations, Captain Peter Cooke, is quoted as having confirmed this week that near misses were being recorded and warned that his airline might consider re-routing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Changes have to take place or we may have to consider re-routing around the bulge of Africa again,&quot; he said, advising: &quot;Overflying airlines need to get together to form a united front against deficient African countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years ago, the Zambian government with assistance from the Japanese government, installed a radar system at the Lusaka International Airport but it is yet to be commissioned because the air traffic controllers are allegedly still under training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the time it (the radar system) becomes operational, it will be obsolete and the whole purpose of installing it would have been defeated,&quot; Captain Luembe observed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - The chairman of Zimbabwe's public service commission, Mariyawanda Nzuwah, accused of incompetence in dealing with the ongoing civil servants strike, has been called upon to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the call, the affirmative action group (AAG) president, Philip Chiyangwa, said in a statement Tuesday his organisation was concerned by the apparent lack of &quot;both competence and commitment to the protection of government credibility displayed by the PSC chairman, Nzuwah, in his handling of the current dispute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The salaries dispute has cost the government millions of dollars through lost revenue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil servants went on strike more than two weeks ago, demanding salary increments of up to 60 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean economists estimate the strike had cost the government over zd 1 billion (100 million U.S. dollars) in lost revenue, mainly through uncollected taxes, as well as customs and excise duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiyangwa said the dismissal of Nzuwah and officials at the PSC would help government &quot;arrest the vast economic costs and human suffering resulting from the strike and avoid a recurrence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The AAG deplores the arrogant adherence to legalistic smokescreens that the public service commission has displayed as its only response to the expressions of genuine grievances by its employees,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiyangwa urged striking civil servants to immediately suspend their action and resume work as the costs and burdens of the strike were being disproportionately borne by the black people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The AAG urges and requests the government to immediately extend to its employees an understanding that it will resume negotiations over disputed matters in good faith, and that there will be no victimization by way of either dismissal or other disciplinary action against strikers, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the cabinet was on Tuesday morning expected to decide whether or not to rescind a decision to fire an estimated 7,000 workers who ignored an earlier order to return to work.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - The African romance of the year - between President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Graca Machel, widow of former Mozambican President Samora Machel -- has been confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the South African leader has revealed that President Mandela is in love with Mrs. Machel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to comment on weekend reports that there was a relationship between the two, presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said: &quot;All I can say is the story is not untrue, but I am not aware of any marriage plans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the couple had confirmed their relationship, and would spend as much time as possible together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weekend reports quoted sources close to President Mandela as saying that, after months of speculation, it could now be confirmed that he and Graca Machel were involved in a steady relationship and were ready to go public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They do not intend to marry, the reports add, but Mrs. Machel will spend two weeks of every month with Mandela at his home in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of a romance began early last year, and they have since been seen together during trips to Paris and Harare. Speculation was fuelled two weeks ago, when President Mandela was seen kissing Mrs. Machel at the wedding of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambican leaders and Machel's family elders have given their blessing to the relationship, and here in South Africa public figures, political leaders and the public have generally come out in favour of the news of President Mandela's romance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 78-year-old South African leader, whose marriage to Winnie Mandela began deteriorating soon after his release from prison in early 1990, was divorced earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Machel's late husband Samora Machel was killed in a plane crash in October 1986.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South Africa plans to launch a 1.3- billion-U.  S.-dollar expansion programme at its three international and six national airports between now and the turn of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its annual report tabled in parliament in Cape town, the Airports Company said that, compared with capital expenditure of about 22 million dollars in the past year, it would have to accelerate its capital development programme to around 300 million dollars per annum in the next four years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major element of this expansion would be the preparation of Cape town's air facilities for the possible hosting of the Olympic Games in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If South Africa wins its bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games,&quot; the report said, &quot;the effect on Cape Town International Airport will be dramatic. It will bring forward by ten years the anticipated traffic flow. In other words, in less than ten years Cape Town International will have to develop facilities to handle at least 200 percent more passengers than it is managing today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, Johannesburg International Airport is to be vastly extended, while Durban International Airport will be doubled in size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Developments planned for 1996 include additional parking and retail facilities at Johannesburg, a major freight park at Cape Town, a large industrial site for long-term future development at Durban, and a terminus upgrade at East London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, sites for both hotels and service stations are being identified at each of country's nine international and national airports.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty-one of the firms will be sold by the end of September, increasing to 78 by the end of 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, petrol and diesel fuel prices in Tanzania were increased by up to 4.35 percent at the weekend. The Tanzanian Petroleum Development Corporation says that this increase reflects higher world oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premium petrol now costs 360 shillings (58 U.S. cents) a litre - up from 345 shillings. Diesel costs 285 shillings (46 cents) up from 276 shillings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - Anglo-American Corporation (AAC), which is bidding to invest into Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), under the company's proposed privatization programme, has rejected recommendations by consultants to sell the company's power generating units as separate units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest issue of Business Line, a journal of the Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) quoted ACC officials as saying that such an arrangement would make mining more expensive due to possible high electricity tariffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The corporation has instead proposed to undertake its own independent study of how best to harmonize the investment programme in the industry to minimize operational costs by private investors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian government recently approved recommendations by Merchant Bank N.  M Rothchild which suggested that ZCCM power-generating units should be sold separately from the mining divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACC has offered to lead a consortium of foreign investors in the 600- million- dollar copper-mining project at the Konkola Mine Deep in the Northern Copperbelt region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACC chairman Julian Thompson was quoted as saying that offering ZCCM's electricity companies to separate investors would cause other mine operators to pay dearly for the power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from copper-mining, ZCCM also operates power-generation units under the Zambia Power Company (ZPC), a subsidiary responsible for supplying power to the various mining divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, government rejected a similar report by other international consultants who had recommended to sell ZCM in separate units. It has since set up an inter-sectoral committee comprising government and mine officials to liaise with foreign experts on the best mode of undertaking the company's privatization process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government of President Frederick Chiluba has said that it intended to fully privatize the mining industry, the country's major foreign exchange earner, by 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZCCM officials have over the recent past reported operational problems, caused mainly by obsolete equipment and inadequate capitalization which have led to a slump in copper production.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - Ethiopia exported a record 102,000 tons of coffee during the 1995-96 fiscal year ending June, earning the country 279.5 million U.S. dollars, the ministry of trade said at the weekend. But the amount was some 30 million dollars less than what the crop earned the previous year, when 30,000 tons more of the green beans were sold, Tesfaye Biftu, Minister in charge of trade and finance, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biftu was speaking here, during the annual coffee exporters' day at which private companies and the government agency that contributed to the record export figure were honored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the decline in the world coffee price is expected to continue next year, Ethiopia hopes to earn close to 240 million dollars from an envisaged export of 108,000 tons of coffee in the 1996-97 farming season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister exhorted coffee exporters to encourage the use of modern cleaning and processing machines to maintain the quality of Ethiopian export coffee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the government is giving due attention for export promotion next year to earn more hard currency from coffee, hides and skins, oil seeds, textiles and garments and fresh flowers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although coffee accounts for 60 percent for Ethiopia's annual foreign currency earnings, about two-thirds of the green beans the country produces are consumed locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its total production in 1995-96 was an all-time high of 300,000 tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials attribute the high production to the free market policies introduced five years allowing coffee farmers to sell their beans in the open market, instead of going through the state produce marketing board set up by the Marxist regime which was ousted from power 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia is also among the highest per head consumers of coffee in the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya - The leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, has said he wants to create a third political force to help African Americans and other minorities in the United States become more active in politics, particularly during elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farrakhan, an African American, told reporters Monday in Tripoli that the force would not be a political party but one designed to help influence the direction of U.S. policy on Africa and the rest of Islamic world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Black people will, sooner or later, be entitled to have their say in United States policy,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. government, he said, was frightened by the increasing political and financial clout of African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farrakhan was in Tripoli to attend the 27th anniversary of the Libyan revolution which brought Col. Moammar Kadhafi to power. The ceremony, whose highlight was the launching of the second stage of Libya 's artificial river, was attended by five other African heads of states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that increasingly, over the past 30 years, there were businessmen and wealthy persons in the African American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are also more black politicians in the government than before,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he said, since most minorities usually vote democrat, President Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee for the November presidential elections, should take this fact into consideration in shaping his policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farrakhan said that by the end of September, he would organize a rally and focus on the role African Americans, Asians and poor whites should play during the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioned on what should be done to lift the blockades against Islamic countries such as Libya, Iraq, Iran and Sudan, he said that the Arabs would first have to end their division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for Cuba, he said, all countries targeted by the U.S. were Muslim ones. That, he said, reflected United States fear of Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ample evidence of this existed in a book written by former U.S. President Richard Nixon, Farrakhan said. He cited Nixon's assertion that the Western world was more endangered by Islam than by Communism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria - Iraqi Information Minister, Ghani Abdul Ghafour, called Tuesday for international condemnation of the latest military attack by the United States against his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghafour, who is attending the Fifth Information Ministers Conference of the 113-nation Non-Aligned Movement, criticized what he called &quot;American military aggression and hegemony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the conference, in the Nigerian capital Abuja, to condemn in its communique the U.S. action which he said had resulted in unspecified &quot; civilian casualties.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States warships and airplanes fired 27 cruise missiles against Iraqi targets Tuesday, in retaliation for Baghdad's attack on Kurds in northern Iraq. Washington said that Sadam Hussein's attack against the Kurds was a violation of U.N. resolutions imposed after Iraq's defeat, by a U.S.-led coalition force, in the 1991 Gulf War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ghafour said the U.S. bombing Tuesday violated the territorial integrity of Iraq and respect for human rights which is often cited by Washington as the basic measure of what is civilized behavior by governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where are the human rights when American planes are bombing Iraqi children, women and residential areas?, he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghafour said Iraq would continue to resist what he called the &quot;American aggression and colonialism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack on Iraq was the third since the end of the Gulf war, sparked by Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaring the conference open earlier, Nigerian head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, urged the non-aligned countries to close ranks and reinforce their bonds of cooperation at all levels to counter the negative portrayal of developing nations by western media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should give impetus to the demand for a more equitable world information order,&quot; Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, focusing on the revitalization of NAM information and communication agencies, ends Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha told the participants to intensify research into information technology to redress the &quot;disequilibrium in the world information order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Represented by his deputy Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya, Abacha said the Non- Aligned Movement, or NAM, should strengthen South-South cooperation at different international organizations and encourage effective media networking for sustainable development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the challenges faced by member countries, he said, were the enormous cost and rapid changes in information technologies of the third world being created by the western media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the obvious constraints, Abacha said developing countries should no longer be mere observers but active participants in efforts, &quot;at correcting the distorted picture...being created by the western media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the 80 delegations, including 27 information ministers, to translate into reality the vision of the founding fathers of the 113-nation NAM, which came into existence some 35 years ago during the cold war era.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONROVIA, Liberia - Africa's first female head of state, Ruth Perry, was sworn-In Tuesday as the head of Liberia's six-member Council of State, or government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was elected unanimously at a meeting in August in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, by Liberia's warring factions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">That meeting, a summit of the Economic Community of West African States Committee of Nine on Liberia, was another of a long line of efforts to bring permanent peace to Africa's oldest republic after just over six years of civil war. She replaced Wilton Sankawulo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at Perry's inaugural ceremony, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said Tuesday in Monrovia that West African leaders were determined to end the perennial cycle of derailed peace plans for Liberia. Ikimi warned the warring factions against testing this resolve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Perry as chairwoman of the council, he told the warring parties that sanctions agreed upon at the Abuja summit would be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The determination now exists for them to be applied under any circumstance of definite obstruction to the peace plan,&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the various unsuccessful attempts by West African leaders to bring peace to Liberia saying this was due to the lack of cooperation from factional leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on Liberians to support Perry, urging the new chairwoman to be &quot; neutral, dispassionate, evenhanded and fair-minded&quot; in all her dealings to ensure the faithful implementation of the Abuja Peace Agreement on Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi urged Liberians to &quot;resolve to forge a sustained consensus for peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perry was a senator during the regime of late Liberian President Samuel Doe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Justice Minister Dullah Omar is confident that several key laws to curb the easy pickings made by embezzlers, thieves, insider traders, and fraudsters will be in place before year-end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will be the culmination of a process we started two years ago to review our legal system because we inherited many laws that are hopelessly inadequate to deal with crime,&quot; he says. Omar believes this is one of the main reasons for South Africa's high crime rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the process took so long because &quot;we started off with nothing and had to examine laws of different countries abroad first so that we stay in line with the latest trends. Ultimately, we will even surpass the Vienna Convention with our laws,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament has been asked to prioritise these bills to ensure they are passed before the end of this session. The bills tabled in parliament this week include the Proceeds of Crime bill, which criminalises money laundering and allows the state to seize assets bought with funds from criminal activities; the International Co- operation in Criminal Matters bill and the Extradition Amendment bill -- aimed at bringing South Africa in line with international efforts to stamp out drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals confirmed that former inspectors of foreign exchange controls in his staff were to be redeployed to facilitate the administration of the new money laundering laws. He added that it was possible these new posts would be operational before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts believe most of the staff and equipment at the South African Reserve Bank previously involved in administering exchange control regulations will be redeployed to form one of the main new structures to combat money laundering -- the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) -- in line with recommendations made by the South African Law Commission (SALC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FIC will oversee the reporting and initial investigation of suspicious transactions in the banks and other financial institutions; in addition, a Money Laundering Control Board will be set up to revise and control money laundering laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Law Commission's proposals to the Justice Ministry, attorneys, accountants, executors, estate agents, dealers in securities, insurers and insurance brokers, unit trust schemes, banks, stokvels, gambling institutions, dealers in bullion, travellers' cheques and money orders will have to appoint officers, who will in turn report &quot;suspicious transactions&quot; to the FIC, which will pass on the information to the police where necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The considerable costs of setting up and running these structures will initially be borne by the government, but in time will be covered by the provisions of the Proceeds from Crime Act. This will ensure that assets seized from the estates of drug pedlars and all other criminal activities will be used to fund the system to combat crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart Grobler of the Council of South African Banks, one of the organisations that made submissions to the law commission proposals, sees the new laws covering far more than just drug lords and robbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said even most small businesses that are not registered with the taxman, as well as foreign exchange manipulators and fraudsters, are effectively engaged in money laundering, but since this practice has never been illegal in South Africa, they get away unchecked in too many cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Grobler, like many other experts, says it is not possible to estimate the extent of money laundering, because &quot;nobody keeps records of any of the ill-begotten funds as they get deposited into the financial system&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Pieter Smit, a researcher at the SALC, says: &quot;There is already a lot of criminal (laundered) money in the South African financial system. It is hard to say how large the amount is, but the banking sector is aware of suspicious transactions going through the system, including monies coming into and out of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) publication states that the globalisation of the world economy and the growing efficiency of capital markets allows individuals and firms to shift vast sums of money freely between countries. Although difficult to measure, the magnitude of the sums involved and the extent of the criminal activities that generate this &quot;income&quot; have implications for both the domestic economy and the allocation of international resources and macro-economic stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Quirk and Vito Tanzi, of the IMF, claim their research proves money laundering can corrupt parts of the financial system and undermine governance of central banks. Other major macro- economic effects include the destabilisation of interest rates, budget deficits brought about by large- scale tax evasion, as well as the creation of financial &quot;black&quot; markets where strict exchange controls are in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once a bank manager is corrupted, non- market behaviour can spread into areas other than those directly related to the money laundering, which undermines the safety and soundness of the bank,&quot; says Quirk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money laundering and measures to counter it have, therefore, become the focus of intense international attention. Last week's Southern African Development Community meeting in Maseru, Lesotho, saw the heads of its 12 member states signing a Protocol on Combating Illicit Drug Trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar said the protocol will afford mutual assistance among the member states, including co-operation on the communication of information, taking evidence, searches and seizes and the tracing of suspects or proceeds. &quot; Special laws for drug trafficking and money laundering enforcement measures will also flow from this protocol,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will be hosting justice ministers of Commonwealth countries at a conference of money laundering in Cape Town in October, taking forward the process of establishing common money laundering laws in all the member states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Technology Foresight study, recently completed in Britain, attempts to urgently determine where and how the country can gain the competitive edge in the increasingly chaotic global market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This process is probably even more significant for South Africa, yet the word from the Departments of Post and Telecommunications, and Arts, Culture, Science and Technology is that our equivalent White Paper will take up to four years to produce. Developments on the ground point to an urgent need for a coherent policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Kahn, head of the Gauteng Information Technology Department, explains: &quot;It is a political question. We have a social commitment to development, and we need to become internationally competitive.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Society and Development (ISAD) conference of the G7 and developing states held in May, seemed to be heading towards a first phase of practicable measures to achieve this end. One of the lead projects for South Africa, taken up by the National Telecommunications Forum (NTF), is the development of infrastructure for multi-purpose community centres (MPCCs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Benjamin, who is co-ordinating the Community Access Task Team of the NTF, sees the centres as the logical extension of the information community, as opposed to the information superhighway and information society, highlighting the need to link information to community needs in developing states, rather than to the business needs of the technologically developed world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ideas informing the centres have evolved in a similar way. The ISAD was brimming with information idealists, who appeared to believe that access to the Internet would propel any disadvantaged community into the 21st-century overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics were quick to point out that a rural community in the Transkei would need access to cheap telephony and basic services like a fax, even before the more obvious literacy campaign that would enable them to surf the world wide web. Access to the technology will not necessarily ensure development; a carefully studied and negotiated process is much more critical to link technology to the real needs of a community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept is not new; in fact, practically each government line department has something equivalent on the go. The South African Police, for instance, have R200-million from the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) fund to invest in &quot;community safety centres&quot;; the Welfare Department has built six community centres linked to local RDP councils in the Western Cape; the Gauteng Public Works Department is building in Khutsong South, West Rand, for R2-million; Eskom has donated computers to an MPCC in Rabie Ridge, facilitated by the Community Development Forums in the North East Rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, a sum of R150 000 per MPCC has been promised by the United States for Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's Communications Task Team, with a proposal to build 10 pilot projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list certainly illustrates the government's and international donors' commitment to the need for information dissemination, but more critically it points to the lack of integrated planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Karaki, a veteran proponent of MPCCs in the country, is adamant: &quot; Lateral and vertical integration of planning is practically non-existent, this is massive wastage,&quot; owing to the way the budget is structured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each department and province has to submit their business plans by December 17, and spend the money by the end of September the following year. This leads to a panicked rush for projects that seem viable, but are neither consultative nor integrated, causing unnecessary duplication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem is that each department must be seen to deliver, therefore integrated projects may not have a high- enough profile, or enough quantifiable indicators for a specific department's needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have no time to consult each other, because of the time restraints.  Ideally, an autonomous co-ordinating body should be formed to integrate planning. This lack of integrated planning is one of the great successes of apartheid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A first initiative towards this end is being funded by the International Development Research Council of Canada. The project will audit and report on all organisations and projects that are related to the MPCC concept. Benjamin estimates that the network could number more than 2 000. More important, the country needs a policy framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kahn concludes that by identifying those areas in which South Africa is different and in fact ground-breaking could show the way forward. He cites an ironic by-product of the apartheid era: the development of military expertise at encryption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using this technological advantage, Eskom has created the prepaid electricity meter cards. Significantly, this led to Siemens becoming a strategic partner in the project. But it also raised the spectre of a targeted population still without electricity as they cannot afford to buy the cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the fundamental question: can we be both leaders and followers? In choosing where we head, we have to take into account who we are leading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kahn elaborates, &quot;If our primary concern is development, then technology is a tool we should be using. The point is to identify what elements we can develop that are ground-breaking and therefore offer potential economic leverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By providing computers and information centres to a largely illiterate population, we should be realising that we are in fact opening up a market in iconic programme development, and touch screen specialisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Rembrandt chairman Johann Rupert this week shrugged off the growing anti-tobacco lobby in the United States but warned the South African government against trying to milk more excise duty from the local industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked at the annual meeting in Stellenbosch what the recent court ruling against US company Brown and Williamson (B&amp;W) and President Bill Clinton's moves to clamp down on smoking would mean for the tobacco industry worldwide, Rupert said B&amp;W had appealed against the court ruling and was fairly confident it would win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was because although the US had more ex-smokers than smokers, the jury system was reluctant to find against the tobacco industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Originally, it was argued that there was a health risk that the smoker did not know about, but the juries ruled that there was a voluntary assumption of risk because it was assumed that everyone knows about the health risk,&quot; Rupert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then people tried to say that tobacco was addictive. The lawyers said that if it was addictive, why do you know more ex-smokers than smokers?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rupert, who insists on a liberal display of ashtrays at his annual meetings so that people can smoke, admitted that &quot;if a person has a sore throat, it is unpleasant for non-smokers to be in the same room. But claims that environmental tobacco smoke is a health risk are difficult to prove,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton has been pushing for tougher anti- smoking laws, especially in buildings, and higher excise duties on tobacco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rupert dismissed this as &quot;a very populist approach in an election year, especially given that Bob Dole has different views.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dole, who used to smoke heavily, has been reluctant to support the anti- smoking lobby, much to the dismay of conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What irritates me is that I know one of Clinton's best friends and he assures me that President Clinton enjoys his cigars ... and he DOES inhale,&quot; Rupert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of excise duties, Rupert said they were a double-edged sword.  It could be argued that they should be raised to discourage smoking and raise extra revenue for the fiscus, but this also encouraged the smuggling of imported tobacco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, he said, was a prime example of this. Excise duties had been raised so high that illegal tobacco imports were flourishing and could now be found in 80% of all urban retail outlets -- without the health warnings that local brands carried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said most of the illegal imports were Brazilian and American brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rupert blamed the illegal imports on the lack of trained manpower in customs and excise and doubted whether current efforts to jack up the department would yield results quickly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Eric Molobi, head of Kagiso Trust Investments, is not about to upset nine months of delicate negotiations with strong-arm tactics: &quot;We have no immediate plans to change the existing management at The Citizen,&quot; he assures me, &quot;or at Perksor for that matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot hold a gun to Perskor's heads and force them to transform overnight. By doing so we would just be shooting ourselves in the foot. I don't believe in turning everything upside-down for the sake of it. We have to tread carefully, but purposefully.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perskor and Kagiso may strike some as strange bedfellows, but to Molobi it made perfect sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The writing is on the wall,&quot; says Molobi. &quot;The government has made its position clear; no doubt there are many companies that turn away the opportunity of linking up with a black partnership, but that attitude is very short-sighted in this environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a time of transition, as South Africa is experiencing at present, one can either run away from the reality or engage it. We chose to do the latter.  We must work together to close the gap between the polarised elements of our society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rome -- and the new South Africa -- was not built in a day. The pace of change has been slow but not frustratingly so. &quot;Africans and Afrikaners are very similar -- much more than is generally believed. Take the extended family and our love of culture ... It's just that one was the underdog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the process of engagement is a slow one, but we will get there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, that approach has worked well at Kagiso's other investments.  Take the publishing group De Jager-HAUM. A very conservative instititution, the company changed, slowly, after Kagiso took over in 1994. Today, the managements work very well together, building on their respective strengths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Perskor's case, Kagiso will be represented by three members of a nine- person board, and its influence will be restricted to board level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not be involved in the day-to-day management,&quot; says Molobi. &quot;That is a recipe for chaos. We must leave the management to do what they do best.  We can't just tell them what to do; we must learn to understand the business, and from there develop a strategy for change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt in his mind that Perskor has to reposition itself and he has firm ideas on how to make it happen. &quot;We will set up management committees, overseeing human resources, for example, as we have done, very successfully, at our other partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you cannot change a newspaper overnight. Repositioning the Citizen will have to be done cautiously and thoughtfully. It still has the image of being a bastion of right-wing thinking, but if you change a brand too drastically, you could end up killing it. The paper has a strong black readership -- maybe not for the news content -- but we have to consider that when debating potential changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We will be canvassing other editors, marketing and advertising experts to come up with a feasible, workable solution -- and it will take time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editorial independence, however, is assured -- unless the editor is completely outrageous and &quot;writes a lot of nonsense&quot;, he jokes. But over the years Kagiso Trust has lent financial assistance to many a struggling newspaper, including this one, and never attempted to get involved. &quot;It is the best way,&quot; says Molobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since the tie-up was announced, speculation has been rife that the Citizen will soon get a black editor. Molobi is keen to quash such rumours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Affirmative action for the sake of it is not productive. When it first became fashionable, people were being poached all over the place, earning more and more but not staying in any one job for long. I would question whether anybody really benefited -- the individual didn't stick around long enough to learn loyalty, to the company or the position, and the economy lost out because training costs money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But by the same token, one cannot ignore the need for positive discrimination. Companies will have to take the lead to defuse the argument for government legislation. Already we are seeing a bit of a backlash, with old mind-sets taking hold again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Molobi reiterates the need for patience. &quot;Training is a long-term undertaking and we need to emphasise skills and competency before colour when making appointments. But at the same time there is no room for complacency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kagiso, for one, is not resting on its laurels. It is actively looking around for other synergistic investments, but Molobi will not be drawn on specifics. &quot;Shouting our plans from the roof-tops helps only to push up the price,&quot; he says. &quot;We prefer to go about our business quietly.&quot; And assuredly, he might have added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Dunlop offshoot sold: South African-based BTR Dunlop has sold its Dunlop Slazenger division (DSSA) to the British international sports equipment group, Dunlop Slazenger, for _3,3-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BTR Dunlop managing director Mike Smithyman said the sale was in line with the company's strategy to concentrate on its industrial and engineering businesses. The proceeds of about R23-million would be used to finance the future expansion of BTR Dunlop in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KWV in high spirits: Wine and spirits group, KWV Investments, lifted distributable income by 30,8% for the year to June 30. Distributable earnings rose to R35,45-million against R27,09-million in 1995. Earnings per share grew to 84,2 cents (64,3 cents) and a final dividend of 61 cents a share was declared, bringing the total to 84 cents (64,3 cents).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R50m investment: Liberty Life Association will invest R50-million in Kagiso Trust Investment Company, &quot;underscoring the group's commitment to responsible investment in companies and organisations that supported the development and reconstruction of the broader community interests&quot;. Liberty Life's managing director will join the board of KTI as a non-executive director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rand strengthens: The rand continued to strengthen on Thursday morning, trading at R4,5050 against the dollar and R7,01 against sterling. The rand's strength flushed out some speculators who had been long on dollars and short on rands, dealers said. The market had also heard rumours that trade figures would be better than expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuna buys into ICL: International Computers (ICL) of South Africa has agreed to sell 10% of its shares to Vuna Industrial Holdings, the industrial arm of Thebe Investment Corporation. Vuna has an option to lift its stake in ICL to 25%. Vuna will also acquire a sizeable part of CEPAD, an ICL subsidiary dedicated to training, capacity building and consultancy in the public sector. The deal is the result of the strategic linking of ICL's public administration divisions and Vuna subsidiary Bhekisizwe Computer systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last-minute wage offer: National Union of Mineworkers assistant general secretary Gwede Mantashe says the last-minute wage offer by De Beers Consolidated Mines closes the gap &quot;to an extent&quot; on the parties' difference in their deadlocked negotiations.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals's key annual address this week drew consensus among economists that South Africa's top banker is caught between a rock and a hard place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while there was agreement that the economy's vital statistics -- huge imports, a shaky balance of payments, and crippling debt levels -- were far from healthy, there was little unison on what Stals should do about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edey Rogers economic consultant Edward Osborn captured the essence of mainstream opinion, saying the speech was an elegant explanation of why Stals felt he could do nothing: he had to lift interest rates to attack the current account deficit on the balance of payments, but could not because real interest rates are so high and the economy is waning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Institute for Economic Policy, a left-wing economic think-tank, bucked the mainstream acceptance of Stals's inability to act, attacking him for abdicating from his responsibility by blaming everything on the business cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior economist Asghar Adelzadeh said that with the economy cooling down, Stals had to cut interest rates immediately to help stimulate growth. He agreed with Stals that the crucial problem in the economy was the current account deficit, but felt the governor should use monetary policy to beef up industry so as to dampen import demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had similar criticisms of government's economic policy -- its macro- economic strategy was aimless, and contained no clear targets or strategies to create employment. In particular, he lashed out at the approach of cutting import duties more rapidly than the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adelzadeh suggested the government isolate those imports that should be discouraged -- especially ones, such as luxury cars, that did not help create jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Old Mutual chief economist Dave Mohr said the most striking feature of Stals's address to the bank's annual general meeting was that he signalled inflation was no longer his chief enemy. Instead, Stals now had the current account deficit in his sights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mohr was not convinced the economy had slowed sufficiently in the first half of the year to lead to the slowdown in imports Stals desperately needed to see an improvement in the balance of payments. He estimated gross domestic expenditure in the second quarter had risen a seasonally adjusted quarter on quarter and annualised 8%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rand Merchant Bank chief economist Rudolph Gouws said the fall in inflation in April to a 24-year low of 5,5% was &quot;not a flash in the pan, but part of a fundamental downtrend that started in the late 1980s&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent attempt to terminate sporadic speculation of his imminent resignation, Stals ended his speech by saying he looked forward to welcoming back the bank's shareholders at next year's AGM.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - One sometimes wonders what leading South African soccer officials read during their leisure hours. Tales of Central African dictators from days gone by, perhaps?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There certainly seems to be a longing for unnecessary control among some gentlemen who reside at National Soccer League (NSL) headquarters in Soccer City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can imagine them reading this and muttering that those awful people from the media are at it again. Always looking at the negative side of affairs.  Sensationalists who belong among the English &quot;gutter&quot; press. But the facts of the matter are that while South African political rulers preach transparency, the NSL often prefers to operate in such secrecy that one would think state security was at risk. Take, for example, the draw for the first-round proper of the Bob Save Super Bowl knockout competition, the South African equivalent of the FA Cup in England.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can you imagine the FA Cup draw being conducted in a television studio with a couple of representatives from the sponsors, a few football officials and a few members of the media present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer, in case you did not guess, is no! Well, that is what happened last Thursday at Auckland Park and the rest of the South African soccer community only became aware of who had drawn whom two days later when the event was televised. One newspaper, whose intrepid reporter sneaked into the draw much to the annoyance of the &quot;soccer secret police&quot;, was inundated with calls from clubs wanting to know who their opponents were. The timing of the draw on television was also bizarre, to put it mildly. It was broadcast during the interval of a Coca- Cola Cup quarter-final between Supersport United and Kaizer Chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Coca-Cola and First National Bank may not be direct competitors, the makers of the &quot;real thing&quot; were surely entitled to have the centre stage to themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One would also have thought that the chairmen of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) were entitled to attend the Super Bowl draw. Unfortunately, they were holding a meeting at a downtown Johannesburg hotel while the draw was being made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much for the secrecy, now to the desire to control, which is clearly illustrated by the fact that the NSL has once again returned to its bad old habits of ignoring established international norms. In just about every other country, the first team out of the hat (or glass bowl to be precise) has the option of playing at home. Here, big brother must scrutinise the pairings first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember the bad old days when certain clubs (no names, no scandal) always seemed to have home advantage, especially if they had difficult opponents to contend with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, after relentless media pressure over several years, the international practice of giving home advantage to the first team out was reluctantly accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But old habits die hard. The dictators were losing control of the situation.  Who were those nasty media men to tell them what to do. It was time to return to the dark ages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most glaring example of interference was the decision to take the Coca- Cola Cup quarter-final between Bush Bucks and Orlando Pirates to Boet Erasmus, the Port Elizabeth home of Eastern Cape rugby. Big brother decided that Independence Stadium in Umtata, the natural home of Bucks, was not big enough to host the expected large crowd so it was switched to a stadium 500km away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bucks protested in vain and the fact that they won 4-1 on penalties obviously softened the anger considerably. The fact is Bucks were right to be angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line is that the clubs must be allowed to make the decisions. If Bucks want to play Pirates on Mars, and can arrange appropriate transport, so be it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to what some NSL officials believe, club officials are capable of making decisions in the best interests of the team, its players, and its supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If, for example, an amateur club like Boksburg are drawn at home to Kaizer Chiefs, they will quickly realise that their ground is too small to accommodate the likely crowd, and make alternate arrangements. So, NSL officials, let the clubs dictate their affairs. After all, if they choose the wrong venue, they lose out. Then the NSL can attend to more pressing matters, like answering telephones that ring endlessly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the subject of media criticism, it would appear the Premier Soccer League (PSL) took a few unfair cracks of the whip for changing the time and venue of the midweek clash of Orlando Pirates and Sundowns. When the fixture list was drawn up several weeks ago, the authorities could not have known that the Rand Stadium would be closed indefinitely while new seating was installed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original kickoff time of 3pm was obvious madness and it made more sense to turn the attractive pairing into a floodlit fixture, although the late notice given to the clubs was unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can but hope that as time passes, the professionalism imported from England in the form of Trevor Phillips will rub off on those around him and criticism of secrecy and bungling will become obsolete. Contrary to popular belief among ultra- sensitive football officials, the media do have better things to do than criticise, but they dare not ignore issues which clog the telephone lines on radio talk shows. In the dream world of the would-be dictators, all their critics will be sent on all-expenses-paid holidays to some Indian Ocean island, where they will remain forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials will then create their news bulletin, full of prose extolling the virtues of these hard-working officials. And what will they call it? The Daily Deceiver, of course.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The opening ceremonies of both the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games used Martin Luther King's &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech to portray the lofty ideals to which they aspire. But it is the Paralympics and their constant struggle against the stereotyping of disabled people with which King would probably have identified most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King's life was dedicated to eradicating all forms of prejudice and discrimination, and whether it was through indifference of the media and hence the general public, or the lack of support from big business and the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (Acog), the Paralympics faced a continual uphill battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end though the trials and tribulations of the Paralympics carried the day and left many people feeling that it was these Games rather than the Olympics which most closely resembled the original concept of Baron Pierre de Coubertin who brought the modern Olympic Games into being a hundred years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From the very moment that paraplegic mountaineer Mark Wellmann, using only a rope and his incredible arm power, scaled the tower to light the Paralympic flame, it was evident that these Games would indeed live up to their theme: the Triumph of the Human Spirit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Run on a shoestring budget of little more than the $60-million it cost to put on the opening and closing ceremonies for the Olympics, the Paralympics not surprisingly had their fair share of organisational problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those who witnessed the competition at these Games were genuinely inspired by what they saw. &quot;Many people have asked me what is the difference between the Olympics and the Paralympics,&quot; said one volunteer who had worked on both Games. &quot;I told them it was like the difference between staying at the Ritz and living in a teepee. One is beautiful to look at but the other is real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if at first it was possible to feel sorry for some of the participants and then later to start regarding them as superheroes, at the end it was easy to look upon them all just as great sportsmen and women, which is exactly how they would like it to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's 41-strong team to the Games contained many great athletes and they proved that by winning an amazing total of 28 medals, including 10 golds. And make no mistake, their successes were every bit as hard earned as those of their able-bodied counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paralympic champions like Jean-Jacques Terblanche, Ebert Kleynhans and Fanie Lombaard all train at least four hours a day. Many of the team were expected to do well, with the team's chef de mission Andy Scott predicting between 12 and 20 medals before the Games. The fact that they did much better than expected is because several of the younger athletes really rose to the occasion and surpassed themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the biggest find of the Games for South Africa was Malcolm Pringle who won two silvers and a gold in the men's T 37 cerebral palsy class.  Originally only entered in his speciality event over 800m it was decided to enter him in the 400m and 1 500m as well -- and what a sensation he turned out to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He started with the the 400m, which he had never run seriously before, and came second behind Britain's Stephen Payton who set a new world record of 54.  23. Pringle beat his personal best by more than three seconds with a time of 55.34 and was so delighted with his performance that he leapt across the finish line like someone who had just won the lottery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought I was going to come last,&quot; he said afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1 500m the 18-year-old Standard Eight pupil from Cape Town got so involved in his own race plan that he forgot to check on the other runners and when he reached the bell he was more than 60m behind. He finally woke up with 300m to go when he was trailing in seventh place. but Pringle's kick is phenomenal and by the time he entered the home straight he was fourth and only 20m behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just like Hezekial Sepeng a few weeks earlier, had the race been 10m longer he would have won, but he had to settle for silver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday he was leaving nothing to chance in his favourite event and led from the gun to the tape in a new world record of 2:06.78. His victory lap was something to behold as he first went up to the television camera and blew a kiss and then toured the stadium bowing to the crowd. &quot;I expected to win the 800m because I broke the world record in training a few weeks before I came to Atlanta, but my medal in the 400m was a complete surprise,&quot; said Pringle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is just one of the many stars in the South African Paralympic team who should now start getting the kind of recognition and support from the public that they deserve.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Portraits of Power: Profiles in a Changing South Africa by Mark Gevisser (David Philip, R59,99)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Readers of the Mail &amp; Guardian will need no introduction to Mark Gevisser's profiles of South Africa's powerful, famous and infamous. Regular readers of his column may, in fact, wonder whether they deserve a re-reading . The short answer is: they do.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is all too easy to reduce history to a Great Man narrative (or indeed, in our case, a Madiba narrative), but Gevisser manages to avoid such temptation admirably. One manages to see each subject within his or her contexts (political, cultural, religious or even military), interacting with other persons, products of their circumstances yet also actors within them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gevisser's approach combines the empathy of a psychoanalyst with the critical eye of an investigative journalist. He usually gives each subject the benefit of the doubt, lets them defend themselves if necessary, but does not hesitate to press them to answer difficult questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An added bonus is Gevisser's command of language and understanding of his subject's backgrounds. Add to this a sense of the ironic or humorous and what we have in Portraits of Power is a book that is not only highly informative but also well-written and very enjoyable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people interviewed include government ministers and deputy-ministers (Gill Marcus, Bantu Holomisa, Zola Skweyiya, Brigitte Mabandla, Trevor Manuel, among others), regional premiers (such as Raymond Mhlaba, Mathews Phosa, and Tokyo Sexwale), academic and cultural figures (Hugh Masekela, Anant Singh, Mbongeni Ngema, Malegapuru Makgoba, Charles van Onselen), religious,political and trade union leaders (Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Chief Rabbi Cyril Harris, Sam Shilowa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are all revealing portraits of the shifting social realignments of the new South Africa. Ironically, since publication some of the subjects interviewed here have shifted quite dramatically. Gevisser's book has become part of the record of such &quot;seismic&quot; activity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - She was chosen above Madonna to launch Pepsi in Nigeria.  Flowers were strewn on the road from Entebbe Airport to Kampala in Uganda for her visit there and she has just been to Zaire to collect an Ngwomo Award -- the grand prix Africain de la chanson. Yvonne Chaka Chaka, the Princess of Africa, has come a long way from the little schoolgirl who often didn't have enough lunch money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The front door of her Bryanston home is one huge rhino carving; a stuffed lynx and what we think is a serval cat lie in her entrance hall. Pictures of her family with President Mandela -- in her home -- are on the walls. Outside are luxury minibuses and a limousine -- her new car-hire business. She also used to have two Vonny's Hair Salons, but she closed them down because they demanded too much time, she says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She gives me happy snaps of herself, her husband and Michael Jackson at a Lost City dinner recently. &quot;Ooooh, he's so nice. So shy. He looks down when you speak to him. He's so kind too, he just signed things for everybody and he stayed at the dinner a full two hours. We expected him to just be there for 10 minutes.&quot; She swears there were no strange lines or wrinkles on his face, as British gutter press reports would have us believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's light years from the matchbox house in Dobsonville where little Yvonne Ntombizodwa Machaka was brought up. And although the family was poor, there was clearly lots of love. Her father, Rex, a driver, died when she was a child and she still adores him. Her mother, Sophie, worked as a domestic to bring up her three daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Yvonne, who sang in church choirs as a child, became one of South Africa's top-selling pop artists with such songs such as I'm In Love With the DJ; I'm Burning Up; I Cry for Freedom; Stimela, and probably her most popular song of all, Umqombothi. Musically, it's her most &quot;African&quot; song; it's all about traditional beer, but the rest of Africa has completely appropriated it and changed its meaning. In Uganda the word approximated one for &quot;freedom fighter&quot; and in Tanzania it sounded like the word for one who believes in God.  She is indeed the Princess of Africa and for that reason is considering reissuing some of her older songs in Lingala (a Zairean language), French and Swahili.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her fame at home these days lags somewhat behind that on the rest of the continent. &quot;I'm bigger in Africa than in South Africa now. People are used to me here and I've performed a lot here. I'm just pleased I managed to break into Africa, I'm going for Europe next. In Zaire just now (where Miriam Makeba also won an award) so many promoters wanted me to go over on my own and I'd love to do it.&quot; She has performed in Paris and London before, but in mixed concerts, not solo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now, she's supposed to be in the studio starting her next album. Last year's Power of Africa represented a big break, in that she produced and financed it herself. &quot;It was wonderful. It was one of my best LPs and the media response was good, but it didn't sell well ... I guess I'm going to be working with Teal (her old label) again on the next album.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What music will she be doing? &quot;I just love music that's good for everybody.  People sometimes say this is too black or this is too white. That makes me sick. I hate it. Music is just music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her attention is diverted by three-year-old Mandla, sitting on the piano stool in his dressing gown and very seriously watching proceedings. &quot;Go and wash, Mandla.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Noooo,&quot; he whines. But he does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yvonne is mother to four boys, ranging from three to 15, a somewhat ironic position for someone called Ntombizodwa (&quot;girls only&quot;) because her mother had three daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She nearly lost one of her sons though, when she went to Zaire in 1989. Six months pregnant, her water broke before she left. &quot;Because of the contract, I had to go, the doctor wanted me to stay at home for two months.&quot; Her husband, a GP, flew up to be with her and enforced three days' rest. But the shows, all eight of them, went on. &quot;They were packed, packed. But at one stage I just wanted to kill myself, I felt so bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, she loves performing in Africa. &quot;It's amazing, I love it, knowing that 60 000 to 70 000 people have come to see you alone. In Lubumbashi once it was 150 000.&quot; It was figures like these that persuaded Pepsi to use Yvonne rather than Madonna to launch their drink in Nigeria. Perhaps local business should take note of local star power and dump the bland models they often settle for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, she's not the only queen on the scene. Yvonne has always been an admirer of pop star Brenda Fassie, from the time she was at school, so she's a little impatient with the idea that they're enemies. &quot;She's never been my rival. It's the press and other people who say that. We're different.  Whenever we meet, she says she didn't say what was reported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Fassie in 1992 told Mail &amp; Guardian arts editor Charl Blignaut, then working for Vrye Weekblad, that Yvonne &quot;thinks she's white. She says: 'I stay next door to the Oppenheimers.' Who the fuck wants to know that. I'm married to a doctor. Who wants to know that? Call Brenda Fassie, I'll tell you who I fucked last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Yvonne will say though, is that she can't comment, that she hasn't got the time or the energy to waste on this kind of thing. Right now, the limo business is working very well, so well that they're considering opening a branch in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a new record in the pipeline, the concerts are still thriving and she's taking French lessons, the better to communicate with Francophone Africa. Yvonne's always been a believer in self-improvement -- when she found herself with a hit record, she went for singing and drama lessons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a long way from her original dream of being a lawyer (she applied for 15 bursaries to go to university back in the 1980s and didn't get one), but hey, now she employs them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - From arts and culture to agriculture. That's where the outgoing Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, Professor Ben Ngubane, is heading when he assumes his new post as minister of finance and agriculture in the Inkatha Freedom Party's (IFP) government. And, with his newly acquired green thumb, he's giving the thumbs-up to incumbent, Lionel Mtshali. Minister of education in the KwaZulu government and MP in the KwaZulu National Assembly since 1994, Mtshali might have succeeded in his efforts to upgrade schools, teaching skills and literacy in the rural areas, but he's going to need a lot more than a master's degree in education to cope with the cultural lesson he is about to receive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both ministers have a tentative spring in their respective strides.  Ngubane will embark on a crash course in farming and rural development, shifting from the the drafting of White Papers to the rustling of green.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mtshali, for his part, seems more than willing to fill the gentlemanly shoes of his predecessor, set the wheels of the White Paper on Arts and Culture in motion and focus on the development of previously neglected cultural areas. That's the good news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bad news is that no one really knows the fate of the arts in this country. Rumours are rife in cultural circles that the ministry might soon be disbanded and absorbed into the Ministry of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also fears that culture will never be upgraded from step-child status; that it is low on the government's list of financial priorities; and that its principal purpose is to perform the role of the sacrificial lamb to the gods of political expediency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet both ministers deny the end is imminent. &quot;We've fought too long and too hard to secure a distinctive, separate and well-deserved place for arts and culture in South Africa&quot;, says Ngubane. &quot;I would be extremely surprised if it were to go to education, because that would amount to a total regression.&quot; Mtshali is equally optimistic about the future for arts and culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to be sworn in on Monday, he admits to &quot;great surprise&quot; at being appointed to the position. But he is &quot;excited by the challenge of implementing all the good work my predecessor has started. In all fairness to the good of this country, I feel obliged to follow in the footsteps of Dr Ngubane by looking to the White Paper as the guiding principle for the future of arts and culture.&quot; Sounds fair enough. On paper that is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in 1935 in Kingsley, KwaZulu-Natal, Mtshali's credentials would make him a viable candidate for a job in the education ministry -- not commander in chief on the cultural battle-front. But, for what is broadly acknowledged as a political appointment -- the government chose the incumbent arts minister from a list of candidates submitted by the IFP -- he is a safe bet.  A staunch IFP member since his student years during the 1970s at Fort Hare, he is less adept at Sturm und Drang politics than playing follow-my-leader.  In other words he prefers sailing in the boat to rocking it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also believes it is &quot;crucial to have a co-operative relationship with key people&quot; such as the director general of the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, Roger Jardine, and other administrative heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he disputes its relevance to his portfolio, he is of conservative disposition and deeply religious. But he doesn't seem to hold strong views on issues such as censorship and freedom of expression. In fact he doesn't seem to hold strong views on anything to do with culture. Except the inheritance bequeathed him by his predecessor, namely, the White Paper. Oh, and his cultural passions include reading and listening to choral music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while it's unlikely that his appointment will prove earth-shatteringly revolutionary (or, for that matter, reactionary), it should be remembered that his predecessor, Ngubane, wasn't to the ministry born either. The ex- KwaZulu minister of health with the diplomatic demeanour epitomised the unthreatening outsider -- an IFP moderate who favoured participation in the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes called &quot;the bear who really cares&quot;, he was also called the &quot;great straddler&quot; and accused of being too conciliatory. But Ngubane came up with some surprises. He took on Winnie -- and won. Among numerous unenviable tasks, he launched the long-overdue White Paper amid shrieks of &quot;white elephant&quot;.  He emerged with his dignity and faculties intact. And many believe he has been unflinchingly committed to the cause of culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been a tough task, transforming the performing arts councils, attempting to address cultural grievances and redressing past imbalances,&quot; he recalls, &quot;and it is a pity to be leaving so soon when there is still much to be done. But it has been a time of great stimulus, encouragement and challenge&quot;. He adds: &quot;We must have faith and work together to ensure the birth of a new cultural spirit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever the faithful shoe-filler, Mtshali echoes his sentiments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A searing critique of the government's macro-economic framework has come from the national political education secretariat of the South African Communist Party (SACP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Published this month in the debut edition of the new left-wing journal Debate, the critique, by Langa Zita, Dale McKinley and Vishwas Satgar, amounts to a fundamental rejection of the strategy -- and represents one of the first salvos in the internal debate racking the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say the strategy is not a framework within which the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) can be delivered and that it represents a shift to the right by the African National Congress-led government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel's pronouncement that the framework is &quot;non-negotiable&quot;, they say this &quot;contradicts the basis of the alliance itself&quot; and say it is imperative the SACP engage the ANC and its other alliance partner, labour federation Cosatu, on the future of the strategy. Consultation on the framework, they say, &quot;was merely driven by the intention of dampening any misgivings of the alliance partners&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also critical of government's use of the technical skills of &quot; mainly old order economists and the World Bank, while progressive economists in NGOs and the broader alliance were not part of the process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, they say, it was not surprising: that the framework relies on a monetarist &quot;trickle-down approach with growth first and redistribution subject to the cake increasing in size&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By accepting the logic of deficit reduction and existing constraints, such a fiscal policy &quot;serves middle and upper- income earners who benefit from tax reductions, while the working class have to accept wage restraint&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arguing that South Africa's debt is low in comparison with most advanced capitalist economies and that the framework exaggerates the threat of a debt trap, they warn that the strategy's reliance on projections of relatively strong, sustained growth and foreign investment to fund social spending and increased state investment in infrastructure means it is already in trouble: &quot; In short the broad- based growth expected by the strategy has already faltered, and therefore in order for the government to achieve the deficit reduction targets, health and education spending will have to be restrained, mainly impacting on the poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy's plans for monetary and foreign exchange policy also come under fire. Zita, McKinley and Satgar say interest-rate policy (excessively high by international standards) effects inflation only by causing economic contraction. Instead of providing for growth, it acts as a constraint on domestic investment in housing, and on small-to-medium enterprises which can't afford loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while exchange-control liberalisation is meant to create private sector investment, they say it would encourage short-term foreign investors keen only to get their money out. &quot;Instead government policy should be directed at releasing the substantial domestic resources existing in the economy,&quot; they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zita, McKinley and Satgar argue that the absence of legislated central bargaining in most sectors will lead to increased exploitation of workers, and lower wages. The proposed social accord, hinged on wage restraint for workers while middle and upper-income salaries rise, contradicts RDP goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An export-led growth strategy, spurred by accelerated tariff reductions, would only bring jobs in capital-intensive, high- skill sectors and see retrenchments in labour-intensive sectors. Incentives for foreign capital would undercut local industries and reduce state tax revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Written as an internal discussion paper soon after the macro-economic strategy was announced, the article represents one strand of the debate raging within the SACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are different perspectives within the party,&quot; said SACP deputy secretary general Jeremy Cronin. &quot;By and large there is a critical feeling in the party towards the macro-economic strategy, while among the grassroots there is a sense of frustration and anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The official position of the party has not yet been elaborated. We want to keep the debate open, rather than shut it down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This week saw the publication of You Have Been Warned, a book on the first 10 years of the Mail &amp; Guardian. At the launch, Judge Ismail Mahomed spoke of the paper's past and its future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You Have Been Warned is not just the story of Irwin Manoim (who edited the book) or even of just Anton Harber, and Clive Cope, of Stephen Goldblatt and David Dison, of Joel Joffe, and Shaun Johnson, of David Beresford and Marilyn Kirkwood -- or indeed of the scores and scores of gutsy, committed, but quite crazy and irrational men and women of different backgrounds and temperaments who defied the most elementary principles of accounting and newspaper wisdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only did they tilt gloriously at forbidding windmills of awesomely entrenched and intimidating power, but survived long enough to recount their tales with a mixture of lacerating agony and a warm and healing romance -- and a sweet vindication, consistently interrupted by that state of restless integrity and passionate scepticism so central to the ethos which has sustained them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You Have Been Warned is the exciting story of such men and women certainly, but it is much, much more. It is the story of a resurrected nation over a momentous decade, first recapturing its moral legitimacy from its historical desecration through the pain and the shame of racism, then celebrating that great triumph with the unalloyed adulation of the whole civilised world -- and now seeking to consolidate and to defend its achievements, under the conflicting pressures of the often intimidating, despairing and massive legacy of its brutal past, the agonies and the manifest limitations of its present and the high, but legitimate, expectations and impatience for a better future for yesterday's victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is the story of a nation confronting these deep conflicts -- sometimes brilliantly, sometimes disappointingly, very often traumatically, but always with that faith and legitimacy, which is crucial and in which we must all share. It is our country and we alone can, and will, overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been, for very many, a decade of untold suffering and sadness in this nation. But it has also been a decade of fulfilment and joy of a significance unmatched by any other in its massive consequences for the lives of those who have survived and those yet to be born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Weekly Mail, now the Mail &amp; Guardian, has recorded this great decade for us with vigour and courage. But it has been more than just a faithful recorder of this history. It has influenced its course and direction, often by challenging the orthodox, by articulating the heretical, by confronting the smug, by defying the mighty, by inspiring the despairing, by outwitting the tyrannical, by dignifying the brutalised, by tempering the angry, by universalising the parochial, by exposing the untruthful, by mocking the pompous and by taunting the hypocritical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has gladdened many grieving and despairing hearts by kicking racial and gender bigotry publicly in the guts. But it has occasionally also disappointed by sometimes appearing to join in the apparent tiredness and emptiness of the hangover which has intermittently followed the celebrations, and even by growling ineffectively in that condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has gladdened by its management of the tension between the state of intellectual scepticism fundamental to its own unarticulated ethos and the passion which compels it gloriously to engage in its moral crusades. It has disappointed occasionally by its response to the tension between the drive to uncover dramatic scoops when none might in truth exist and the deeper and more mature commitment to inform, to educate and to restructure the moral and ethical premises of our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both its formidable triumphs and its occasional disappointments are bonded by an integrity which is fierce and unfailing, and a compassion which is deep and consistent. Both must drive it to witness and to influence the next decade, as our nation begins to confront the awesome challenges of the next epoch -- the obscene disparities in living standards between black and white in South Africa, the deeply disempowering legacy of apartheid, the pervading poverty, the cruel levels of malnutrition, the despairing homelessness and the debilitating joblessness. Political rights alone cannot meaningfully reverse any of these problems, however eloquent their constitutional articulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps, above all, there is the need to confront the demeaning corrosion of our moral and spiritual fibre, initially penetrated by the crassness and the lovelessness of apartheid but now sustained through its consequences, by levels of brutality, of murder, of rape, and of deceit which diminish us all in our humanity and bring shame to our species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever be the state of our material riches, we shall truly not be free until that moral and spiritual fibre is restored and renewed, and sustains the sinews of our resurrected nation as it prepares for a millennium in which genetic engineering on our own planet and technological forays and new insights into the infinity of the cosmos will compel a re-examination of the most deeply entrenched truths which have so axiomatically dominated our life and our living for so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May the Mail &amp; Guardian continue for the next decade its formidable historical role, with the vigour and the integrity which has impressed so many for so long, augmented as it now is by an experience of rare intensity and pain and glory in the life of a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I may not be around to celebrate the book of the second decade of the Mail &amp; Guardian, but this does not disqualify me from praying for the next decade what Rabridinath Tagore prayed for his country many, many decades ago:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where the world has not been broken up Into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by thee Into everwidening thought and action- Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - &quot;However far apart our bodies may be / Our souls are locked together in perpetual embrace.&quot; So concludes a poem by Ben J Langa, written to his younger brothers Mandla and Bheki after they went into exile, and published in Staffrider. As the invocation of a shared childhood, the poem is moving for its absolute lack of political dogma, as if describing the effect of exile on a family is politics enough. It is a simple, but great poem; its inclusion well-warranted in an anthology entitled A Land Apart, edited by Andre Brink and JM Coetzee in the late Eighties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mandla Langa is back in South Africa now, he remains as far apart from his brother's body as he has ever been. For Ben Langa, a prominent Natal activist, was murdered in 1984 in Pietermaritzburg by Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) operatives who accused him of being an informer. As he predicted, though, his soul does remain in perpetual embrace with that of his brother: his spirit is to be found all over The Naked Song, Mandla Langa's recently released collection of short stories.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandla Langa was in exile when his brother was killed. The morning after the murder, he went into work as usual and was told about it, casually, by one of his colleagues at the Department of Information and Publicity in Lusaka. He had, in fact, trained one of his brother's murderers in Angola.  Another, meeting him in Lusaka, almost cruelly told him how much he resembled his brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in South Africa, two of the perpetrators were caught and sentenced to death. The oldest Langa brother, Pius -- then an activist attorney -- stood up at rallies, stated his objections to the death penalty, and called for his brother's murderers' sentences to be commuted. What an extraordinary family!  The men were hanged. In exile, Mandla Langa broke down: &quot;My brother dies through an agency I'm familiar with -- our own -- because he's suspected of being an informer. My mind jumps ... Is it true that this is what he was? And if it's not true, what are we?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first question has been answered: in its submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week, the African National Congress admitted to having been &quot;disinformed&quot; into murdering Ben Langa by a double-agent named &quot;Fear&quot;. But the second question remains -- &quot;what are we?&quot; -- and forms the basis for his critical, searing narratives; stories that break new ground in South African literature, not only because of the way they represent street suss with sophisticated fluency, but because of their introspection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandla Langa is the first South African writer to give literary voice to the trauma accompanying the return from exile, and the transition from &quot; struggle&quot; consciousness into that void where your own beliefs and desires, rather than those of the movement, define you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He uses the word &quot;naked&quot; to describe why he does not want to take the story of his brother to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission: &quot;From the images I've seen on the box, I'm terrified of the commission. To sit in front of that crowd of strangers and unburden yourself, to be naked in public, it's a terrifying prospect. And I'm not sure I'm in touch enough with my emotions to go through with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His title story, The Naked Song, has as its protagonist a psychologist, Leonard Gama, who is confronted with a patient rendered mute by his return to South Africa. It turns out that the trauma that robbed him of speech on his return to South Africa is the revelation that his missing girlfriend -- an MK cadre -- was killed because she was suspected of being an informer. Gama experiences an explicit identification with his patient; they are clearly the two sides of Mandla Langa, both in need of healing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langa is gentle and sensual, sloe-eyed and languid. His brother's death, he tells me, &quot;remains unresolved; something for me to deal with through other forms of creativity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He returned to South Africa late, only in 1994, as he had been the ANC's deputy chief representative in London, and -- like his character Blade Zungu in the story Proud Flesh -- collapsed into alcoholism. &quot;When I came home after all those years, I was aware of my own sense of vulnerability, my inability to come to terms with the new country even though I'd been part of the process to dismantle the old one. But coming back and dealing with the greed, with the palpable poverty, brought about a doom that I thought was going to be my undoing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pulled himself out by writing, by finding &quot;interlocutors&quot; who could express what he was feeling. And so we have Leonard Gama and Blade Zungu. So too do we have Caleb Zungu, an insurance salesman who tries to kill himself because he is going bald; and Jomo Khumalo, a failed artist whose destiny becomes entwined with a Sekoto-like figure from exile, and who finds salvation by following his father's example by taking the cloth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike his own father -- a charismatic minister whose mission took him and his poverty-stricken family all over South Africa -- salvation comes, for Langa, not from the Christian paradigm of absolution or redemption. It can also no longer come from the struggle paradigm of revolution and political liberation. It comes, rather, from self-knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langa's characters, more often than not, are artists -- painters, musicians, journalists -- whose craft is unable to save them from their anguish. He says that what saved him was the process of inventing his stories: &quot;To be able to look at other people, their humour, their trickery, and bounce that off my own life.&quot; He doesn't say it explicitly, but he knows, I am sure, that this is just the first step. If anything will save him, it is the nakedness of his own song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has published two novels previously, both before the backdrop of the struggle. Both have had limited circulation and have received scant attention.  The Naked Song is in a different league, and Langa now carries with him all the insecurity of a creator awaiting the reception of his new work. He often pauses in his storytelling as we sit on his Jo'burg stoep, to ask, &quot;how do you say it?&quot;, before embarking upon the word he thinks he wants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His home is a rambling old highveld affair. His wife Ilva is a new bureaucrat: she runs Tokyo Sexwale's office. And yet their home has the unironed feel of the marginal artist: it has not been smoothed into soullessness by the hot press of power. Langa has chosen to make the writer rather the politician his primary identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet he is very much a public figure, in what has become one of the most illustrious, if diffident, families of the new dispensation. Pius Langa is on the constitutional court; Bheki Langa is chief director of Jacob Zuma's Economic Affairs Department in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mandla Langa is president of the Congress of South African Writers and chair of Thabo Mbeki's Task Group into Government Communications (Comtask), set up to determine how government communication is to be restructured and what should be done about the ownership and control of South African media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langa readily admits to some &quot;schizophrenia&quot;; the cleavage of his life into an individual writerly self and a collectively identified public self. He'll do the praise-songs if he has to: &quot;But even though, when I do, people tell me, 'that's brilliant', I know it's not me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which probably renders him eminently qualified for the chairship of the task group: what better person to assess the government's propaganda apparatus than one who has set as his literary project the need to find an individual destiny within the collectivity of struggle and transformation? He has steered Comtask -- its Stalinist nomenclature notwithstanding -- away from precisely the kind of interventionist agenda many believe the state wants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, which met with parliament this week, plans to release its recommendations in October. Langa says the South African Communications Services (Sacs) &quot;must not have the monolithic structure of a ministry of information&quot;; although he won't say it, he is clearly appalled by a suggestion that Sacs should transform into a government news agency. He believes that diversity within the media is the best way to ensure the government's side is heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while he understands the government's prickliness about criticism in the media, he thinks this criticism is unmotivated, rather than undue. &quot;Take the Aids debacle,&quot; he says. &quot;If it had broken out in England, (Nkosazana) Zuma would have had to resign. But here, the media just bays for blood rather than putting the facts as strongly as possible, rather than constructing arguments that are irrefutable. And they bay for blood in a way that makes other people move into a laager rather than take them seriously. So yes, I think the media in South Africa can actually be quite tame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langa, after his homecoming-funk, has bustled into activity. He is writing an opera with Hugh Masekela; he has set up a production company that has adapted South Africa's best short stories into a series he is hoping to sell to the South African Broadcasting Corporation; and he has been writing a television column for the New Nation. There's a sharp, canny energy to his prose; a wonderfully wry humour and an obsession with post-apartheid Johannesburg or the KwaMashu of his childhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the heart of his work comes from a darker, more troubled place: &quot;(N)ow we all smile, baring the teeth of ceremony&quot;. Blade Zungu reflects on the new South Africa in Proud Flesh. &quot;The exiles move from lands that become forgotten as time passes ... The men jump into the nearest beerhall and drink and drown and rise no more. The young ones watch. They see their friends growing up in despair; the young woman with eyes as ageless as the sun knows her body is being watched by wolves. The wolves laugh and slink into corners and blow another blast of Durban Poison and a desperate drunk sings 'Swing low, sweet chariot', wishing for caring human hands to hold him and carry him home. But where is home? Tears sprang into his eyes again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Langa and I sat on his stoep, he tried to suppress his own tears while talking about the death of his brother. What upsets him is not so much the tragic error of Ben Langa's murder, as the memory of how callously the information was imparted to him; as if the movement had failed in its paternal duties. &quot;Where is home?&quot; asks Blade Zungu in Proud Flesh. His distress -- and perhaps Mandla Langa's too -- arises, at least in part, from the realisation that the ANC does not and cannot provide the home it promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therein lies Langa's critical consciousness: it might not assure him longevity in the political elite, but it may well render him one of South Africa's great post-struggle writers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - A showdown is looming for President Robert Mugabe's government as 60 000 civil servants continue to strike for pay rises of more than 20%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With hospitals overstretched, mortuaries overflowing and airports in chaos, the strike, now in its second week, is the biggest and most disruptive since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 7 000 strikers gathered in a Harare park this week to hear their angry union leaders imploring Mugabe &quot;to be man enough&quot; to address their demands for substantial increases.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Intimidation is not the right approach. The manly thing to do is to face the problem right in the face, acknowledge our stance that we are not going to accept insults, and pay us,&quot; Givemore Masongorera, the president of the Public Service Association union, said to wild cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police armed with pistols, semi-automatic rifles and teargas canisters kept a wary eye on the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the strikers -- including doctors, nurses, accountants and engineers -- were sacked last week by Labour minister Florence Chitauro. &quot;All the civil servants who did not return to work are fired and they will not be permitted to return to work,&quot; she reiterated on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strikers scoff at Chitauro's ultimatum. &quot;We were not hired on television so we cannot be fired on television,&quot; Masongorera said. &quot;There are procedures for dismissing workers and the government must follow them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strikers want substantially more than the 6% to 9% rises included in their latest salary cheques. They say the increases should at least match Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate of more than 26%. They cite a government survey which shows that workers in the private sector are paid 175% more than equivalent civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Civil servants in this country are grossly underpaid,&quot; the Unified Civil Servants' Committee said this week. &quot;The government is behaving irresponsibly by failing to address our grievances in a modern and balanced fashion and instead is using high-handed tactics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far the strike has been peaceful. Three strike organisers were arrested last week and released on condition they did not incite strikers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's hospitals are running an emergency service with the help of the army medical corps and Red Cross volunteers. At overcrowded mortuaries, many corpses lie stacked on the floor because relatives cannot get the necessary paperwork for the release of the deceased. Border posts are badly affected and so are airports, where numerous flights have been cancelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare hospital nurses, angry at their 6% raises when they had been led to believe they would get 20%, started the strike which one day later had spread throughout the civil service. The government said it was illegal and ordered the strikers to return to work before negotiations could begin. When the workers rejected this, they were all sacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't take kindly to illegal strikes,&quot; said Mugabe. &quot;Already the public service is far too large and it may be an opportunity for us to reduce it.&quot; Despite his remarks, Mugabe is expected to authorise negotiations with the strikers. Government doctors have been on strike four times in the past six years and on two occasions the government fired them, only to re-hire them a few days later.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - When President Robert Mugabe returned to Harare last weekend from his brief honeymoon in Cape Town and an even briefer South African Development Community summit stopover in Maseru, it was immediately clear that things would never be quite the same again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of the solitary figure of the president proceeding down the red carpet on the airport tarmac to receive the greetings of his ministers and armed services chiefs, there was now a first family basking in the glow of the television lights. As Mugabe moved crisply down the line -- a mandatory rollcall for those with any hope of advancement -- - he was followed not only by his new wife, Grace, but also by his son, Robert Jr (6), who was offering his hand to the bowing courtiers. An older boy -- unfamiliar to Zimbabwean viewers but almost certainly part of a yet-to-be- screened episode of this ongoing soap opera -- then whisked young Robert off to a waiting car. This rather endearing picture was one of several images -- scenes from a wedding if you like -- that have captivated Zimbabweans over the past fortnight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starved of information other than sanitised puff pieces appearing in the official media, the chattering classes are devouring every new detail they can find concerning the president and his 31-year- old bride with unprecedented enthusiasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a hagiographical press calls &quot;the wedding of the century&quot; on August 17 itself spawned a multitude of eye-witness accounts. Twelve thousand people were invited and nearly 40 000 turned up, placing a severe strain on amenities. Many invited guests were unable to find seats in the little church at Kutama Mission which had been occupied by well-wishers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe was not amused, observers said, at being kept waiting in the hot sun outside the church by Catholic archbishop Patrick Chakaipa who conducted the service. His mood was not helped by the huge cheer for Nelson Mandela that went up when the South African president arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bride, former presidential secretary Grace Marufu, arrived in an elderly white Rolls Royce with the sticker &quot;Eastlea Panelbeaters&quot; clearly visible. Fortunately, a more recent model was available for the couple's departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the service, diplomats and other VIPs went hungry in the huge bridal tent because much of the food prepared and frozen by State House chefs weeks before had gone off. Beef stew and rice was available to guests robust enough to face the melee around the buffet tables while visiting heads of state on a raised dais tucked into sauteed prawn cocktails in peri-peri sauce -- in honour of the best man, president Joachim Chissano of Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, security officers had difficulty preventing gatecrashers from removing the cutlery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While much of the wine served in the bridal tent was imported from the Cape, Zimbabwean wine producers rose to the occasion by manufacturing a little vintage of their own. It was called Bliss! Bottles are now collectors' items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most significant revelation on the president's wedding day were the official photographs showing two bright and lively children -- little Bona (8) and Robert (6), hitherto only referred to in media speculation. An older boy also appears to be part of the first family, clearly pre-dating Mugabe's relationship with Marufu which started in the mid- 1980s. He is said to be a boarder at a smart private school south of Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the secrecy surrounding the relationship it is hardly surprising that it should generate speculation. The honeymoon in Cape Town was only disclosed after the independent press was alerted by South African sources, and the official media still refuse to refer to it at all. The cost of a suite at the Cape Sun, not to mention the use of an Air Zimbabwe aircraft, have not yet been added to the estimated Z$6,5-million (nearly R3- million) spent on the wedding, at least a third of which will be charged to the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar media blackout has been ordered on the current wave of public service pay strikes -- the biggest mass action in the country's history -- which greeted Mugabe on his return from the honeymoon. Asked to comment, the rather bewildered president said he had no idea what the public servants were striking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers suggest Mugabe is increasingly out of touch with events on the ground and has yet to accept the connection between the misdirection of state resources and the hardship that afflicts ordinary Zimbabweans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Happy at least in his private life and cosseted by media that block out unpalatable truths, the president, it would seem, is not about to allow reality to intrude just yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile many of the old guard lined up on the airport tarmac are probably reflecting upon an uncertain future. In a society with few democratic constraints upon the exercise of power, newcomers with direct access to the president are likely to enjoy unlimited opportunity to influence the course of events. That is bound to shake things up among Zimbabwe's ossified hierarchy and means the new first family, whatever its inclination to secrecy, will continue to be the subject of legitimate curiosity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monrovia - For the first time since the beginning of the civil war in 1989, the news from Liberia is good rather than bad. At the close of a summit meeting in Abuja, the Nigerian capital -- which last week brought together the heads of state of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) and the leaders of the various armed factions in Liberia -- Ruth Sando Perry was appointed president of the Liberian Council of State. Perry, who is in her fifties, is the first woman to head an African country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months after the end of the terrible fighting that devastated the Liberian capital, Monrovia, Perry will not find it easy to implement the timetable for a return to peace and democracy hammered out in Abuja. It is due to culminate with the election of a new president on May 31, 1997, once the tens of thousands of fighters who have been ravaging the country for more than five years have been disarmed and demobilised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The composition of the rest of the Council of State remains unchanged. It includes three faction leaders: Charles Taylor of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, Alhaji Kromah of the Mandingo wing of the United Liberation Movement and George Boley of the Liberian Peace Council, as well as a representative of the civilian population and a customary chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new president, who is a former senator, promised in an interview on BBC radio that she would not be bribed or intimidated by threats of military action, and that she was expecting her colleagues to show her &quot;the respect due to a mother&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heads of state in Abuja threatened -- - for the first time -- to impose sanctions on any faction leaders who failed to respect the summit's decisions.  Taylor, Boley, Kromah, Johnson and their families, who until recently used to go to Conakry or Abidjan on shopping expeditions or to get medical treatment, may find they are no longer authorised to travel in the region unless they toe the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would appear the United States has promised to come up with the necessary finance to strengthen Ecomog -- the West African security force -- which is due to grow from 8 500 to 18 000 men in the next two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mediating force will continue to consist almost entirely of Nigerian nationals and to be headed by a Nigerian- appointed general.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The old and the crippled, the blind and the lame of Nyanga and beyond in the Western Cape are furious with Welfare Department officials, who they say make their already tough lives a nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They want to tell the politicians they are not getting the grants they were promised which are all they have to buy their daily bread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emanuel Ngxangxa (73), chairman of the Nyanga Pensioners' Forum, says he is convening a meeting of the pensioners' forums from all over the Western Cape next week, where they will discuss a march to parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are getting worse and worse,&quot; he says at the Zolani Centre in Nyanga where pensioners gather on Tuesdays to get their pension documents reviewed by officials. Reviews have to take place yearly. If a review fails or the documents aren't submitted for review, the grants are stopped.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People start queueing here at four in the morning, and look,&quot; Ngxangxa says pointing at his watch, &quot;the officials have only arrived now and it is ten to ten already and they say that they will only deal with 180 people ...  and they will be gone by three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large crowd has assembled in one of two halls in the Zolani Centre. Women with babies on their backs, pensioners and disabled people are pushing forward to the stage upon which four officials stand with piles of ID books on a table. The officials call out names -- those who would be seen that day.  The crowd surges forward. The officials are young, well- dressed and brook no nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once finished, the lucky 180 who were called out by name grab chairs and blankets, and storm to the next hall. There they will sit all day, waiting to have their forms processed by the officials. Even then, many will be turned away for not having the right documents or for failing the newly introduced means test, which calculates whether an individual is poor enough to receive a pension or a grant. Few of them understand the means test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 400 people are left in the first hall, many clutching their documents in the hope that there may be some mistake, and the official might come back and call their names. Some flow out of the hall in to the courtyard and accost Ngxangxa to complain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ida (60) has been waiting since 1994 for a disability grant. She comes every month in a desperate bid to get into the second hall. Once again she has not made the right queue. Gladys is a mother of four. She has no husband.  This is the last month in which she can have her maintenance grant reviewed, before it is stopped. But the officials will not see her today, and she will now lose her grant altogether and have to apply from scratch. Reapplication means submitting a host of documents and a three-month wait while they are processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women pull packets out of their bras, and unwrap them slowly, to expose dog- eared documents: ID books, husbands' death certificates, children's birth certificates, receipts and doctors' statements -- the documentation of their lives, guarded in their ample bosoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She is very angry,&quot; says Ngxangxa who is translating Ida's diatribe, &quot;she is so angry with the government. Rose Sonto is our MP and she has come here once and nothing changed ... hey, they are so angry,&quot; and then he starts shaking with disbelieving giggles as does the crowd that has gathered around him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the midst of this, a shout goes up in the hall and suddenly there is a clamour. A young, shapely woman in tight pants pushes her way out of the hall with a small pile of ID documents, leaving a storm behind her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She came to get some more people, and she just chose the ones she knew ...  it's not fair, she selected the wrong people,&quot; a woman explained as the brouhaha died down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, look,&quot; shout some of the women, &quot;look, here is an old lady, it's disgusting ...&quot; The crowd parts to reveal in its midst a hunched, wizened woman who is half the size of her neighbours. She shuffled forward in her slippers to talk to us. She leans heavily on a walking stick and talks in a whisper, eyes downcast, stopping to wipe tears away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her younger neighbours take up her cause. &quot;She has been here since early this morning, since five o' clock this morning, and nobody has taken care of her. She is 80, and nobody cares.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the women press round to express their outrage, an elderly man stands against the stage, staring at his ID book, turning the pages over and over again. On his chest is pinned a green and yellow badge with a picture of the old man, President Nelson Mandela, raising a clenched fist.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The most vulnerable groups in South Africa -- the poor, the elderly, the disabled and the abandoned -- are being hit hard by burgeoning problems in social security offices across the country, as they struggle to claim their state grants from demoralised, ill-informed and sometimes deceitful civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the implementation of the new Social Assistance Act and the botched amalgamation of 16 apartheid-defined welfare systems into a single national body has further weakened the system which was already seriously flawed as a result of apartheid administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands qualifying for assistance have been forced to wait months this year before receiving their grants and the situation on the ground, according to the Black Sash and sources in the Welfare Department, is getting worse as the backlogs build up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Particularly hard-hit by the inefficiencies of the combined new and old application and payment systems are pensioners and the disabled, although the picture varies from province to province and is dependent on regional social security offices and how they are coping with restructuring.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A well-placed source in the Welfare Department said this week: &quot;It's completely chaotic, staff feel demoralised and undermined, and the amalgamation programme which combines the social assistance systems of all 16 of the previous administrations is lagging more than a year behind schedule. .  .. Further, the computer system which is meant to connect up all regional offices is currently not working and so there are huge bottlenecks of angry people building up -- people who have been waiting for months for their pay- outs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network which is meant to regulate grant pay-outs nationally was meant to be implemented by March, but Q-data, the company installing it, says it won't be in place until the end of September because of glitches. This has meant that many qualifying for grants have to wait until the network is working, and their particulars can be entered into the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q-data's divisional director Assie van Aswegen was defensive: &quot;Some people are spreading bad news ... one of our problems is that welfare personnel are leaving so quickly that we find we train up people and then they go and we have to train up more. There were no filing systems in some provincial offices and we have had to track down documents and have them verified before entering data and these things slow us down ... there was also a technological difference between systems in different areas ... the situation is very fragile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts by the Mail &amp; Guardian to speak to the provinces about problems have failed, with the provincial directors silenced by an embargo from Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's special advisor, Rev Frank Chikane, head of the committee charged with overseeing the national restructuring of social security services. The committee comprises all the provincial health and welfare chief directors and the director general of the Welfare Department, Leila Patel. It has been told not to talk to the press about certain elements of restructuring until the new system is functioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Sash has articulated the greatest concern. Workers in their offices say provincial and national welfare departments are not responsive enough to problems and information about changes is not forthcoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation has been exacerbated by the fact that new regulations governing social assistance were introduced on March 1, along with the implementation of the Social Assistance Act of 1992, and the changes have not been properly explained to the public or to civil servants. The new means test, is, according to sources, causing logistical problems and is being reviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of the Grahamstown Black Sash advice office, Rosemary Smith, said there were enormous backlogs of pensioners waiting for their money and the process of application for pensions was painfully slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We monitored one office where one man was filling in forms really slowly in ink and it was said that he only did two a day, while there was a long queue of people filling the room. It was Dickensian ... and in another office there were files practically cascading off the shelves ... the government offices are really short- staffed and it is worse in the rural areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith took a case of maladministration in the Welfare Department to the public protector five months ago, but has still received no response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of the Black Sash office in Port Elizabeth, Laura Best, said queues, day and night, outside social security offices were the norm, with people sleeping under cars to be at the front of the queue in the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't feel a great responsiveness from the government at Bisho ... we have tried at different levels to get meetings with the director but they are always cancelled ... and the frustration is definitely mounting up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Best said that loansharks -- &quot;skoppers&quot; -- were thriving, and when the money dried up, they took pensioners' ID books as surety. It had reached a point, she said, where places for the loan sharks were reserved at the front of the queues so they could claim pensions as the first business of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of the Black Sash office in Durban, Seema Naran, said: &quot;Things were always pretty bad, but they seem to have got a lot worse. ... in reality on the ground we are dealing with the old apartheid administrations and at the moment they are refusing to talk to each other as there is a power play between them. ... Furthermore, the officials are not using the new regulations and are still quoting the old ones as reference ... the whole transformation of the department is not trickling down to the bottom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naran also pointed out that fraud was rife, with people going as far as to present clerks with chickens or livestock if they do not have money for bribes. She said an officer investigating pensions fraud had been shot in December and a pensions clerk who was to testify in a fraud case was gunned down in the same month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Welfare has responded by saying that most of its problems are inherited, but it is working hard to alleviate them. It estimates 10% of the R12,4-billion allocated for social assistance yearly is absorbed by corruption and inefficiencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department points out that Mpumulanga, Kangwane and Kwandebele have been success stories, and that the restructuring committees, headed by Chikane, will be making recommendations to the minister of welfare, Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The day of judgment had come. Yet there was no air of anticipation in the courtroom. No murmurs of approval in the gallery as the judge delivered his verdict. Not a single family member to sniffle as he was taken down to the cells. In fact, it was the kind of denouement that could have ruined the entire show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a courtroom series that took 18 months and cost at least R5-million to produce, the judge asked Eugene de Kock to stand up in the dock and, in just two minutes, summarised his judgment: guilty of six murders, two counts of conspiracy to murder, one of attempted murder, one of culpable homicide, one of abduction, one of serious assault, one of being an accessory to culpable homicide, one of defeating the ends of justice, nine of illegal arms and ammunition possession; and 66 of fraud.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the old days these multiple crimes -- a total of 89 counts, probably more serious than one person has ever been convicted of in South Africa, would have warranted the hangman's noose or at least a sentence of 200 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet De Kock sat down without flinching. A group of bored schoolkids who had been sent to write up a project about the case shuffled out of court clutching pens and notebooks. And the legal teams got down to planning, in a matter-of-fact way, their next episode: the one that everyone in court knows is going to be the blockbuster which will probably justify the extravagant costs of this drama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 16 Colonel de Kock, a man who has described himself as the most accomplished of the many assassins who executed the apartheid government's covert wars, will explain why he did these gruesome things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political ideals, fears of a communist take-over, violent bush wars in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South West Africa (now Namibia), battle fatigue and shock, instructions from the political hierarchy ... all of these factors will be woven into a personal narrative that could turn this country's recent history into the stuff of a Frederick Forsyth thriller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mitigation hearings will also have serious implications for other political murderers and assassins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock has already stated he will, as part of his explanation for the murders he has confessed to carrying out, give evidence implicating at least eight generals from the old security forces. Whether this information extends to members of the National Party Cabinet and the State Security Council remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here there is an intricate interplay with the workings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. That organisation's investigative unit has issued subpoenas to seven of the men De Kock could point out: Generals Johan van der Merwe, Mike Geldenhuys, Johan Coetzee -- all former police commissioners -- and Basie Smit, Krappies Engelbrecht, Johan le Roux and Bertus Steyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing is convenient. If the generals lie, or fail to volunteer significant details about their role in covert operations, they could well be caught out when De Kock begins to talk next month. This will effectively minimise the generals' chances of lodging successful applications for amnesty before the cut- off date, thus placing them under strong pressure to come clean when they begin answering questions in camera to the truth commission on Friday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The colonel will also talk about his involvement in the supply of weapons, ammunition and explosives to leading members of the Inkatha Freedom Party in the early 1990s, war material that may well have been used to account for the huge number of murders committed during the low key civil war that still rages in that province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP senator Philip Powell, former KwaZulu police minister CJ Mthetwa and IFP heavyweights in Gauteng, Humphrey Ndlovu and Themba Khoza have all been implicated in the supply of weaponry to Inkatha's self protection units and will be holding their breaths when the Pretoria Supreme Court hearings open on September 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the true importance of De Kock's mitigation hearings lies not in political significance or the entertainment value of the event. They will, probably more than any judicial process ever held in this country, provide a nation desperate to come to terms with its violent past the opportunity to hear and understand -- from a member of the inner circle of Pretoria's &quot;total war&quot; strategists -- why they did the things they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, Justice William van der Merwe will have to take into account De Kock's own testimony, as well as that of a psychologist and criminologist, when he decides at the end of the hearings on what kind of punishment to hand down to the self-confessed killer. Although the comparison is both inaccurate and cliched -- it will be the closest that South Africa has come to an Eichmann trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This places an enormous burden on the judge. He will have to come up with a sentence that is not only balanced, but one that, he has indicated, will have taken into account the broader political imperative of the times: to understand and forgive if this can promote national reconciliation without undermining a culture that respects human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By taking into account De Kock's social, psychological and political background, Justice Van der Merwe's sentence could end up using the key &quot; proportionality&quot; test contained in internationally accepted principles on how to prosecute war crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will have to decide whether the acts that De Kock committed -- including conspiracies to murder friends and colleagues who either told or threatened to tell the truth about the activities of his Vlakplaas unit at the time and gruesome ways of disposing of victims' bodies by burning them or blowing them up into tiny pieces -- were in proportion to the political motives and the mindset that drove him to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge has already indicated that, during the mitigation hearings, he wants to deal with issues like this that are beginning to shape the jurisprudence of post-apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will weigh up any evidence that De Kock presents about the political nature of his activities, especially with regard to the charges of gun- running to Inkatha, before he delivers sentence. He has also made it clear that witnesses who gave evidence against De Kock will not automatically be granted indemnity against prosecution for crimes they were personally involved in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means he could refuse to protect hitmen like &quot;Chappies&quot; Kloppers and Joe Mamasela, who are now receiving material benefits from the Justice Department, including witness protection and monthly stipends, just because they gave evidence against their former colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way this matter is handled will have a crucial bearing on how the judicial system's need to induce informants to come out of the woodwork is married with the creation of a culture that refuses to reward people who abuse human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The De Kock trial falls outside the ambit of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. But, just as that body was set up to do, the marathon case could help find the elusive formula to promote reconciliation and respect for all those who died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it succeeds, the taxpayers' R5-million may have been worth it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Some foreign and local doctors are smouldering at the red- carpet treatment handed out to the Cuban doctors. A second batch of Cubans arrived from Havana last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disgruntled at their Cuban colleagues' welcome, foreign doctors who have been working here for years complain they are being treated like unwanted slaves in comparison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a group of private South African doctors has sent a wad of complaints to the Interim National Medical and Dental Council, alleging malpractice by three Cuban doctors at Kuruman hospital in the Northern Cape.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrival of the Cuban doctors (210 altogether) is part of a government- to- government agreement -- the health department's latest policy in responding to the shortage of doctors. Rather than encouraging individual doctors from all over the world to work here, the government is arranging &quot; batches&quot; of doctors from particular countries. So far another agreement has been struck with Germany, but only four willing doctors have sufficient experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department has begun to stop doctors from other African countries coming here as there has been friction with some of those countries, notably Zimbabwe, scared of losing their health professionals. The quality of the training of many of these doctors has also been found wanting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were getting large numbers of applicants from African countries. The council felt we were taking doctors away from other countries to the detriment of their health services,&quot; said the registrar of the Interim National Medical and Dental Council, Nico Prinsloo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of 1 991 foreign doctors living in South Africa last year, 597 were African, 531 from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and 501 from East European countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council has also put the brakes on foreign doctors arriving to work here in their individual capacity. A moratorium has been placed on the examinations to evaluate foreign doctors. Instead, the council evaluates them by visiting countries where agreements have been made and giving the doctors oral exams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prinsloo said the advantage of the new system is that doctors can be placed where they are needed. &quot;In the past, foreign doctors didn't always stay where they were needed. They tended to go to the more attractive cities, rather than the rural areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the South African Foreign Doctors' Association charges that the doctors who have been working here for years in the ailing public sector are not being fairly treated and are beginning to leave in droves. Whereas there were 2 300 foreign doctors three years ago, there are now 1 700 (excluding the Cuban doctors.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The behaviour towards us is humiliating and insulting. We are being treated like slaves,&quot; said Dr Shahid Amin, based at Vereeniging hospital. &quot;We can't leave the hospital, we are forced to work long hours, and our career prospects are limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the government-to-government arrangement is working, we have no problem with it. And we welcome the Cuban doctors and anyone else who is joining the public sector. But we would like equal treatment for all the doctors. No one should be privileged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Safdar Malick, who is based at Sebokeng Hospital, said while Cuban doctors are provided with furnished residences and welcomed with banquets, other foreign doctors are made to feel unwelcome. Malick added that while Sebokeng hospital recently employed 40 doctors, it now has only 19 and is cracking under the strain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Director of Hospitals Tim Wilson said he is not aware of a major exodus of foreign or local doctors. Although 1 500 posts are still vacant, the Cuban doctors are making a significant difference in many places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want to negate the good work being done by other doctors -- both local and foreign -- in rural areas, but the Cubans are coming into vacant posts.We have to recognise that many of them are very senior people who have left their families behind. We need to say thank you for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kuruman, a group of doctors in private practice allege that 10 patients have been maltreated by Cuban doctors. But some local health workers believe this is a case of sour grapes because private GPs have lost their contracts to do state work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Cape regional health manager Marian Loveday said the Cuban doctors are &quot;more than up to scratch. We now have better service here than we've ever had before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuban Dr Noris Castro said she and &quot;all her comrades&quot; are not afraid of misinformation. &quot;We are doing our jobs very well. We did not come here for the money. We came because this country needs lots of doctors. Many of their own doctors are running away. We have come here to help the poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The leaked police &quot;working document&quot; at the centre of a row between police and Beeld newspaper is the work of old-order police spies who don't know the difference between Muslims and Hindus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaked to the press in the wake of Cape Town's People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) uprising, and believed to have formed the basis of initial briefings to the Ministry of Safety and Security and the Western Cape government, the report lists the Tamil Elam Support Movement as one of South Africa's &quot;Muslim extremist/ fundamentalist organisations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document also erroneously lists two African National Congress MPs -- one a communist party member -- as part of the movement's &quot;structures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movement comprises a group of Tamil- speaking South Africans who want to raise support for Sri Lankan Tamils. Hindu is the predominant religion of the Tamil- speaking community, and Tamil-speaking Muslims are virtually non- existent in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC MP and SACP member Yunus Carrim and KwaZulu-Natal MP Yusuf Bhamjee this week slammed the report's allegations that they formed part of the movement's &quot;structures&quot; and that they had told a December 1995 meeting of the group that some local Tamils &quot;are prepared to undergo a military type of training to enable them to help the Tamils in Sri Lanka&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrim and Bhamjee said the meeting had comprised &quot;members of our constituency&quot;, and its thrust was a decision to approach President Nelson Mandela to help seek a negotiated settlement in Sri Lanka's civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrim said the report raised &quot;serious questions about the quality of our intelligence. The most minimum rudimentary work hasn't been done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confronted with the apparent innacuracy of the report from his unit, Internal Security Division Commissioner Leonard Radu said: &quot;You don't know what (Carrim and Bhamjee) are doing in their evenings&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the document was &quot;not a report, but a document prepared to give training to the people who will run (new police intelligence desks probing religious extremism).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of the Western Cape religious expert Farid Esack said the questionnaire and &quot;guidelines for handlers&quot; at the back of the report suggested almost any Muslim could be seen as a suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slating the report as &quot;the work of a very dumb Afrikaner&quot;, Esack said: &quot; This is a manifestation of the swart gevaar, the rooi gevaar, the gut-level instinctual fear of a rural Afrikaner. It's like in the 1950s and 1960s when they saw a communist under every bush and even Helen Suzman was a communist.  Now they see a Muslim version of communism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out some of the inaccuracies in the report, which include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Africa has the largest Muslim population. Esack said Asia has a much larger Muslim population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* South Africa has a &quot;large number&quot; of Muslims. Esack said Muslims account for only 1,32% of South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Hizbullah originated in Iran, and its South African support base is centred in the Western Cape, Gauteng and KwaZulu- Natal. Esack said Hizbullah originated in Lebanon, and is &quot;too busy waging its own struggle to worry about Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed to a contradiction in the report on when Hizbullah was formed in South Africa. The report says it was formed in the &quot;latter half&quot; of 1994, but also states that it opposed the April 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esack said he knows only &quot;one man who claims to be South African Hizbullah, and he is even considered a joke by Qibla&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The leader of the organisation Qibla is advocate Samuel Jappie. Esack said Jappie is not an advocate and is &quot;an avowed secularist -- he doesn't even pray on Fridays&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Qibla received military training from Pakistan and its members had participated in the Lebanon conflict. Esack said these claims are &quot;bollocks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rachis Ormar heads the Islamic Unity Convention's &quot;military base&quot; in Cape Town. Esack said he knew of no such Muslim, and he hoped the report was not referring to Rashid Omar, who &quot;is the most progressive Muslim in South Africa&quot; . Omar is a former Muslim Youth Movement president and was the first imam to allow women to preach in a South African mosque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esack said the report also shows an ignorance of broader South African politics. It refers to the Pan Africanist Congress as a &quot;black concious (sic) movement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It lumps together deeply religious people who have nothing to do with fundamentalism with people who are disillusioned with the PAC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report claims &quot;Qibla members who are aligned to black conscious movements like the PAC&quot; frequent training camps of the Foundation for Islamic Tarbiyyah. The Tarbiyyah is, in fact, a conservative group which began providing self-defence training to Muslims in in the run-up to the 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also claims the Port Elizabeth Malabar mosque under Muslim &quot;priest&quot; AS Desai is the &quot;most active&quot; in the Unity Convention's &quot;military defence structures&quot;. This, other Muslim observers pointed out, despite the fact that Desai is virulently anti-Iranian, while the Unity Convention is seen to be sympathetic to Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esack de-scribed Desai as &quot;the personification of Is-lamic traditionalism.  He leads the Majlis Ul Ulama, the AWB (Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging) of Muslims: they are worried about protecting their mothers and daughters from the kaffirs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Intelligence Agency co-ordinator Mo Shaik said the agency is aware the document is a &quot;poor effort&quot; which reflects the need for transformation of the intelligence agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mpumalanga attorney general's office subpoenaed Beeld this month on behalf of the police after the newspaper published a story emanating from the report. The police are seeking the origins of the leak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National SAPS spokes-person Director Reg Crewe said this week he understood the subpoena against Beeld is still valid, as it follows &quot;separate circumstances&quot; from those which led to the Western Cape subpoenas against several newspapers and news agencies in connection with the recent Pagad march.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A string of sexy films heading for South Africa is set to test the mettle of the censorship board and its successor under the new Publications Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the charge will be Crash which, according to one local reviewer, involves &quot;as much high-velocity sex as (there are) high-velocity car crashes&quot;.  Nu-Metro, the film's importer, was so anxious about its move into risque territory that it invited reviewers at the preview to jot down their comments before leaving.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crash -- which goes on circuit next week with an 18, sex violence and nudity rating -- and the other films arrive at a time when elements in the African National Congress are pushing for tighter censorship laws. There will probably be many in the ruling classes who will frown upon those films which portray sex between teenagers, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the films, many of which have proved controversial in Europe and the United States, will also enter what is effectively a censorship no man's land.  The old board is winding down and expects to hand over to a new Film and Publications Board by the beginning of next year, assuming Parliament gives the new Publications Bill the green light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the missiles aimed at the censorship board are Doom Generation and Kids, which involve hefty doses of teenage sex and drug abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libby Gelman-Waxner summed up Kids in the American Premiere magazine: &quot;A day in the life of a gang of teenagers who spend their time hanging out, skateboarding, bashing people, puffing monster joints and having sex with virgins&quot;. The film came top at the American alternative Sundance Festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also heading for South African screens is Lie Down with Dogs which, according to one reviewer, has a strong undertone of bestiality running through it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new rules, the Film and Publications Board will be able to ban for distribution films which include child sex, explicit violent sexual conduct and bestiality. According to the Bill, child sex involves a person under the age of 18 (or presented as being under age) engaging in or helping another person to engage in &quot;sexual conduct&quot; or &quot;a lewd display of nudity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the amendments introduced by the parliamentary committee was the addition of &quot;degrading sex&quot; into the XX category, after pressure from ANC MPs driven by a strong women's lobby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Freedom of Expression Institute this week called on Parliament not to pass the Bill, which looked like a &quot;rushed job&quot;. It objected to, among other clauses, the Bill's move to broaden the categories of pornographic material banned for possession.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Shocking information about children in prisons in the Western and Northern Cape emerged this week. Julia Sloth-Nielsen of the Community Law Centre at the University of the Western Cape visited Kimberley Prison and found most of the children there were not being held for serious crimes. In terms of the law, they should not have been held in prison.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no reformatory in Kimberley and three children in the prison were waiting to be transferred to a facility in Cape Town, hundreds of kilometres away from their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 16-year-old girl awaiting transfer to a reformatory was brought to the prison at the request of her mother. The reason for the request was that the girl had allegedly been raped by a policeman while in police custody. The matter is being investigated by the local Child Protection Unit,&quot; Sloth- Nielsen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said not a single child had been visited by a lawyer while being held in the prison, and some had reported that they had not seen a social worker or probabtion officer before being sent to prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Kimberley police cells, she found 10 children, two of whom would next appear in court on October 28. There were no recreational or educational facilities available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amendments to the Correctional Services Act in May stipulate that juvenile court cases cannot be postponed for more than 14 days. But Sloth-Nielsen found they often were, with magistrates making arrangements for children to be brought to court every 14 days without their dockets. &quot;It is somewhat cynical to postpone a case for three months, with informal arrangements to bring the child back to court for a pro forma appearance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Community Law Centre researcher, Nomfundo Ntloko, visited Pollsmoor prison in the Western Cape this month and found 86 juveniles in detention.  They were locked in their cells from 3.30pm until 8.30am. There was only one TV set for juveniles, which circulated from cell to cell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disturbingly, many of the children were aware of prison gangs and some had gang tattoos on their hands. &quot;One of the boys we spoke to had carved a tattoo on his hand and the wound had only just started healing. The boy was 14 years old,&quot; said Ntloko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children complained of a gang which encouraged sodomy, and some said they had witnessed a boy being raped two weeks before Ntloko's visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Correctional Services Sipo Mzimela has accused the Department of Welfare of &quot;dumping&quot; children in prisons to get them out of the way. He discovered recently that 62% of the 398 children awaiting trial in prison should not be there because they were not accused of committing serious crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welfare Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi has responded by announcing that secure accommodation for children awaiting trial will be available from November in Gauteng, Northern Province and Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice has been accused of not interpreting the Act correctly and allowing magistrates to keep awaiting- trial juveniles in prisons for lengthy periods.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Joseph Mdluli's death in detention in Durban 20 years ago made international headlines. His son, who was in detention at the time, later told a judge during the trial of the late Harry Gwala he had heard the name &quot;Joseph&quot; being shouted round the prison one night. It was only later he discovered it was that night his father had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This and several other high-profile skeletons crept out of KwaZulu-Natal's apartheid cupboard this week, as the Truth and Reconciliation Committee (TRC) heard testimony around some of the most pivotal human rights abuses in the province's history.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of South Africa's most notorious deaths in detention will be the focus of Friday's hearings in Durban when Khanyisile Mdluli (63) testifies about the 1976 alleged murder of her husband, former Umkhonto weSizwe commander Joseph Mdluli, at the hands of security police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mdluli will tell the tale of the fateful night when a group of security police came and took her husband away. First hearing of his death two days later from the local rumour-mill, Mdluli found his battered body in a box in Durban's Gale Street mortuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official reports first linked the death to a fall from a chair and later to a heart attack. But an undertaker had taken a picture of Mdluli's terribly battered body which underground African National Congress members smuggled out of the country. Harassed by police after the picture focused international attention on South Africa, Mdluli waited three years for four policemen cited by the inquest magistrate to face trial for her husband's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policemen -- then captain David Van Zyl, lieutenant Andy Taylor, sergeant Mandlakayise Makhanya and constable Zablon Ngobese -- were let off by Natal's judge president. In a bittersweet irony, however, Taylor now faces charges for the 1981 murder of Durban human rights lawyer Griffiths Mxenge, who acted for Mdluli after her husband's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, the TRC also heard testimony related to the bloody aftermath of the 1985 murder of Mxenge's wife, Victoria, in Umlazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former United Democratic Front (UDF) activist David Gasa, and a former Umlazi cinema owner, Josiah Dlamini, told the commission how the massacre of 15 UDF supporters during Victoria Mxenge's memorial service at the cinema unleashed a &quot;reign of terror&quot; in the sprawling township and wreaked havoc on both their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men alleged an impi of Inkatha Freedom Party supporters led by the late IFP Umlazi warlord Winnington Sabello, and recently expelled IFP MP Thomas Shabalala, invaded the cinema during a prayer service organised days before Mxenge's funeral and killed 15 people with assegais. They alleged police and soldiers assisted the IFP in the attack. Truth commissioner Richard Lyster said the massacre was one of the most important events of the 1980s, after which &quot;this province entered one of its darkest eras as the State of Emergency was declared&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasa testified that when he returned home from the funeral four days after the vigil and went to sleep, he awoke to the feeling that &quot;heaven was falling on my house ... the house was on fire&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasa said he found himself covered in flames and he and his wife barely managed to escape by hooking a hose to the kitchen faucet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He blamed televised statements made by then IFP secretary general Oscar Dhlomo for &quot;unleashing the irritation of the IFP&quot; on his family, which he believed led also to the second arson attack on his home, the stabbing death of his daughter, and ultimately, to the death of his wife six months later: &quot; I think my wife would still be alive if it weren't for Dhlomo's statement,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dlamini said he had lost a son and suffered harassment at the hands of the IFP after allowing the UDF structures to use his cinema for Mxenge's memorial service. He also alleged his son was killed by IFP supporters who attacked him while he waited for a taxi in Lindelani: &quot;He mentioned my name. That's when they decided to kill him because they said I organised a memorial for Victoria Mxenge,&quot; said Dlamini.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The truth commission says its first amnesty is imminent, but old-guard perpetrators are still reluctant to bare their souls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressure on Justice Minister Dullah Omar to amend the Truth and Reconciliation bill and change the rules of amnesty is growing, as dissatisfaction with the process increases among those who served the apartheid government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while many are deliberately shunning the amnesty limelight, human rights lawyer Brian Currin has spoken out on their behalf:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amnesty system is not working and the ball is in the court of the minister of justice. The first step he must take now is to ensure that all prosecutions are put on hold pending the outcome of the amnesty applications, should the accused want to apply for amnesty. Otherwise people will not come forward.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest of former security operative Dirk Coetzee has compounded the unease of many potential amnesty applicants who fear that by confessing all to the truth commission, they may be digging their own graves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added to that is the chilling realisation that apartheid leadership is not going to take responsibility for human rights abuses committed in the name of apartheid, as far as they can help it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as the truth commission deflected criticism this week by telling the Mail &amp; Guardian to address questions to the parliamentarians who authored the bill, so Omar deflected criticism, saying it was up to the commission to suggest changes to the legislation and the rules if it felt the amnesty process was snarling up. No such proposals, according to Omar, have been received by his department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not understand what responsibility the TRC cannot take. Any suggestion or proposal or recommendation emanating from the TRC will be considered,&quot; Omar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources within the African National Congress Justice committee indicate that there are informal discussions on a possible amendment, but it would be up to Omar to initiate such changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if Omar deflects the media this week, he will shortly have to face a troubled Freedom Front leader, General Constand Viljoen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I personally feel the whole idea of amnesty needs to be re-examined even if this means disregarding the legislation,&quot; Viljoen said. &quot;Look what happened to Coetzee. There is a major problem of the credibility of the system. The amnesty system is about reconciliation and we are fumbling with it, putting reconciliation at risk,&quot; Viljoen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sharp contrast to Viljoen's pro-active stand is National Party leader FW de Klerk's apathy towards the amnesty question. During last week's party submission, he hinted to the commission that more information from apartheid offenders could be forthcoming if the terms of amnesty were broadened.  However, this week his spokesman said he would not respond to any media questions, and was awaiting a response from the commission to his comments at the political party hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission says the granting of the first amnesty is imminent.  Currin believes the politicians are at fault for not encouraging people to apply for amnesty and for designing the amnesty system badly, and says the commission is at fault for not following through on promises for legal representation for applicants, and for not sorting out administrative problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claims incompleted or incomprehensible applications from prisoners are currently holding up the amnesty committee's proceedings. He suggested the commission send legal advisers with their forms, or commission staff.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currin also said no money had been forthcoming from the Legal Aid Board for legal representation for amnesty applicants, as promised by Omar.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Sasol has won an extraordinary case against a magistrate who ordered the synthetic fuel company to disclose documents relating to a devastating mining accident which killed 53 workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A commission of inquiry into the explosion -- which took place at the company's Middelbult colliery in 1993 -- was suspended last year when the magistrate chairing it, Mike Jungbluth, demanded Sasol hand over documents which included interviews about the accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol hit back saying the documents were confidential -- as they had been prepared for its lawyers -- and took the magistrate and the Chemical Workers' Industrial Union (CWIU), which also wanted the papers, to court.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers acting for the union this week expressed great disappointment at the result, but said the CWIU wanted to see Pretoria Supreme Court Judge Pierre Roux's written argument before considering an appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's legal team fears Sasol is using legal privilege to cover up the cause of the accident, claiming the company has yet to say what triggered the explosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge rejected the union's argument that Sasol had waived its privilege by showing the papers to the legal team representing the shift bosses who had been in charge at the time of the accident. The union reasoned that there were three separate sides at the inquest -- the company, the shift bosses and the workers. Sasol, however, argued the shift boss lawyers were working for Sasol so there was no breach of privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquest has so far examined whether the accident was caused by a methane explosion, or a coal-dust explosion which would imply Sasol was negligent. The CWIU says some of the international experts who spoke at the inquest said there had been a coal-dust explosion and blamed Sasol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol had a similar victory in the Supreme Court in 1989, when it succeeded in barring the attorney general from gaining access to secret documents relating to an explosion at a synthol plant in Secunda which left 13 workers dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol said this week it would like to see the speedy resumption of the commission. &quot;We are, however, not in a position to say when this will happen, as the matter is in the hands of the public prosecutor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A man who claims he was a victim of police torture will seek a place in South African legal history when he applies to the Constitutional Court next month for R200 000 in damages for the police's invasion of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntandazeli Fose says he was tortured by members of the Vanderbijlpark Riot and Related Crimes Investigation Unit on May 2 and 3 1994. He says the police punched and kicked his face, electrically shocked various parts of his body, tied him to a chair with a rope and hit him on the back with an object resembling an empty bottle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the legal first of asking the court to make the state pay for breaching constitutional rights, the challenge is noteworthy because Fose's lawyers are effectively asking the court to punish the state with the extra damages award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fose took Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi to court last year for R130 000 in damages for his suffering, his loss of enjoyment of life and past and future medical expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also asked for R200 000 in damages for the violation of his constitutional rights. Judge Rex van Schalkwyk rejected this damages claim, but agreed to pass the matter on to the Constitutional Court which will hear the case on September 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim includes an element of punitive damages, say Fose's lawyers. They argue the police invaded Fose's rights to human dignity and privacy, among others. They charge the police have treated others in the same way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi's legal team contends that the Constitution does not include a specific damages remedy for an invasion of constitutional rights. They also contend it is inappropriate to award damages in addition to those awarded by ordinary courts in terms of civil law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His lawyers claim the common law protects the same rights as the Constitution does. So there is no point in granting additional damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fose insists the matter cannot be left entirely to the common law which, unlike the Constitution, does not treat torture separately from assault.  Assault does not involve the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His team argues the award of damages for breach of constitutional rights would &quot;vindicate the importance of the constitutional guarantees prohibiting torture, deter the police from more torture and punish the state and its organs for this abuse of power&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - At Stellenbosch, blacks are running for office. And that's not the only thing that's different about this year's student elections. In a first for the new South Africa, political parties -- the African National Congress, the National Party and the Freedom Front --are taking part in student elections at the University of Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their participation has not been well- received by established student groups like the South African Students' Congress (Sasco) and the Azanian Students' Congress (Azasco).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephanie Allais, a Sasco education officer, questioned the role political parties would play in student representative councils (SRCs) and other student governance following the University of Pretoria lead, while agreeing they should be allowed to operate on campuses. She was worried that their participation might dissolve the impact of &quot;progressive voices,&quot; particularly on traditionally white, Afrikaans universities such as Tukkies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allais said: &quot;We view ourselves as allies (with the ANC Youth League), we are similar organisations. The issue (of participation by parties) will depend on campus to campus, but we don't understand what the role of the ANCYL will be. At Tukkies, for instance, we (ANCYL and Sasco) are competing against each other ... this weakens the chance of a progressive voice at conservative institutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However ANCYL national publicity and information secretary Thabo Masebe said the two organisations would still complement each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masebe said: &quot;We cannot expect our allies to do the work that the ANCYL should be doing. It is our responsibility to go to tertiary institutions and popularise the policies of the ANC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalli Kriel, who is co-ordinating the formation of a Freedom Front youth league, said the organisation decided to participate at Tukkies because it opposes transformation &quot;as it was being advocated at universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our policy ultimately is the creation of a volkstaat, but because we don't have that now, we will be more active at universities to preserve their Afrikaans character, which we feel is being threatened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NP national youth representative Annelize van Wyk said the involvement of &quot; political parties will result in much more responsibility among students, not to vandalise and trash campuses, because they'll be directly answerable to senior structures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP Youth Brigade chair Musa Zondi described direct involvement of political parties in student politics as &quot;a radical departure from the traditional norm, but maybe it is because of recent upheavals on campuses&quot;.  Zondi said the move by the ANC, NP and FF could bring South African universities in line with institutions in the United States and Britain, where party politicking is a well-established tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Swepu, national publicity secretary for Azasco, an affiliate of the Azanian People's Organisation said Azasco was opposed to political parties, particulary those that participated in the country's government, taking direct part in student politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile at the University of Stellenbosch, the studenteraad (SR) faces change on a different level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution of the Students' Union prevents students from standing for the SR elections if their academic results are poor. This has meant that black students have rarely stood for the SR. But this year for the first time, black students have been nominated to stand for the SR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, one of them, the Sasco branch chair, Xola Tsoba, has been disqualified from taking part in the elections on the basis of his academic record. The other student, also a Sasco candidate, is doing a master's degree, and did his undergraduate degree at another university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xola said students from disadvantaged backgrounds at Stellenbosch suffer because of the Afrikaans language policy on campus, and should not be prevented from taking part in student organisations because of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is going to happen for a long time unless we challenge the constitution, and the SR will remain the domain of white students.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasco feels this is a human rights issue and that the Stellenbosch constitution does not take into account the new Bill of Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xola's disqualification also highlights other problems at Stellenbosch, such as a lack of academic support for educationally disadvantaged students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darryl Wright, the present secretary of the SR, said Sasco has been encouraged to take up the issue through all possible channels. He said the new SR will have to review all the election procedures and propose structural changes. &quot;I do believe that access to the SR will be addressed. There are some dynamic leaders from disadvantaged backgrounds who are being prevented from making a contribution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the University of Cape Town (UCT), SRC elections were held this week after a year without an elected body. More than 20 candidates contested the elections. There was also concern that not enough students would vote to reach the 25% poll needed for a legitimate election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of interest by white students at UCT remained a major problem. Less than a third of the candidates were white, and only a handful attended the candidates' public presentation of their manifestos.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Evidence is mounting that corrupt police officers are at the heart of the country's escalating crime-wave, with worrying signs that some key law enforcers are linked to or masterminding criminal syndicates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say incidents such as the recent shooting of a police officer while taking part in a bank robbery at the Eastgate shopping centre in Johannesburg show that a climate of lawlessness exists within the South African Police Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Low salaries, lack of proper accountability and insufficient action against bad cops are among the reasons cited for the 8,1% increase in SAPS members investigated by the police anti- corruption unit since January. The allegations range from murder to taking bribes for the deliberate misplacement of case dockets --sometimes for as little as R100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other reported cases include the operation of rogue officers at the Soweto and Diepkloof vehicle pounds, where parts are stripped from recovered cars and then sold to &quot;chop shops'' or other black marketeers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complaints continue from members of the public despite the arrest of several suspects and the SAPS's promise to clean up its act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence also exists of extensive police collusion in vehicle hijackings and theft syndicates in Johannesburg and Durban where police have been accused of issuing clearance certificates for stolen vehicles, which are then legitimised and sold on the open market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And collusion between police and gang leaders is said to be at the heart of drug trafficking in the Cape which has sparked off vigilante activities from the group Pagad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of this crooked culture is a spin-off from the bad old days when the police wielded vast unaccountable power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the judge in the trial of former Vlakplaas security police commander Colonel Eugene de Kock said on Monday, it is clear that a police secret fund existed, which had been used as an almost inexhaustible source of financing for Vlakplaas members and other dirty tricks sections of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was used to pay for tax returns, the entertainment of spouses and merely to let them live in luxury,'' Justice Willie van der Merwe said. The secret police fund involved tens of millions of rands annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics believe that when the millions of rands dried up, some officers readily embraced criminality in order to supplement their meagre salaries -- some even claim it is part of a &quot;fourth&quot; force plan to discredit the new democratic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relaxation of the quasi-military hierachy of the past has also fuelled corruption, indiscipline and collusion with criminals. The result is a continued use of violence -- torture is still a popular procedure of getting evidence -- rather than sophisticated investigative methods of a democratic police service. This has undermined the country's crime fighting capabilities and allowed criminals to avoid capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So a brutal aparthied regime of yesterday which spawned mass murderers like De Kock also created an ethos which continues to hamper effective policing today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Gauteng police reporting officer, advocate Jan Munnick, says the police corruption units set up by the new government are merely touching the tip of the iceberg. &quot;You have only to look at the kind of homes some police officers have and the lifestyles they live to know they are up to no good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However he acknowleges that many of the crimes being committed are not reported or known about, so it is difficut to get a clear picture. &quot;I think it's a huge problem. Most of the 450 known crime syndicates have police working for them and that's why so few of these crime bosses get caught.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stef Grobler, head of the national police anti-corruption unit, argues that it is not that cops are much more corrupt &quot;but that we are becoming more aware of the corrupt practices&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the problem is not unique to the SAPS, but also a question of the general lawlessness that prevails throughout the country. Such a rising tide of criminality encourages a guy to close his eyes, extend his hand and collect a pay-off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the whole society has failed because the culture of corruption has grown over a long while. It's not new, we just did not identify it before,'' insisted Grobler. Indeed he points out that despite the increase in corrupt officers investigated over the past six months, they represents only 0,63% out of 140 000 SAPS members.&quot;That's just over half of a percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Bratton, the former New York Police commissioner credited with smashing crime and corruption among his men, says the situation is similar to that which existed in New York during the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then we had systematic corruption at all levels of the service. The remedy was to significantly change the internal affairs procedure and there were widespread sackings, including a number of senior officers,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When corruption again reared its head in the 1990s, Bratton says it was mainly pockets of crooked cops in the system. &quot;I set in motion very sophisticated sting operations to catch them, using high-tech equipment and sometimes outside investigative bodies. Only 1% of the 38 000 officers were involved with wrongdoings and we rooted them out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one instance an entire police precinct was sacked. Bratton said he used management powers which allowed him to move or fire people even if the case could not be proved against them in court, but the evidence was strong on a balance of probability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grobler points out that an officer cannot be fired in South Africa unless they do something illegal that can be proved in court, despite a draft proposal last year to shift it to a balance of probability, which provides more chances for convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Wilfried SchSrf, who was the civilain watchdog over police inquiries into senior police complicity with gangs in the Cape and director of the Institute for Criminology at UCT, says it is difficult to generalise as to whether corruption is endemic or is the result of a few bad apples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However we do know that it is fairly widespread. Clean cops are extremely angry and become demoralised by the fact that dirty cops still get protected and promoted. They say the signal is that they are being foolish and being clean also endangers their lives as they become victimised by dirty cops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Scharf, a senior dirty cop must have been protected by colleagues up and down the ladder for a long time. &quot;They often end up bribing colleagues to clear their personnel files of any blemishes in order to secure promotion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The level of collusion in the Cape is also a throwback to the apartheid period when police used gangs as informants against the liberation movements.  &quot;Now these police are senior officers and the gang members have become leaders. Their relationships still hold and this makes it difficult for the police to act resolutely against the gangs -- especially when some are on the payroll.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year National Police Commissioner George Fivaz said he would introduce psychological as well as lie detector tests to gauge trustworthiness of key personnel, especially in the vehicle pounds. His office says the process has started, but as yet no one has been caught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fivaz said he is committed to tackling the problem and accepts that there has been a &quot;substantial upsurge'' in police corruption, but insisted this was because the police were receiving more reports of bent cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Scharf and Munnick argue that the police must work harder to break the bond of solidarity and silence of complicity, which keeps corruption ingrained in the SAPS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This cop culture to protect colleagues is a world problem, but we need more personnel and better training and retraining to shrink the problem here,&quot; added Munnick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Growing List Of Arrested Officers (SIDEBAR)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - These are just some of the recent cases reported in the press of policemen who have fallen foul of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Three members of the flying squad at Thabong near Welkom in the Free State goldfields have been arrested in connection with a robbery at a hostel in the township. They allegedly stole R450 in cash before driving off in a police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A syndicate of truck hijackers, which included two serving policemen and three former policemen, terrorised truck drivers throughout the Free State for six months before being arrested after a brazen daylight heist went wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed in SAPS uniforms they forced their victims to stop by closing in on them in a vehicle with a flashing blue light, ordered drivers to leave their cabs, got in and drove away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A policeman allegedly raped a theft suspect at the Alexandra Police Station near Sandton last weekend. The off-duty officer was allegedly caught in the act by a colleague who went to get the woman's fingerprints and the alleged rapist was able to flee from the station.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Kwazulu-Natal learned this week that in the early 1990s it had its own version of the infamous Vlakplaas torture camp at Camperdown in the Midlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspended policeman Colonel Andy Taylor has been fingered as the man who headed the camp -- effectively a subsidiary of Vlakplaas -- in an investigation by a magistrate Ashin Singh, now working for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor, who is suffering from cancer, is one of the five policeman accused of murdering lawyer Griffiths Mxenge in 1981.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The farm -- which housed ANC operatives who were tortured and then turned into the police agents called Askaris -- is believed to have been the springboard for a host of assassinations, torture sessions and cross-border raids, according to an investigation published in the Natal Witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper quotes one of the camp's former Askaris, who is now providing information. The Natal Witness is also in possession of a number of documents about the farm's activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators have linked Taylor to the death of Askari Neville &quot;Goodwill&quot; Sikhakhane -- one of the people convicted mass murderer Eugene De Kock was accused of murdering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A list of the camp's top men includes Sergeant Larry Hanton, an explosives expert and Captain &quot;Spyker&quot; Myeza, believed to have been Taylor's right hand man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Askari said the farm was leased in Taylor's name. The camp's operatives acted on intelligence reports from police security branch units across the province. The Askaris and the black policemen at the camp would infiltrate the area, posing as MK operatives. Once they had identified their target they would either eliminate them or kidnap them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the information about the Camperdown operation and other farms leased by the police for anti-insurgency activities emerged in the De Kock trial and at the recent Motherwell hearings in Port Elizabeth, which lead to the conviction of several policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transvaal attorney general is in possession of an impressive amount of information about Taylor and his colleagues, and prosecutions may ensue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement it issued this afternoon, the commission said high level flood protection work has continued in Oromiya, Afar and South Ethiopia Regional States in which fruitful results were being registered in the move.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the success, the statement said the transportation of food and the necessary aid, mainly to Alem Tena, began Friday after the completion of the levelling of a new road that leads from Gefersa to Alem Tena, Dedemtu and Mekonnen Boka encampments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the level of water that flooded Tefki is on the decline, the statement said, some of the people who entered the encampment have begun returning to their home while the remaining are expected to return soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 42 km road enabling aid workers to transport goods from Dera to the Chaka temporary shelter was also constructed as part of the effort to rescue flood affected people, according to the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission reported that besides the three-horse-power boats sent to Gewane, in Afar, the transportation of two additional 25-horse-power boats began yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - This is number 24 (26 August - 1 September 1996) in a series of weekly reports from IRIN on general developments in the Great Lakes region.  Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The United Nations Security Council has given Burundi's new regime two months to hold broad-based peace talks or face punitive measures. In a resolution adopted unanimously on Friday, the Council expressed support for the sanctions imposed by Burundi's neighbours and other African states following the military-backed coup d'etat on 25 July. The Council called on all Burundian factions to stop hostilities and to initiate immediately unconditional negotiations &quot;with a view to reaching a comprehensive political settlement&quot;. The resolution provides for the Council to review Burundi's compliance with its demands on 31 October. Punitive measures may include an arms embargo or other sanctions. France, which finally voted in favour of the resolution, had fought a paragraph expressing strong support for the efforts of regional leaders, including the 31 July Arusha meeting where sanctions were declared. A proposal for an immediate arms embargo was also gradually watered down during negotiations on the text.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's new leader, Pierre Buyoya, said on Saturday that while he was ready to negotiate with Hutu rebels if they put down their arms, a decision on war or peace in Burundi would not be made by the UN Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Heavy fighting was reported in Gatara village in the northwest province of Kayanza and nearly a dozen government buildings were looted and burned on Saturday - one day before Burundi's new prime minister was due to visit. The fighting was reported on the state-run radio. No casualty figures were released. Rebels also continued to block the main road north from Bujumbura to the Rwandan border. Attacks in Kayanza region were also stepped up during the week. Two truck drivers were burned alive in their vehicles during a series of ambushes on the country's main national route one which runs through Kayanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Hutu peasants have accused the Burundian Army and Tutsi militia of killing more than 70 civilians in Murengeza village, about 20 kilometres north of Bujumbura. Eye-witnesses said that the Army and militia group, the Sans Echecs, shot, burned and used machetes to kill the villagers on 25 August during an operation to clear out rebels from the area. The Army says its troops killed 10 Hutu rebels but has denied slaughtering civilians. The human rights group, Amnesty International claimed last week that the Army had killed more than 4,000 unarmed civilians between 27 July and 10 August in the central district of Giheta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Burundi reported on Thursday that the new regime had asked the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to substantially increase the number of human rights monitors deployed in Burundi. Currently there are only five international human rights monitors funded by the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Officials at Burundi's state run electricity company told Reuters that rebels had pulled down pylons as engineers were about to restore power to Burundi's capital, Bujumbura. The city has largely been without power since Saturday 24 August when rebels cut power lines in northern Bubanza province.  The acts of sabotage have forced the capital to draw on dwindling fuel stocks for generators to keep water supplies, hospitals and schools running. As sanctions entered their second month, there were fresh warnings from doctors that a health disaster was imminent, particularly amongst the country's most vulnerable groups. Sanctions have forced the government to ration fuel and the cost of imported foods and goods have soared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional committee established to monitor the sanctions will meet for the first time this coming week in Arusha, Tanzania. The committee, comprising the Ambassadors and High Commissioners to Kenya of Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Zambia and Zaire will meet together with officials from the OAU. The mandate of the committee is to monitor the effect of sanctions. Under the terms of the sanctions only human medicines and food for Rwandan refugees are exempt. UN agencies and other humanitarian partners are continuing to press for a range of humanitarian goods and materials for Burundi's vulnerable groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), meanwhile, has denied threatening to attack planes breaking the air embargo. A spokesman for the CNDD said that no unilateral action on the ground or the air would be taken without prior consultation with the regional sanctions committee. WFP's internal flights, halted for two days were due to resume this coming week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The African Football Confederation (CAF) confirmed on Wednesday that Burundi had been disqualified from the African Nations Cup following the team's inability to travel for a qualifying round against Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Former Tanzanian president, Julius Nyerere, chief mediator of the Burundi crisis met with Italian Catholic peace organisation, Sant'Egidio in Rome on Wednesday. The organisation has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize for its work. Sant'Egidio representatives also met with Howard Wolpe, the US special representative to Burundi who was in Rome prior to vacationing in Italy. Nyerere and Wolpe also met in Rome on Wednesday. A source close to the meeting said that the two agreed that an &quot;exceptional diplomatic effort&quot; was required to bring forward acceptable proposals to defuse the conflict in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># A planned three-day census of Rwandan refugees in Goma, eastern Zaire was suspended on Sunday following what was described as &quot;a highly organised and orchestrated&quot; boycott by the refugees. No violence was reported but in Katale camp two sites where the census was supposed to have taken place were destroyed and plastic sheeting was stolen in Mugunga camp. UNHCR says that the census was organised to establish how many refugees were in the area so that aid could be better directed in the face of shortage of donor funds.  Earlier, the Rwandan Hutu refugee organisation, the Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda (RDR), had called on refugees to be calm and had asked UNHCR to avoid any &quot;policing approach&quot; and to calm refugees by explaining the aim of the operation. The RDR said the refugees feared the census because they believed it could be used to help force them back to Rwanda. Zaire and Rwanda recently announced plans for &quot;an organised, massive and unconditional repatriation&quot; of the 1.1 million Rwandan refugees in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># A statement issued by the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda says that the Rwandan Patriotic Army killed at least 111 people, many of them unarmed civilians, during sweeps carried out in five communes in Ruhengeri prefecture between 6-8 August. Some former soldiers, militia and cross border infiltrators were allegedly amongst those who were killed. About 300 males were arrested during the sweep, fifty-two of whom were still missing on 28 August. The regional Army commander says that civilian deaths occurred because people attempted to flee, resisted arrest or were caught in cross- fire between the RPA and insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda (RDR) accused the Government of Rwanda this week of terrorist acts on Rwandan refugees in Kenya. The RDR called on the international community for assistance and said that hit squads had been sent to many foreign capitals including Nairobi. It claimed that during the last three weeks four trucks belonging to Rwandan refugees in Kenya had been burned by people it suspected of being in the pay of the Rwandan government. The RDR statement also said there had been five assassination attempts on Rwandan refugees in Kenya last year. The Resistance Forces for Democracy (FRD), a group formed by former Rwandan Primer Minister Faustin Twagiramungu, on Tuesday also accused the Rwandan government of forming hit squads to assassinate Rwandan leaders in exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># A former Rwanda prefet, who is wanted in Rwanda, pleaded not guilty to being involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and other related crimes at a court in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on Wednesday. Colonel Alphonse Ntezilyayo is charged that while he was prefet of Butare he held meetings of Hutu Interahamwe militias and the presidential guard to plan massacres, helped killers escape to a safe zone controlled by French troops and later used death threats to force other Hutus to leave Rwanda. At his extradition hearing, Ntezilyayo said that he had only been prefet in Butare from 20 June to 2 July. The court will deliver its opinion on 4 September, but his extradition to Rwanda can only be ordered by Burkina Faso's President, Blaise Compaore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swiss authorities said on Wednesday that they had arrested a former Rwandan mayor now living in Switzerland on suspicion of violating human rights during the genocide. The man was not named, but the investigation is proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Zairian President, Mobutu Sese Seko remained in Switzerland this week, reportedly after undergoing an operation for cancer of the prostate.  Officials at the hospital where Mobutu is being treated would not confirm the operation. An official statement from Zaire said that Zaire's Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo had an operation to remove a lipoma (a tumour made of fatty tissue) in a Swiss clinic while visiting Mobutu last week. Kengo has reportedly resumed his normal activities and met with the deputy High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva on Saturday. Last week, Swiss television alleged that Mobutu had left Switzerland with 1.5 million Swiss francs (US$ 1.  2 million) in unpaid bills. The bills are said to relate to the rental of buildings, caterers, insurance companies and contractors working on the Mobutu's lakeside mansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Tanzania has earmarked 128 state owned firms for privitisation as part of its economic reforms. 31 of the firms will be sold by the end of September, increasing to 78 by the end of the year. Tanzania is also scheduled to open a stock exchange by the end of the month. Tanzania began embarking in privitisation in 1993 as part of western backed economic reforms, but critics say progress has been too slow and dogged by corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Petrol and diesel fuel prices in Tanzania were increased by up to 4.35% at the weekend. The Tanzanian Petroleum Development Corporation says that this increase reflects higher world oil prices. Premium petrol now costs 360 shillings (US$ O.58) a litre - up from 345 shillings. Diesel costs 285 shillings (US$0.46) up from 276 shillings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels are accused of holding more than 200 Ugandan youth hostage. The youngsters have been kidnapped from villages in the north of Uganda. The rebel's leader, Joseph Kony has been reported as saying that the LRA will abduct 10,000 Ugandans to Sudan for military training. Uganda's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs is reported to have left Uganda at the weekend for Khartoum, Sudan as part of ongoing attempts to normalise relationships between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># A leading African politician said on Friday that an African campaign to have the continent's massive external debts written off or at least reduced is gaining support from Western donors. Kwesi Botchway, the economic committee chairman of the Global Coalition for Africa said officials from creditor institutions who attended last week's GCA meeting supported the initiative to grant debt relief to the heavily indebted African countries.  Botchway, the former Ghanaian finance minister, said that the 33 least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa owed around US$ 164 billion out of Africa's total US$ 223 billion external debt for 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town -Statement by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairperson of the Truth And Reconciliation Commission issued August 30:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A delegation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will meet former police Commissioners tomorrow to discuss their co-operation with the Commission's investigations into human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Alex Boraine, the deputy chairperson, Mr Dumisa Ntsebeza, the head of our investigative unit and Mr Glen Goosen, the national investigations director, will join me at the meeting in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was arranged by telephone tonight with General J V van der Merwe, former Commissioner of Police, after he had proposed a meeting including himself, General H G de Witt, General M Geldenhuys and General P J Coetzee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The background to the meeting is as follows. Some weeks ago Dr Boraine announced that the Commission had instructed its Investigative Unit to be in a position to begin, on August 29, the process of serving subpoenas to individuals who may have information which would help the TRC carry out its mandate to establish the truth about human rights violations between 1960 and 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also some weeks ago, Dr Boraine and I urged the Minister of Safety and Security to prepare a submission to the Commission which could help us to fulfil our mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After press speculation this week on the identities of some of those who were about to receive subpoenas, the Ministry of Safety and Security, through Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, yesterday indicated to us that certain former police generals named as being on our list were helping the Ministry with its submission, and were willing to come forward voluntarily and work with the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We indicated to Deputy President Mbeki that if we were assured today by the generals concerned that they would work with the Commission, we would hold back on the issuing of subpoenas. General van der Merwe wrote to me proposing a meeting and, after discussions this evening, we agreed that it should be held this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission has repeatedly invited all those with information which may help it to establish the truth to come forward. We are prepared to issue subpoenas, under Section 29 of the act which established the Commission, in order to get information. However, if we receive the full co-operation of those who have the information we are seeking, we will not need to pursue that course.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The full text, issued August 30, of the decision and reasons of the Amnesty Committee in the matter of Boy Diale and Christopher Makgale follow:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boy Diale and Christopher Makgale were charged and convicted of the crime of the murder of Glad Mokgatle. The offence was committed on 29th December 1990 between Luka and Rooikraalspruit in the district of Bafokeng. They had both pleaded guilty to the charge. The trial court found that there were extenuating circumstances and on the 8th October 1991, they were sentenced to imprisonment of 12 years and 15 years respectively. They are at present serving their sentences at the Odi District Prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicants were among a group of ten people who went by Kombi to a house in Tshaneng to get the keys of the Bafokeng Civic Centre from Glad Mokgatle, who will hereinafter be referred to as the deceased. This was done in pursuance of a decision taken at a meeting of the Action Committee earlier that day. The original intention of the group was to take the keys of the Civic Centre from the deceased, kidnap him and hold him hostage for reasons which I shall mention later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the group arrived at the house in which the deceased was, they surrounded it. Some went into the house whilst others stayed outside. When they eventually encountered the deceased he came out of the house armed with a panga and appeared to be aggressive. The group overpowered him, put him in the Kombi and drove off. He was questioned about the keys to the Civic Centre, but proved to be unco-operative. Some members of the group assaulted the deceased and at a spot along the road the Kombi stopped, the deceased was pulled out and beaten up. The two applicants joined in the assault on the deceased and although initially they did not intend to kill him, emotions ran high and they were caught up in a frenzy of violence and although some members of the group did not want to kill the deceased the majority view was that he should be killed. When asked what the reason was for the decision to kill the deceased, Diale said &quot;the main reason, we did not want him to identify us&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assault on the deceased caused his death. When questioned about his precise participation in the assault on the deceased, Diale said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it is a request from the Committee I will have to state it clearly. I kicked him, I hit him with my fists and I strangled his neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the evidence of the second applicant, the deceased was being attacked after he was pulled out of the Kombi and lying on the ground. His evidence was:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a look at Mr Mokgatle and I could see that he was still alive. I took the sabre from him and I chopped him. I chopped him personally. I chopped him because I realised that we were heading for the prison. I wanted to sweep away the evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicants were members of the Action Committee of the Bafokeng Tribe.  There was overwhelming evidence that the killing of the deceased was due to the fact that he was chairman of the Tribal Council in the Bafokeng district.  He had been appointed to that position by Mr Lucas Mangope, President of Bophuthatswana. The people of Phokeng looked upon the deceased as a person who was put into position to administer the affairs of the Tribe on behalf of the regime which the Bafokeng people did not recognise and had over a long period of time, strenuously resisted. The Civic Centre belonged to the Tribe, but control thereof had been taken over by the Mangope regime. The social, political and cultural activities of the Tribe could not take place in the Civic Centre unless it was assented to by the deceased in his capacity as chairman of the Tribal Council. The Civic Centre represented the symbol of the people's aspirations and they believed that in order to regain control of it, they had to get hold of the keys from whoever was in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was overwhelming evidence of the rejection by the Bafokeng Tribe of the Mangope regime as the Tribe did not want to be incor- porated into the homeland of Bophuthatswana. The rightful chief of the Bafokeng people, namely Chief Molotlegi had been driven into exile in March 1988 and he was replaced by an appointee of Lucas Mangope. The tribe's desire to get their chief back to his rightful place as Chief of the Bafokeng was the earnest wish of both the applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The background and context within which the crime was committed was set out in their application for amnesty and a portion of it reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The applicant is a member of the Bafokeng tribe. The Bafokeng own most of the platinum reserves in South Africa. Approximately 300 000 members strong, it receives R75 000 000-00 per annum in royalties from Impala Platinum. Prior to the independence of Bophuthatswana, the royalties were kept in trust by the SA government, Department of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Bafokeng.  After independence, Mangope assumed trusteeship and the royalties were paid directly into the account of the Bophuthatswana Department of Finance. The contribution of the tribe to the economy of this &quot;state&quot; was enormous and in these circumstances the Bafokeng expected that the Bophuthatswana government would give them due recognition. Such recognition was not forthcoming and a steady deterioration of the relationship between Mangope and the Bafokeng started in 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 1983 the tribe attempted to secede and as a result, Mangope visited Phokeng on May 14 and told them:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I have come to tell you to go, you must trek - I say vacate ... I am going to conduct a Commission of Enquiry here. I want you to know that as from now we are going to declare a state of emergency in Phokeng.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the attempted coup in 1988, Chief Lebone Molotlegi of the Bafokeng, his wife and numerous members of the tribe were detained without trial; and without any charges being brought against them. When Chief Lebone was released, he left Bophuthatswana and went into exile in Gaberone. Before leaving, he appointed his Rangwane Mr Cecil Tumagole as leader of the tribe to act on his behalf in his absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During 1988, all meetings of the Bafokeng Tribal Authority, Tribal Council and the Bafokeng Women's Club were banned. Under these circumstances it became impossible for the tribe to administer its affairs - e.g. major construction contracts relating to ongoing work could not be complied with and new contracts could not be considered and/or approved. Furthermore, Mangope intervened in the tribe's affairs and general administration and literally forced the tribe to business with Impala Platinum. Impala Platinum refused to make available to the tribe certain information regarding their mining operations as allegedly they had been assured by Mangope that they would not have to disclose the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mangope, mindful of the tribe's opposition to him devised a strategy whereby persons sympathetic to him were appointed to positions of authority within the tribe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result, George Molotlegi was appointed as Acting Chief and Glad Mokgatle as Chairman of the Tribal Council. Others sympathetic to his government were also appointed and those who opposed the Acting Chief were dismissed. In this was a completely changed leadership was created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On 4 April 1990, members of the tribe wrote a letter to Mangope requesting an appointment to discuss the leadership of the Bafokeng. All the signatories were picked up at their homes and taken to Mmabatho as a form of intimidation.  Letters were also written to the former State President F W de Klerk and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha, but to no avail. Mangope refused to meet with members of the tribe unless the meeting was arranged by the Acting Chief. In spite of the fact that the Acting Chief was part of the problem, the members were so desperate at this stage that in June 1990, 25 of them wrote to him requesting a meeting. All twenty five (25) of the signatories (including the secretary who had typed the letter, who at the time was five months pregnant) were detained.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it might appear from the evidence that the applicants, more especially the second applicant, made sure that the deceased died of his injuries because they feared that had he lived, he would most certainly have implicated them in the assault on him, the evidence as a whole leaves no doubt that the attack on the deceased was associated with a political objective, that is regaining control of the Tribe. In this regard it should be noted that in sentencing the two applicants the Judge accepted the fact that their offence was politically motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicants and their companions believed that they were acting on behalf of the Bafokeng people in furtherance of their political struggle against an oppressive regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sons of the deceased were present and two of them gave evidence. They concede that the applicants had acted on behalf of the Bafokeng Tribe and expressed the wish that amnesty be granted to the applicants. They expressed the belief that reconciliation within the Tribe would be achieved if the applicants were released from prison and granted amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have come to the conclusion that their conduct meets the requirements of the criteria set out in Section 20 (3) of the Act. They are hereby granted amnesty in terms of the Act in respect of the murder of Mr Glad Mokgatle on the 29th December 1990 in the district of Bafokeng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decision and reasons signed by Mr Justice H Mall, Mr Justice A B M Wilson, Mr Justice B Ngoepe, Mr C de Jager and Ms S Khampepe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paarl - In a public meeting held in Mbekweni, Paarl, recently, TRC Committee member Ms. Pumla Gobodo-Madikezela found that a number of residents were concerned that if they gave statements to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, this would provoke threats from people who do not want the details of past conflict to be exposed. Ms. Gobodo- Madikezela wants to assure the Paarl community that the work of the Truth Commission is not about witch-hunting and pointing a finger at those who are seen as having inflamed the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, the objective of the Commission is to help resolve conflicts of the past, and to find explanation for them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, we wish to inform every one that the Truth Commission has a witness protection programme. If anyone feels that their safety will be compromised as a result of making a statement to the Commission, she/he has a right to apply for protection. We would hope that the people of Paarl will join together in reflecting on the struggle in Paarl, and in sharing their experiences of suffering on all sides of the conflict. More statement taking has been scheduled for Saturday 31st August.  This will take place at the Huguenot Community Hall and the Mbekweni Community Hall from 11a.m. until 5p.m. at both places.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Patrick Mubanga Kafuti, defence minister Ben Mwila's nephew, has repudiated the testimony he gave to the Commission of Inquiry into the accident and death of Baldwin Nkumbula last November, saying it was false and cooked up by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now Kafuti says Nkumbula was shot by State House security personnel, whom he can identify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti also reveals that President Frederick Chiluba begged him not to tell anyone the 'true' story about how Nkumbula was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he claims the President, who promised to take care of him in so many ways, has not honoured his words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And fearing for his life, and permanent insecurity, Kafuti says, he has now been compelled to let the world know the truth about Nkumbula's 'mysterious' death in a car crash in Kitwe on August 27, last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not just living like a . . . normal life the way I used to do. I am also living in fear. Maybe those same people would just do something that no one gets to know. So what I thought was, if I told someone who was responsible, who will know such things and who would know how to take care of such things. Like if ah . . . anything had to happen, they would like ah . . .  say something or do something to let the people know so that no one just dies a mysterious death just like that,&quot; Kafuti reveals in his Jamaican-like English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below is a verbatim transcript of an interview with Patrick Kafuti:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My name is Mubanga Patrick Kafuti and the date today is 29th, at 12:15 hours. And I am hereby saying this because of my own will and I want to leave this just in case something happened to me just that people can know exactly what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What's the date today?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: It's 29th February, 1996. This is relating to Baldwin Nkumbula's accident which happened last year in August...27th. We were in Lusaka, let me just start from the beginning, we were in Lusaka, it was a Friday when we left Lusaka in the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: With who?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: We were me, Castro, Micko, Mwaba and Benjamin. For me it was, and for the rest, well what I knew it was for the intention of going for a funeral in Kitwe which happened to our, let me say, because, Benjamin my older cousin, that is Benjamin Mwila's first son, his wife's elder sister's husband died so that is why we had to travel to Kitwe for the funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What vehicle were you using?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: We were using a GX.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: From?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: From State House it is ACD 926, I can't remember very well now. So when we left, we were meant to leave in the morning, but I don't know what happened. So we left about late in the evening about 17:00 hours. We travelled alright until we got there. We just passed through Ndola and that is why we got there in the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Where did you go in Ndola?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: When we got to Ndola we first went to the guest house because Miko's elder sister Helen was there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: The Presidential guest house?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes (the one) in Kabelenga Avenue. So we passed there. We were meant to sleep and then the guy said no, since we are going for the funeral we have to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Do you remember anybody you could relate to who you had seen in Ndola on that day, before you proceeded?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: No, we never saw anyone. We just went straight to the guest house and then from the guest house, we said no, because Helen were having a drink up at Aunt Sara's, Vera's young sister, late young sister. We passed through there, we just passed spent about fifteen minutes and then with all the guys we decided to proceed to Kitwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we proceeded to Kitwe, we first went straight to the guest house where we were meant to sleep but we actually didn't sleep there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Which guest house?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: The . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Kafue river?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: No, not the Kafue river one . . .. in town...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Mine . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Jacaranda guest house</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: In Kitwe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: In Kitwe yes. So we went to sleep there early in the morning about 04 O'clock since the guys wanted to go first to a party, the disco and all, so in the morning we had to go to the funeral since the burial was on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Where was the funeral?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: The funeral was in Ndeke village. So when we went for the burial we went for burial and everything was finished we went back to the funeral house, I mean after a burial everyone goes to the funeral house. So when we went to the funeral house we just stayed there about two hours then we went to the guest house we had a bath, we went in town, we had our hair cuts then we went back to the guest house. We stayed up to about late in the night. And when we were leaving, we were meant to leave to come to Ndola because Helen wanted us to come to Ndola. We didn't come to Ndola because the guys wanted to stay in Kitwe. So we stayed in Kitwe the whole day. It was late at night when Castro came up to me and said let's go and see Baldwin (Nkumbula). I asked him to say why he wanted to see Baldwin at that time because we had been in Kitwe the whole day and for someone to . . .if he wanted to someone, we were going to do it in the afternoon because we were not doing anything in the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What time was this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: It was about 23 somewhere around 23:00 hours. So for me I refused to go to someone's house at . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: That hour?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: At that hour, because it was late and why? Probably he was going to be sleeping by the way. But Castro insisted to meet Baldwin until I totally refused. And when I refused he said okay fine, I'll go alone and you guys since you want to go in town I'll find you in town. So we all, that's all the guys as we came from Lusaka jumped into the car the GX and he dropped us in town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Who was driving the car?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: It was a driver, I can't remember his name . . . eh . . . eh . . .  I remember the bodyguard. The bodyguards name is Mr.Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: But you don't remember the driver's name?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: The driver no but he is there (indicates the head) it's just that I can't remember him now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So all along the dirver was driving?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes he was the one who was driving. He dropped us. I mean Castro and the driver dropped us in town and the body guard remained at home. He said no since the car was full they had to drop us and then on their way to go and see Baldwin they were going to pick up the body guard. When they went, I mean they dropped us off so I didn't know what was happening there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So where did they drop you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: They dropped us at Cinderella.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: That's a night club?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What time was that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Now it was about, going to somewhere about mid night. So if I can just go back a bit. For what I remember when Castro was saying let's go to Baldwin's house, he said something I didn't realise, even, that's why I even turned down going to Baldwin's house, he said let's go to Baldwin's house and I know why I want to go to Baldwin's house. You just have to be there and when everything is done that's when we come back and join the rest of the guys in town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q:That's what Castro was telling you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: You didn't ask him what he was going to do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: What he wanted to go and do there? Why are you involved...what he said was like when everything is done, so I completed like saying there is nothing good that's going to be done or said such that after that we come and join the rest of the guys. Because if there was anything nice he was definitely going to tell me. And ah . . ., after he went...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: And left you at Cinderella?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes, after he went he got there and found Baldwin and some other people, like they were having a drink just chatting. He used a false name to get inside. He said he was Danny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Danny who?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Danny Nkumbula the young brother to Baldwin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Who told you that he used a false name?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: He said he was going to do that if the guard didn't allow him to go in the house and that is what he liked doing every time he went there, so he used that name and when Baldwin came out he said &quot;oh yeah it is Castro, so he then went in the house. So when Castro went in, he stayed there for some time I think until they came into town. He told Baldwin to say he wanted to go to the funeral house and I don't understand why he wanted to go there at that time such that we had been there and we had finished everything and we were meant to come back to Lusaka the next morning on Sunday. And according to Baldwin he didn't refuse and knowing Castro he has been there all the time and there was no way he was going to refuse and that's why I think everything had to happen through Castro because they knew that he won't refuse to Castro about anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q:So when they came back they found you at Cinderella?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: When they came back they found me at Cinderella and they called me down stairs and Baldwin said: &quot;hi how are you, why did you not come to the house?&quot; And I said sorry; I used to call him uncle myself, I said sorry uncle I thought it was late and there was no way we were going to come at that time because we had been here the whole day and Castro didn't think of coming to the house during the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he said Castro wants to go to . . ..I don't know what he wants to go and do at the funeral house. He says he can't remember exactly it is you who can remember exactly where the place is. I said yes I can remember exactly where the funeral house is but I mean to go there at this time....and I asked Castro what he wanted to go and do there and he said I know what I want to go and do there. And just when we were standing there when I looked across the road where we were parked there was a BMW, there was a blue BMW with three people inside...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Registration number..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I can't...I didn't read it ...but I know the BMW and I have seen it at State House and the people there they looked familiar and even if I had to see them now I would definitely point them out that these are the people who were in the car and when I looked at them they were like, you know . . . they got so guilty that I was looking at them. And I knew them and they were definitely maybe suspecting that I was going to walk across to go and say hi to them and ask them what they were doing there since we were all in Kitwe.  If they were supposed to guard us they were supposed to come to the guest house to stay with us were we were staying and they didn't do that. So I said okay fine let me take you. When we got in the car, Baldwin started driving and after some meters that's when this other car also started coming-the BMW.  We passed the first traffic lights they were green</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Which traffic lights?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: The Edinburgh traffic lights. They were green, so we passed them.  When we stopped at the second traffic lights near . . . as you go towards Jacaranda road there are traffic lights there just before that main road. So when we stopped they stopped about ah...I can say about ah..almost ah...  about ah...50 to 60 meters away from where we had stopped. I mean every car which is coming from behind if you stopped at traffic lights it is supposed to come near you, close to you, next you to you. They did not do that and Baldwin became suspicious and said why is that car stopping at a far position from where we stopped at the traffic lights. And I said I don't know maybe they are just talking since it was in the night. So we started driving, they started following as well from a distance. When we turned into the main road they also turned. We passed those traffic lights by Mukuba House that new Mukuba House they were green and they were just following us as well and Baldwin increased the speed, from there. That's when he started increasing the speed he said no, he wanted to check if they are following us or not.  When he increased the speed that's when they increased the speed as well. He got suspicious and ah..he was scared and said in the night why are they following us? When I increase the speed and they also increase the speed.  When we approached towards the traffic lights those central traffic lights they were red but he didn't want to stop to see if they were going to stop.  So when he passed they also passed so that's when he increased the speed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Now you were entering?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: The dual carriage way. So when we entered the dual carriage way he increased the speed they also increased the speed. You know that former like..  .Starlight night club? We passed it and that's when they came fast and he went fast as well. So we were going towards that ah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Underbridge?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti:...flyover bridge which is at Wusakile that's when I heard something like a bang and he (Baldwin) said that sounds like a gun, are those people shooting at us or not?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Who said?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: That's Baldwin and what I said, I said they are definitely shooting at us because they can't be chasing us all the way from town. And just when we passed the . . . we were not very fast but we were going pretty fast since he was running away from those guys. So when we passed the flyover bridge that's when I heard the second shot and that's when I saw him like go in front like he was trapped over something. He just went in front and I saw the car had just lost control. And when I called out: Baldwin are you alright? He didn't answer me. Baldwin are you alright? He didn't answer me and it's when I told Castro that we are going to flip, we are losing control and that car behind was just there, still coming. So we lost control and begun flipping.  And when we came to a stand still like everything was done so it was just quiet there was nothing. So I heard that car stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Where in front or behind?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: No we were on the opposite side. We were like on this other road which going to Ndola so I heard this car stop on the other road because myself I was still alright. So what I did was, I remained there as if I was just out of my mind. Like I didn't know what was happening. They came out I believe and I understand...I am pretty sure I heard two voices saying just check and see if eh..if he is dead and the other boy said he's dead. He's dead alright and these other boys they are just like, they don't seem to be dead but I think they can't remember anything. They don't know anything. I pretended like I was not hearing. And he said he's dead alright. He dead he's a right off. So let's just go. We've done our thing so we have to go back to Lusaka. Even now let's just start off now for Lusaka. That's how I heard the car went...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Were they using English or?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: They were using partly English and Nyanja. It was just mixed. So that's when I got up and even saw the BMW just going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: You couldn't get the number?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: No, I was bleeding as well and I was just trying to see myself if I was alright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: If you can recall, the few moments from the first shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q:What did Castro say. Did you ask Castro anything apart from what you have said?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Castro wasn't say anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q:He was quiet?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Up to the time you were flipping?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes he was still quiet. Even when Baldwin said that sounds like a gun, like a shot, are they shooting at us or not, Castro wasn't answering I am the one who answer. But for me it looked like he was talking to Castro since they were in front together and I answered from behind after some time I said definitely it seems like they are shooting at us. It looks like it is coming towards us like they are coming to attack us or something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Did Castro meet these people during the day?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Well he went out during the day alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: You don't know where he went?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I don't know where he went.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Why were you kept at a secret place after your discharge (from hospital)?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: After the discharge, I was kept at Jacaranda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: In Kitwe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: In Kitwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Under guard?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Under guard. There was no one who was allowed to see me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Why. And who did that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Why? I don't know where the instructions came from but we were just told that we've been instructed no one is supposed to see you. No newspapers no journalist not anybody is supposed to see you apart from these guys who are here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: For how long were you at Jacaranda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I was there for a week and a half or two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: In Kitwe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: In Kitwe yes, then I came here at Kabelenga. I spent some time at Kebelenga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How many . . . how many . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I think a week. And I went to Lusaka and I stayed at State House for I think a week then I went and persuaded them that I wanted to go and stay with my sister where I usually stay, in Long Acres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: After you had flipped what can you recall after those people had gone now, what happened?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I remember, after we flipped, when I came out Castro wasn't there at the seat. I looked for him and he wasn't there around the car. So I concentrated on Baldwin, I wanted to see how he was since I had seen him been struck before we flipped. And I went round I saw him like his head was totally smashed on the face and I couldn't even recall his face properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Since your release have youn been contacted by anybody in Zambia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes, I have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Who?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: They don't tell me their names they just pick me up. They park the car. They took me last time. Like last time they came, they didn't tell me who sent them like to pick me up. They just said they came to pick me up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: From where?</SPAN></P>

That's where they took me. There is that room which has some windows like this but it is just dark you can't see outside and it's dark in the room inside but there is a light. And when they took me inside that room there was a light so, I sat there and they said no, we are coming and they went out. And it's like, it's is a very hard door which is on there and they switched off the light and it was very dark and I couldn't like see anything? I was kept there for about an hour or so. And then I just heard like voices asking me where I am and such things like that and if I remember anything from the accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: And what did you say?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I didn't say anything. I didn't ask them . . .they asked but I didn't answer them. And after I came out I was like sort of ....like ah...  disturbed something like that because I had been kept in the darkness for too long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Then, after that what happened?</SPAN></P>

Definitely I remember everything and what happened at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he said everything would be taken care of. That was like around September . . .end of September. That was end of September it was a week before end of September he said I will have someone to take you down to South Africa to see a health Inspector and I don't want you to tell anyone about what happened that day what you saw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: That's what he said?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: That's what he said. I don't want you...I beg of you not to tell anyone or anybody of what happened, what you know or what you saw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: That's what he said?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: That's what he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Himself?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Himself I was speaking to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q:In Nkwazi house?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: I see. Now how was your statement on T.V...what happened did you tell him that you were being taken to the T.V studio?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I was . . . first of all I was eh . . . I was approached by these people who came to say they wanted me to come and testify from Kitwe about the accident. They said before I go I am supposed to go to force headquarters at the police headquarters in Lusaka, the one which is opposite finance...  Ministry of Finance. So when I went there these other two officers they just took me in an office and they said that we know exactly what happened that day and what we want you to say is that....we don't want you to say what happened that day. And they gave me a paper and I went through that...eh...  It was just unfortunate I didn't make a copy of that paper . . .of what was written. That's why I said on T.V that...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Who wrote that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I don't know who wrote that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: But they gave it to you to read?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Who are these people at force headquarters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Ah...If I check . . . I think I've got it in my old note book. Not the one I've got here. I think it is in Lusaka, the '95 one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: You can't remember them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: No I can't you know these Eastern Province names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So they are the ones who coached you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes, they told me that all I am going to say is ah. . . what happened is that: I was not going to say there was a car coming from behind...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: They told you that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes. I was not going to say I heard shots, and there was nothing like coming in front or forward. I was going to say yeah he was ....okay he didn't appear drunk to me, but I was going to say he was drinking or something like that. Like he kind of looked drunk to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Let's get backwards. When you were picked to go to force headquaters, who picked you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: It was ah...no they just brought..They didn't pick me. When they came to look for me I wasn't there so they said no . . . they just left a note to say no, come to force headquarters and come upstairs in room 112 or 115 . . . I don't know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: You can't remember?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I can't remember it was the second floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Second floor 112 or 115?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes I think it is the intelligence department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So when you went there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: When I went there that is when I was taken to the room just in the office there. Just in their office. They locked the door and there no one who could come in that is when they gave me the piece of paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Okay. Let's get back again. Why has it taken you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">so long to say this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Why it has taken so long for me to say this? Okay fine, they said they would see to it that my . . . I am like ah...they were saying every time I'd be protected but I am not protected you see. Fine. They were saying they will take care of my health, they'd see to it that I am alright and everything my injuries are okay but they haven't done that. And like what I said I don't want . . . I am not just living like a normal life the way I used to do. I am also living in fear. Maybe those same people would just, like maybe, do something just that they make sure that no one gets to know.  So what I thought was, if I told someone who was responsible, who will know such things and who would know how to take care of such things. Like if anything had to happen, they would like say something or do something to let the people know so that no one just dies a mysterious death just like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So your family does not know?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: My family does not know, I haven't told anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Your father, your mother . . . ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: No my father died in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What type of relationship have you got with Ben Mwila?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: He is, Ben Mwila is my uncle he my dad's young brother. And from what I see I think ah . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What has he said?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: He hasn't said anything to me. I've been there to the house though I was there once, and he was just in the house when I came he was in the bedroom he didn't come out. Twice . . . the other time I went there he wasn't there, there was just my aunt and just some other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So what do you . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti (Cutting in): So what I know . . . if it was someone like who didn't know anything like I was just involved in an accident and he wanted to help me, he was going to come forward, you see. He's got money and he was going to come forward and say no, he's my nephew and I'll see to it that he is alright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I don't see why everything is just being like . . . (silence).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So he's not helping you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: No, not at all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What about the president what did he promise you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: He promised me that everything would be taken of. Such that I get to stay alright, I have security, and I am taken to South Africa for my medical checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So were you taken to South Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: No, I wasn't taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So what is wrong with you now medically?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Medically, what I feel is like.. even what I was told the doctor sometime from (University Teaching Hospital) UTH is that this..it's my pelvis.  First when I was just involved in the accident my pelvis was swollen, like I wasn't able to move this leg and when I started moving this leg it was becoming small and they said it was my ligaments,....there was something wrong with my ligaments. It's like it's even moved inside such that..because it is even shorter than the other if I had to stand up somebody would say there is something wrong with you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Have been there since?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes I have been there, to State House several times to say or ask him or rather to remind him to say why did you say this? I am still waiting and he keeps saying he will get back to me. And when I sometimes go there to see him I don't know if it is his directives to them (State House security) to tell me that I cannot see him from the gate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So you don't go there anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I don't go there, because I just got fed up, you know it was so frustrating..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Can you talk about Castro?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Castro is much better and its not like ah . . . I am not so much like ah . . . really allowed to come into contact with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Have you spoken to him since the accident?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes I have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What is his position?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: His position is that he is not very . . . alright and he remembers very little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: He remembers very little?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What does he remember?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: He remembers of . . . like he was just laker and doesn't really know what happened before. I don't know exactly because I haven't really spoken to him where we have to sit down and really...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Where do you think he is right now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: He is South Africa . . . right now he has gone back to South Africa.  He was at State House but he has gone back to South Africa for some review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Do you remember when the last time you went to State House was?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: The last time I went to State House was...that time the national (soccer) team came back from South Africa. That's when I went to State House I wanted to speak to him, that was even before the football team got there, I wanted to speak to the president and he told me that I couldn't see him. I said okay fine, If I can't see him can I be allowed to . . . can you ask him maybe if I can be allowed just to see my friend and he said it was not possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: As of now do you think your life is in danger?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: What I think is . . . I don't just think like I am going to live just a normal life after that accident. For I know something was behind that accident I don't think I'll ever just live a normal life. Okay I can live just nicely like this but one day definitely maybe, something will happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Are you convinced that Baldwin Nkumbula was murdered?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Pretty sure, because if he wasn't meant to be murdered that car wasn't going to be following us, they were not going to be shooting at us.  What I think is that it was made to just look like an accident while I know something else happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: If we asked you to go to Lusaka, can you identify the car which was following you and also identify the names of the officials whom you saw because you have said you can recognise them if you had to see them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: If I had to see them, If they have to come I can recognise them and if I have to see the car, even if it passed in the street and we happened to be driving in the street I can recognise it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What kind of vehicle was it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: From?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: The same vehicle which was following you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: It was a BMW. A 5 series BMW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: The one used by police?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: At State House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes. That same colour and it has no semi corvers. They don't really like have corvers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Lastly what do you wish to put to the Zambia people which you want them to know regarding this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I would wish that the Zambians had to know the truth from the beginning just when they took me for that same (Commission of) Inquiry. That is where I was meant to say the truth such that everyone was going to be satisfied from that same statement I gave. But even if anybody will say they were satisfied I am not satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So what you say now is what you wanted the Zambia people to know?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Exactly, exactly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: In short you did not tell the truth during the inquiry because you were promised some things?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Not even that because I was told that I had to read. I had no choice. I had to read. I had to say what was written there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Which was made from force headquarters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Were promised anything and by who?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: The President..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Who?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Mr. Frederick Chiluba, the President himself promised he was going to take care of my medicals, he was going to take care of my school fees if I got better because I was meant to go to college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Which college?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I was meant to go to any college in Lusaka for computer training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So medicals, school fees, what else?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: And he said later on we can like as we go on we can like when I ask for anything that's when he just gives me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: This was a promise after the accident?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: For you not to say anything?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes. Most probably yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How did this offer come up. Did you ask for it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: No, he just..when I went there he just found me in the living room and he spoke to me. He told me not to worry about anything because he was going to take care of my medicals, transport and everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How do you feel now if...or suppose there was a way ..you were outside and there was an impartial tribunal would you be able to face President Chiluba and tell him what you are just saying here, have you got that courage?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I've got that courage. Even now if it means going there in person and just telling him the truth, I'd do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Can you write him a letter to remind him of his promises and so you can have a record because you see it is your word versus the President of the republic and you can see the difficulties you are going through. Can you even remember the dates you saw him or he would claim he has never even seen you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: Yes I can but I can't remember the exact dates. Let me just say it was.. I think it was the week before the end of September. Not exactly but the week before end of September. I was going to be exact if I was writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So you are saying because you feel...?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I feel somebody has to know. Someone responsible has to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: You have not said this to anyone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I can swear here I haven't said this to anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: There was a newspaper story that you had said that we were going to crash, the car is going too fast and you had pulled down Castro's seat?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: It was written in the paper but I never said anything. I never spoke to any news reporter any journalist , any ZNBC (Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation) people. I never spoke to anyone but I don't know why that happened to be like I was the one who said it, because I don't know why it was in the paper and I was not allowed to say anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So you did not say those things?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I never said and I want to know who directed those words to be writtenn in that paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: So you never said those words?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafuti: I never said that.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Though the date for the bidding of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) properties has been set for February 28, reports continue filtering through that the chairman of Anglo American Corporation, Julian Thomson, does not agree with the recommendations of the Rothschild Report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report on the privatisation of ZCCM recommends that the conglomerate be unbundled into four units, three mining units, and another unit comprising utilities, including electricity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources from the company's London offices, Anglo is of the view that such a structure would lead to a possibility of the mining units having to buy electricity too expensively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result has been a protracted round of negotiations between the Zambian government and the largest of its B shareholders in ZCCM - Anglo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government sources, however, say Zambia will follow the way given by the Rothschild Report as it shows the best way out of ZCCM's present dilemma of crippling debt burden and inadequate resources.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - Striking Zimbabwean civil servants grudgingly returned to work on Wednesday, but union leaders warned the strike will resume unless government opens negotiations on outstanding grievances by Sept. 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of government workers assembled at Harare's Africa Unity square to be briefed by members of the unified civil service negotiating committee on the outcome of Tuesday's marathon talks with public service, labor and social welfare minister, Florence Chitauro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar briefings were held in various centers throughout the country, with large turnouts reported in Bulawayo, Mutare and Gweru.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitauro told a news conference on Tuesday that cabinet had rescinded an order dismissing the workers who staged the 16-day strike that crippled essential government services. She also threatened to dismiss all workers who would not have returned to work by Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government last week conceded it had erred by awarding the majority of the 161,000 civil servants less than 10 percent in salary increases and agreed to add another 20 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the civil servants were not happy with the government decision to withhold pay for the period they had been on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a committee we are extremely disappointed. We are saying how can they take money from us when they know that we are already poorly paid,&quot; said Farai Jiya, a member of the negotiating committee, when addressing the workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the committee was also disappointed cabinet had not seen the urgency of the need to address workers grievances outlined in a seven-point document submitted to Chitauro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven demands included increases in various allowances, a unified labor law encompassing all workers, including civil servants, and a 40-hour working week with anything beyond that being treated as overtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Jiya said the committee felt it was prudent to stage a strategic retreat by going back to work and then come back in full force along with the teachers after schools have opened, should government fail to open negotiations on outstanding issues. Schools open on Sept. 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The seven demands put us on the streets. It is the seven demands that will get us back on the streets. We are giving them until 27 September to start negotiations on those demands. On that day we will report back to you,&quot; Jiya told the workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, as the meeting broke up in disorder with the majority of workers apparently disappointed, the leaders continued to exhort the workers to return to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some in the crowd shouted that the strike should continue until all demands are met by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others said the strike had been a failure as it had resulted in them losing half their salaries for the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts have put the cost of the strike at over Zimdollars 1 billion (100 million U.S. dollars) in uncollected government revenue, while hundreds of people could have died due to lack of care in government hospitals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana - The second phase of Accra's Kotoka International Airport rehabilitation and development project will begin this year, the country's Transport and Communications minister, Edward Selia, said here Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the commissioning of the airport's passenger transit lounge, closed circuit television equipment and two fire tenders, Selia said the project would start with the reconstruction and refurbishing of facilities within and outside the terminal building at the cost of about 65 million U.S.  dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the project will involve the doubling of floor space in the arrival and departure areas, and installation of new and long baggage conveyer belts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expansion will provide decent accommodation or holding area to minimize human congestion in front of the passenger terminal building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dedicated cargo aircraft apron in front of the cargo warehouse to take about four wide-bodied aircraft will also be constructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said the capacity of the cargo warehouse will be increased by 50 percent and feasibility studies will be conducted to extend the runway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the rehabilitation project, there will be duty free shops and an &quot; airport city&quot; complex will be developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said there are more projects in the pipeline to make Ghanaian airports reflect &quot;the new image of Ghana as the peaceful and investment haven.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phase one of Kotoka International Airport's development project was completed three years ago with financial assistance from the Overseas Development Administration of United Kingdom and support from the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that phase, the major project component included the resurfacing of the runway, provision of visual aids, remodeling and expansion of the arrival and departure halls, refurbishment of the control tower and the construction of a dedicated freight terminal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines limited (ZCCM) has reported an operating profit of k59,972 million (1,200 = 1 U.S. dollar) in the first quarter that ended June 30 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ZCCM report published in Lusaka Wednesday said the profit was higher than the k57,623 million recorded during the corresponding quarter of 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document said the company made a net profit of k14,676 million compared with k12,051 million in the same period of 1995 after taking into account exchange losses, interest, taxation charges and other factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The average sales realization for copper at k2.715 million per ton for the quarter, was 19 percent higher than the k2.275 million per ton realized in the corresponding quarter of 1995.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been attributed to the depreciation of the kwacha since the average copper price achieved for the quarter was US $ 2,226 per ton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, the market experienced a significant drop in London metal exchange prices during the quarter from 2,841 dollars per ton on May 9 this year to 1,830 dollars per ton on June 27 and remains uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, cobalt sales increased to k59.546 million per ton for the quarter that ended June 30 compared to k49.745 million per ton realized in the similar quarter of the 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revenue from the sales of precious metals amounted to k300 million during the quarter compared to sales of k819 million during the corresponding period of the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian government has appointed consultants to come up with recommendations on how best to privatize the ZCCM under its ongoing economic liberalization programme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - British Airways, after admitting as &quot;unacceptable&quot; its treatment of London-bound passengers from Lusaka, has, instead of giving meaningful compensation, offered them &quot;a free ticket to a destination of their choice anywhere in our network in the world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;free&quot; tickets are not redeemable for cash, as is usually the case in such offers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more than 200 passengers were delayed for 24 hours at Lusaka International airport on Saturday. They spent Saturday night in the plane as it could not take off because it developed a fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrangements to take them to hotels to eat were only made after mid-day Sunday. Irate passengers could not understand why British Airways did not book them in a hotel as per aviation regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the passengers accused the airline of racist treatment because the extended delay happened on an African route. But the British Airways officials denied this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, an official of the airline regretted what he referred to as &quot;this series of events which were recognized as unacceptable for an airline which prides itself on providing the highest levels of customer service.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To compensate the passengers for being virtual prisoners in the plane for 24 hours, he offered &quot;every passenger on board a free ticket to a destination of their (sic) choice anywhere on our network in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passengers, who left Lusaka for London 9.00 p.m. (19:00GMT) on Sunday after the 24-hour delay, were met on arrival at Gatwick Airport by British Airway's head of customer relations, Richard Hill, and other members of staff who offered assistance and apologies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya - Visiting Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has urged support to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also called for the restructuring of the United Nations into a &quot;neutral and democratic&quot; organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The important responsibility of our two countries makes it necessary to put further emphasis on the survival of NAM, the democratic restructuring of the UN and presenting a logical and neutral interpretation of the relation between human rights and culture, religion and social traditions of developing countries,&quot; Rafsanjani said at a state dinner in Nairobi on Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that many developing countries were not satisfied with the &quot; discriminatory treatment and double standards&quot; of some industrialized countries particularly in areas of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rich countries, he added, were using the United Nations as an instrument with which to pursue their own political objectives in the non- aligned and poor nations by exerting undue pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at another function, Rafsanjani, who toured the Kenyan Petroleum Refineries and the port of Mombasa, said his government was developing a friendly policy toward Africa, and will boost its investments in the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his government was determined to penetrate the African continent to stop its exploitation by the &quot;covetous West&quot;, adding that his current trip to east and southern Africa was just the beginning of the new thrust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rafsanjani promised increased trade ties and exchange of information with Iran's new African partners, whom he said had suffered since colonialism from unfair relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran has made tremendous strides in all forms of academic and industrial research and is willing to share her experiences with Africa in the brotherly spirit of Islam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's president, Daniel Arap-Moi, urged greater cooperation between Iran and his country, saying Iran could benefit from Kenya's tourism and agro- based industries, while Kenya had a lot to gain from the latter's energy and transport sectors. &quot;The push for such ties is more evident now in the face of current trends that seem to slow down the efforts of developing countries toward faster and sustained economic development,&quot; Moi said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria - The OAU Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim, has urged developing nations to accord the information and communication sector priority in their national development plans, if they are to achieve the desired breakthrough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless we keep our populations informed and fully involved, we would be far from realizing the desired objectives we seek to sustain,&quot; he said in a message to the ongoing conference of information ministers of the non-aligned countries in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identifying the information sector as &quot;very crucial to development,&quot; Salim urged the conference to &quot;address in all frankness, the problems and envisaged bottlenecks and to draw realistic and implementable plans.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim noted that &quot;the world of communication has become another super-power.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The developing countries, he added, should act swiftly together in response to the rapidly changing information technologies or &quot;we shall be left behind in the cold gaping at the spinning space revolution brought about by the new information super-highway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Salim named such challenges as &quot;cultural invasion, legislation affecting the mass media, the right to know and access to information, media for democracy programme, media in conflict resolution, freedom of speech and how to nurture it, and the mass media, as a partner in nation-building.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To achieve a desirable new world information order, he advocated effective south-south cooperation, regional initiatives and the pooling of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he lamented the plight of inter-governmental media agencies, such as the Dakar-based Pan African News Agency, which he said, were usually starved of funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lesson to draw from this is that poorly funded intergovernmental news agencies should perhaps be better managed by the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PANA, the continental wire service set up by the OAU in 1979, is undergoing financial crisis, due to non-payment of assessed contributions by many member- countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff of the agency have not received salary for several months now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - Delta Gold NL, the Australian partner in Zimbabwe's largest mining venture, has said it is pursuing other mineral exploration activities in the southern African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report, Delta Gold said over 6.7 million zimdollars (670,000 U.S.  dollars) would be spent on evaluation of new platinum deposits in the Mhondoro area, while metallurgical work on another platinum venture was in progress.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delta Gold said a geotechnical assessment of the areas selected for mining studies in the Ngezi Platinum area had already begun to determine the mineable areas and suitable mining methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Metallurgical test work is in progress. Preliminary studies on hydrology, socio-economics and power supply have commenced,&quot; said the company Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other exploration was being carried out in the Kwekwe mining area, as well as north-east of Bulawayo, where Delta said several geophysical diamond targets had been identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delta's Zimbabwe subsidiary, Masasa Mines, had also identified gold sites in Shamva and had taken a six-month option in the liquidated Kamativi tin mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has 33 percent share in the 260-million-U.S-dollar Hartley Platinum Venture, near Harare, currently Zimbabwe's single largest mining venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delta Gold, together with another Australian conglomerate, BHP Minerals, hope to start commercial platinum production early 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said total expenditure at Hartley Platinum as of June 30, 1996, was 200 million U.S. dollars and more than 229 million dollars had been committed as of that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Final capital cost remains in line with the forecast of 2.64 billion Zimdollars (264 million dollars),&quot; said the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other projects at Hartley, Delta said final purchases were being made on items required for the base metal refinery and technicians were focussing on the refinery and deploying more resources to speed-up construction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Should lay people be empowered to make greater contribution to the Christian ministry? If yes, how can the church achieve this goal? These are some of the concerns that confront the church in Africa today as it grows in numbers and is besieged by the countless challenges facing the continent's ordinary people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Ugandan church minister, the church in Africa can hardly ignore any discussion on the laity given that the latter comprise 90 per cent of the entire faithful in any given church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since &quot;the laity accounts for the larger part of the church, with the clergy representing a minority, there is need to empower the former for greater and wider pastoral contribution,&quot; says the Ugandan clergy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Uganda Anglican church minister is the Executive Secretary of the pan- African Association of Christian Lay Centres in Africa (ACLCA), which marks its silver jubilee in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare from October 6 to 13 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founded in 1970, the ACLCA currently brings together 63 lay centres in 24 African countries. The centres seek to share ideas and adopt common strategies for action to fulfil together their common vision to the glory of one Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The silver jubilee will help to prepare the centres for the year 2000 in the spirit of worship, binding together spiritually and the commitment to restoring right and just relationships in the human community,&quot; Rev.  Katoneene told APS. The occasion, he says, will be a commitment to the keep the spirit of ACLCA for the next 25 years towards the golden jubilee and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Katoneene says the silver jubilee celebrations will be based on the biblical concept of jubilee, especially in the Book of Leviticus 25, which emphasises restoration, not just merry making. He sees the forthcoming celebrations as an opportunity to strike a balance between joy and a critical reflection on the life, mission, work and witness of the ACLCA, particularly as the 21st century approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Kotoneene also sees in the silver jubilee an occasion to raise issues of justice, peace and reconciliation. It will also be a continuing process of redefining the vision of the African Christian centres in a continent full of oppression, conflict, hunger, illiteracy and deprivation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A brochure announcing the ACLCA October assembly talks of major workshops including one for youth and women. The fora will reflect on the political, social cultural and economic implications of human rights, church as a healing ministry to the vulnerable, ethnicity, gospel and culture, HIV-AIDS, environmental abuse and homelessness among other concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Rev. Katoneene, more than 100 persons are scheduled to attend the silver jubilee celebrations. These will include official delegates from ACLCA members, fraternal delegates from partner organizations such as the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Africa regional office of the World Students Christian Federation (WSCF) and the Africa office of the Young Men's/Women's Christian Association (YMCA/YWCA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ugandan clergy says the ACLCA celebrations will be a time to look at the strength, successes and weaknesses of the association under the common mission of leadership training, laity formation, and ecumenical learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Katoneene describes the main objective of the ACLCA as the promotion of contacts and the development of a common purpose between lay training centres in Africa, encouraging common planning and deepening the church's responsibility in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pan-African religious body also aims to strengthen the centres' programmes through closer fellowship, sharing of experiences, exchange of staff and/or students. It also encourages and co- ordinates research and study of common tasks, arranges joint training for staff and leaders in an effort to develop present and future ecumenical leaders and fosters dialogue between people of different faiths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLCA also produces materials and information related to lay training, offers advisory services in establishing and developing lay training activities in Africa, strengthens links with similar associations in other continents and works in close consultation with national Christian councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told APS that one of the challenges facing ACLCA is the strengthening of the ecumenical spirit among the lay centres. &quot;Currently we have only two Catholic centres as full members of the association. We would like to see more joining us for the common goal of empowering the role of the laity in Christian development,&quot; stressed the association's Executive Secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On ACLCA's experiences in the last 25 years of existence, Rev. Katoneene said the lay centres' movement has trained more clergy than laity. &quot;This trend will need to be reversed and we take it as one of the major challenges ahead of us,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, the father-in-charge of Kenya's metropolitan parish of the Holy Family Basilica, Nairobi, Fr. Anthony D'Souza, said highlighting concerns about the place of the laity in the church should not be misconstrued as some form of revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that some of the lay people today carry out roles that they did not perform in the past, does not simply mean there is some kind of revolution doing rounds in the church. I would like to see the move as a spiritual development in God's kingdom,&quot; he told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the programme approved in 1992 by the head of the Nairobi Catholic Archdiocese Maurice Cardinal Otunga, the parish has already admitted four lay people to distribute the Holy Eucharist during mass at the Holy Family Basilica church. Fr. D'Souza describes the inclusion of the lay as a recognition of &quot;talents within the vineyard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Njeru Wambugu of Kenya's Independent Church of Africa, one of the independent churches in the country, commenting on empowering the lay people for greater contribution to the Christian ministry, says the mainstream churches are now recognizing the crucial role lay people play in ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adds Bishop Wambugu who is also the General Secretary of the Organization for African Instituted Churches (OAIC); &quot;There is some push coming from the lay people in most of these churches, challenging the churches to admit them in their decision and policy making spheres.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Zairean church minister, Ngoy Mulunda-Nyanga, who is also the Executive Secretary for the unit of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International Affairs at the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), the current struggle for democratic rights in Africa calls for the need to empower laity in their own churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If individuals fighting for their democratic rights in the political arena are the same Christians in church, then the church cannot escape the blame if it fails to stand up to the challenge of the ministry, adds Rev. Mulunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eva Chipenda, the wife of the AACC General Secretary, Rev. Jose Chipenda, says empowering the laity fits in the context of the church in Africa more than in other regions because, the ordained lot can hardly cope with the pastoral needs of the Christian community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Chipenda summarizes her concerns thus; &quot;One cannot expect the same clergy to be everywhere-burying the dead, distributing food to the hungry, healing the diseased and preaching the Word of God among other demands in the line of duty. He/she needs an extra hand and this can be provided by a well trained and prepared lay person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Charles Koech, the Education Secretary for the Catholic Bishops Conference in Kenya, says contrary to general assumptions, the Catholic church in the country is not falling behind in the process of empowering laity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gave as an example the programme of building Small Christian Communities (SCCs), instituted in 1976 by bishops in Eastern and Central Africa as a case at hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under their Association of Member Episcopal Conferences in Eastern Africa (AMECEA) the region's Catholic church leaders set up the SCCs programme in the church's desire to come closer to the people by placing most responsibilities in the hands of the laity, Mr. Koech explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his book, Ecclesia in Africa (The Church in Africa) published in 1995 and dedicated to the bishops, priests, deacons, men and women religious and all the lay faithful on the African continent, Pope John Paul II says of the laity and political leadership; &quot;We have not always done what we could in order to form the laity for life in society, to a Christian vision of politics and economics.&quot; A protracted absence of the lay faithful from this field had led them to believe that the faithful has nothing to do with politics, the Catholic pontiff regrets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among one of the many recommendations by the 6th General Assembly of the AACC, held in Harare, Zimbabwe in October 1992, was a resolution that the laity should be educated to appreciate creation. Creation theology and its practical implications, the AACC assembly stressed, must be introduced in the curricula of all theological colleges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Most existing world religions are patriarchal and define women as either inferior or surbodinate to men. Christianity, only until recently with a few exceptions, denies women the right to hold religious office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gradually, this status quo has generated a growing interest in questions relating to the place of women in Church and society. History on the other hand, demonstrates clearly the practice of discrimination against women in church and society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all due respect to the holy Book of Christian worship, feminists are concerned about the role and teaching of the Bible in Christian communities.  Reading the Bible creates an awareness of the need to re-interpret many of its passages in the light of new experiences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of concern it is not only what the Bible says, but how its message has been translated from a gender perspective to a gender sensitive language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much study has been going on regarding the language used in teaching, preaching and ritual. The repetition of prayers, hymns and scriptural passages which consistently refer to Christians as brothers or men and to God as He inculcates an idea that God is only male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last September, a new Bible entitled, The New Testament and Psalms: An Inclusive Version, was published in the United States of America with an attempt to appear more gender sensitive and less racial by eliminating references to God as Father or Son of man who is now referred to as the Human One in that translation. It was edited by Susan Brooks of the Chicago Theological Seminary and five other editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more interesting is the new translation of the Lord's Prayer; &quot;Our Father, Mother who art in heaven. However in an interview with APS Mr. Jack O.  Nandi, a leading scholar in religion argues that the Lord's prayer was handed down from Jesus Christ Himself hence it is original and without bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, undoubtedly is the height of &quot;feminist theology.&quot; But women have tried to bring out some changes to achieve a more inclusive language for the worshippers; men and women, sisters and brothers or inclusive terms like, people of God or Saints of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A renowned women's rights activist and Christian in Uganda, Ms. Maria Matembe says the (Book of) Genesis story on the creation of man and woman spells out the fact that man and woman should work side by side, that the story is not meant to exclude women from certain forms of ministry in the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Matembe is emphatic that the woman was not extracted from Adam's foot to be trampled on but from his side as a sign of equality and companionship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordination of 100 women as priests at an international convention of women pastors in Kenya's Lake Victoria port town of Kisumu recently, can hardly go unnoticed at a time when women Christians are calling for the rectification of the men to women ratio in church leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The August 14 to 17 forum organized by women from the Voice of Salvation and Healing Church in Eastern Africa and the US-based International Gospel Centre (IGC), among other concerns called for a proper interpretation of the Bible saying &quot;...tradition and culture are not always Bible-based and should not be a basis for discrimination against women. Theological and historical debates are mustered both to deny and support the claims of women's ordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one strong indicator against women's ordination remains the role and symbolic function of Christ in the ministry - the fact that Christ is the priest and the people he assigned to continue His good work were men, the 12 disciples. Further on, the teachings of the apostles like Paul seem to place women anywhere short of being ordained as priests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant to the General Secretary of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) the Rev. Phylis Byrd, says the fact that priesthood is still very male dominated is a big challenge. Ordained in 1986, Rev. Phylis Byrd feels that women have &quot;unique gifts to offer in the ministry.&quot; These include compassion which women can give out without any restrictions. Not that men do not have compassion, she adds, but society demands that they do not show compassion, especially publicly, as it might be a threat to their masculinity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the question of gender sensitive language in the Bible, Rev. Byrd, an African-American, is of the opinion that the question of the use of He or She is a grammatical issue only existent in the English language and not in the African languages. Besides, God is spirit so the question of gender does not arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the General Secretary of the AACC, Rev. Jose Chipenda, the issue of women's ordination should not arise, what should be an issue is &quot;how many women are already doing pastoral work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Chipenda, who hails from the Evangelical Congregational Church in Angola, believes that one does not have to be ordained to do God's work. What matters is if a woman is chosen as a leader of some sort in the church and she is recognized as a pastor when she is entitled to it. For such a person, says Rev. Chipenda, a space is being created for her to do more of what she does privately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian feminists have little problem with the historical and symbolic figure of Christ. Their concern is that to deny women priesthood is to oppress and diminish them and at the same time impoverish the Christian community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AACC women's desk, established in 1987, is involved in empowering Christian women in Africa in reconstruction and development. According to the desk's consultant, Dr. Christine Sadia, in the absence of a clear-cut policy on women's ordination, women who are called to serve God should be encouraged to be involved in church leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women are very comfortable identifying themselves with the role of comforter, advocate, counsellor intercessor, helper, the principle of love and unity and the giver of life. Thus they will bring special talents to enrich the ministry. Besides, it is also the work of women on a human level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the issue of women's ordination is somewhat favourably received in most Protestant circles, the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches do not ordain women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of numbers, these churches contain nearly three fifths of the Christian population worldwide. The question of ordination of women is often presented as an obstacle to greater unity among Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the question remains; Are women's legitimate aspirations and hopes to live their Christian life to the full to bear witness to the spirit in all the ministries of the church, simply to be ignored in order to achieve the unity of men and male dominated institutions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church has to acknowledge and recognize the seriousness of pastoral problems that the women's movement represents. Women no longer feel at home in a community whose leaders are all male humanity in the norm. The symbols of traditional Christianity have become empty for them. The church must treat the feminist movement with requisite theological seriousness and with all theological resources at hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theological resources of the church should be mobilized to fashion a theology based on personhood. The perception of women in the church belongs to the long list of the publicly opposed exploitation of the weak by the strong, highlighting among others Blacks, Jews, children and the physically and materially handicapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One by one, all these forms of oppression have been exposed and are now generally regarded as morally unacceptable. Similar concerted efforts should go towards the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women in the church.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi (APS - More than any other world region, Africa has indeed experienced splendid growth in Christianity. In 1900 the continent had 8 million Christians, who included 2.5 million Protestants, representing 10 per cent of the region's population. By 1990, this figure had shot to 275 million, about 57 per cent of the entire population then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering this increase, one would be forgiven for painting Africa as a place where Christian religious norms prevail. Contrary to this expectation, the continent is still gripped by evil deeds and pockets of it are simmering with a hate spirit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder the President of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Ghana, the Rt.  Rev. Dr. Paul Kofi Fynn, once charged that many Africans have not felt the spiritual impact of the Christian growth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Fynn is not alone in his observation. Equally disturbed by the unfolding events in Africa amidst the unmatched growth in the number of those who profess Christianity, is the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) Coordinator of the Church Growth and Evangelism desk and Christian Education Rev. Chalton Ochola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Ochola questions the growth of African Christianity, asserting that it has been quantitative and not necessarily reflecting quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the church has the mandate to mould the society by living according to the Gospel but regrets that it appears to have failed in this mission. And emphasizes that the church as a role model in the society, should work to influence growth and &quot;love should be the core and pillar to effect this influence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clergy says Christian teaching is about selflessness, self- sacrifice, humility, forgiveness and pity, adding that love crowns them all. Love, according to the NCCK coordinator should not be limited to fellow human beings but should also be extended to all creation including the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Ochola talks of a church that is influenced by the secular world as compared to one that influences the secular world, and qualifies this statement by citing un-Christian conduct that is witnessed not only in the secular world but also in the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick example he gives is the 1994 killings in Rwanda, whereby some church leaders were implicated. These clerics compromised their prophetic role and sided with individual ethnic groups in the widely publicised massacres which pitted the majority Hutu against the Tutsi, says the Kenyan clergy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A book entitled THE ANGELS HAVE LEFT US, by Canadian journalist Hugh McCullum, apparently derived its name from the words of a Catholic Tutsi girl who survived the massacre in a church in Ntarama, southern Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The irony of it all is that it was in Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi where the East African Revival Movement began in the late 1920s, reaching a climax in 1939 before it was embraced in Uganda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">followed by Tanzania and Kenya in 1942/43. Rev. Ochola says he finds it difficult to reconcile the spiritual awakening in the Central African region then and the aftermath of the 1994 ethnic flare-up in Rwanda and the ethnic killings still going on in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At home in Kenya, Rev. Ochola is baffled by the leadership feudings that have been going on in some churches particularly his Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK)-Anglican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this background, he calls for the church to be liberated from all sorts of evil including immorality, materialism and tribalism. &quot;The church needs to be transformed and renewed. It should review its mandate to be the salt of the earth and light of the world,&quot; he cautions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Ochola regrets that although most church buildings in Africa are filled to capacity every Sunday, projecting a scenario of solidarity and other virtues as exemplified by Christ, the faithful's observance of Bible teachings outside the Sabbath do not reflect true Christian witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vices such as embezzlement of public funds abound in many African states, yet the majority of leaders in these countries are Christians whose attendance at church every Sunday has become a public event. Political instability, mismanagement of the economy, social unrest and cultural brainwashing are common features in our countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On nepotism, deeply ingrained particularly in the public sector, Rev.  Ochola advocates for church and church-related organizations which reflect a balanced tribal representation, especially those based in cosmopolitan centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If one tribe tends to dominate such places in all categories of employment from managerial level to subordinate staff, then something is very wrong,&quot; Rev. Ochola quips. And wonders: &quot;On what ground or moral justification can the church then question the state about tribalism or its lack of gender sensitivity?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christ wants the church to apply His words to the whole life. This means that preaching of the word should not be limited to spiritual matters but also issues relating to justice, peace, prosperity and material well-being of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rev. Ochola goes further to say that Christians, and especially those in leadership positions should live exemplary lives and desist from exploiting cheap labour or oppressing those that work under them since by doing so, they display a negative perspective of what a Christian life should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributes the negative and anti-Christian behaviour displayed by some clergy to lack of spiritual commitment and to an extent rampant unemployment, which has pushed some people to priesthood only as a means of earning a living and not as a calling to this noble vocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priesthood, Rev. Ochola says, still remains a vocation which should carry with it some element of sacrificing, whether salaried or not. &quot;As God's representatives and servants, church leaders should reflect the very being and character of God who is blameless, just, righteous and loving,&quot; he advises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Ochola's assertion is similar to that of Rt. Rev. Fynn, who, quoting Lord Pober, says: &quot;How do you say you love me, when you are not aware of my sufferings.?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critical minds that have rubbed shoulders with some church leaders have expressed disillusionment with the church following the kind of attitude exhibited by some of those they have worked with away from the pulpit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owing to many unfortunate incidents in Africa including calamities like famine, drought and disease, many people have sometimes dismissed the region as a cursed continent while others have even doubted the very presence of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, John Tusa, in an article appearing in Index on Censorship Vol.25 4/1996 explains that God has always been there, spurring the church to act effectively in its role of prophetic witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He contends that Christians are sometimes put to the supreme test of faith.  This is what was witnessed in South Africa as now retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu discovered when faced with the unbelievable atrocity of the 1977 murder of African nationalist Steve Biko at the height of the liberation struggle, when the former cried aloud: &quot;Is God here at all?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, religion cannot be blamed for all evils but it is there to nurture good and a God-fearing attitude. Argues Tusa, lack of religious ingredient or just superficial application of it to ethical teaching leaves a breeding ground for evil behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Ochola appreciates that Africans are notorious religious but their faith is very superficial. He blames this superficiality on the evils that have besieged the continent. &quot;Christianity has never taken root in Africa,&quot; he quips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other African critics identify the Christian religion with imperialism, arguing that it was used as a means to pacify Africans while the colonizers exploited their resources for personal enrichment. They say early evangelism while being used to liberate people from the domain of the devil also became an ideal tool to colonize, featuring the cross and the flag as one, much like the gun and the Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But inspite of all these evils there is still hope. &quot;He will never leave us without a witness even though evils seem to multiply. God is still God and if Christians can live practical lives according to the Gospel teaching, then there is enormous opportunity of transforming Africa,&quot; says Rev. Ochola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Fynn shares similar sentiments of hope but castigates the preaching of the Gospel, saying this has changed only to suit people's physical needs, making it have no spiritual impact. Most pastors only preach sermons that help no one, he laments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, Rev. Fynn is quoted rebuking the church in Ghana for concentrating on acquiring ill-gotten wealth and looking out for members who can assist them with money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scenario in Ghana is not news, it is played in many other African countries. Many churches are accused of hypocrisy as they look for wealth instead of worshipping God, a development that has made them lose touch with members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Featuring the Church in Ghana, Africanews (July 15, 1996) says churches there seem to have put aside their mission of winning souls and turned to winning material wealth, in a setting where only the rich are being elected to Church councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church seems to have closed its eyes to the welfare of its members as it has not developed any system to assist its majority poor who remain vulnerable, an attitude Tusa sums up as self- gratification.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Although the African woman in the church today has more awareness about her rights in the pastoral service, gender discrimination from the church leadership remains a stumbling block to her advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting a paper, Celebrating God's Transforming Power, during a week- long pan-African conference for African women theologians here , Kenyan theologian, Dr. Musimbi Kanyoro, wondered &quot;what men mean when they call our initiated agenda women's issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What exactly does such a terminology communicate?&quot; posed Dr. Kanyoro to 100 African women theologians, whose discussions were centred on the theme, Transforming Power: Women in the Household of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was organised under the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians Association (CCAWTA).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan theologian, who is currently the Executive Secretary for the Women in Church and Society programme of the Geneva-based Lutheran World Federation (LWF) wondered whether universally, people understood the so- called women's issues and what role these concerns played.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Kanyoro, there is a tendency in some African societies to refer to any agenda initiated by women as &quot;women's issues&quot;. This naming, she stressed, defines those concerns as women's business with little or no relevance to men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We, the Circle women consider the issues that we address in our theology as societal issues and we seek to see the transforming power of God present in every man and woman, young and old, such that change for the betterment of all humanity in Africa can become a reality, experienced by all, not just us,&quot; Dr. Kanyoro stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Challenging the men in Africa to take their place beside women, transforming societies according to God's power as opposed to men's power, Dr.  Kanyoro added; &quot;Both men and women are like the two wings of a bird..Both are needed to be able to fly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LWF programme executive noted that women's issues will only become an integral part of the church's prophetic voice when the church realizes that sexism is a sin that requires confession and repentance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illiteracy, poverty, lack of access to health care, violence against women, under representation of women in decision making circles are societal problems, which adversely affect the lives of women, but these in themselves are by no means issues of women only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the CCAWTA does not represent an exclusive theology of women, but one in which African women are claiming the power to name the agenda and bring to the theological table issues that drastically impact on the lives of women and need to be addressed by the larger community, said Kanyoro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that the African women are new in the formal study of theology, Dr.  Kanyoro emphasized, for &quot;theology to become inclusive of us, it must begin to look different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Kanyoro, one has to dig a little deeper to understand what impact institutional expectation has on women who enter in previously male fields. In theology, she explained, the same fear exists for women, who may use terms such as Feminist Theology or Womanist Theology to describe their framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These terms are different from what has been established by male theologians, who were first in the field. It is for these reasons, that they are not so well accepted in communities both by women and men, explained the Kenyan theologian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She observed that it has been sown in the minds of our societies that to call any concern or anybody feminist is to identify that person or cause with rebelliousness, foreign principles and even a dislike for men. &quot;Hence in order to survive, feminine styles brought in by women have to be discarded or rejected,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kanyoro lamented that many sectors including the church are not prepared to change in order to accommodate women. &quot;The gates look wide open but rules for entering have not changed in the least. The consequences of this is the creation of an unhealthy environment for women,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, the African woman in theology can no longer just call for the opportunity to participate in the process but should be part of a redefining and redesigning process, understanding very clearly that what women are calling for is radical change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hence we may have to say that one of the tasks of the Circle is to help change the structures of our churches so that women will no longer be at a disadvantage,&quot; Dr. Kanyoro stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also called for the eradication of African traditional values which continue to militate against women, citing among them female circumcision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference opening was marked by the launching of two major books, Groaning in Faith and Violence Against Women, both written and edited by members of the CCAWTA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book launching was presided over by renowned Ghanaian theologian Dr.  Mercy Oduyoye and was witnessed by among others, the head of the Theology department of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) Prof. Jesse Mugambi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI - Norwegian People's Aid (NPA), an NGO working in southern Sudan has confirmed the release of six foreign missionaries held by the rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in Marpourdit near Akot near Bahrel Ghazal in south- western Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graham Wood, a spokesman for the NPA said their man on the ground at Akot, Mr. Dan Eiffe, an Irish national had facilitated the release of the missionaries on August 28. A NPA plane reportedly left north- western Kenya for southern Sudan on August 28 and it was expected to pick the three sisters, two priests and a brother from Marpourdit where they have been running a parish primary school for 1,500 children and a medical dispensary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand they are free to move about as they wish, but chose to stay on at Marpourdit,&quot; Mr. Wood told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six missionaries are Sister Moir Lynch, 73, Australian, Sister Mary Batchelor, 68, also Australian, Father Michael Barton, 48, an American, Father Michael Riel, 48, Sudanese - the Vicar General of Rumbek Diocese, Sister Maureen Grey, 52, Australian, and Brother Raniero Iacomella 26, Italian. The first four missionaries listed were actually held in Row Prison in the area while Sister Maureen and Brother Raniero were held in the compound of their mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari, Apostolic Administrator of Rumbek Diocese and Father Sesana Kizito of the Sudanese Catholic Information Office in Nairobi, told APS, the missionaries were seized at daybreak on August 17 when the mission was surrounded by SPLA fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Monsignor Mazzolari and Father Kizito flew from Nairobi to Marpourdit on August 23 and were allowed to see but not to talk to the imprisoned missionaries. &quot;We were allowed to see them for less than two minutes. I am sorry they were treated as if they were dangerous criminals,&quot; lamented Father Kizito.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local SPLA commander cited three reasons for the arrest of the missionaries: That they had obstructed the recruitment of youth in their ranks; They spied for the regime in Khartoum; They were spreading Islam under the guise of the cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are ridiculous charges. I think the local commander has grudges against the church,&quot; said Father Kizito. He said there was an informal arrangement that the SPLA would not recruit students at the mission school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Garang, a senior official of the SPLA in Nairobi said they deeply regretted the misunderstanding. He said the delay in releasing the missionaries was due to poor communication with field commanders in Marpourdit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, according to Mr. Wood, the NPA initially got involved because of their communication facilities that enhanced the negotiation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPA supports agriculture, livestock and food projects in areas of Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania with a population of 26 million people has got two public universities with an annual enrolment of about 2,000 students. These are the University of Dar es Salaam and the Sokoine University of Agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania's north-eastern neighbour Kenya, with a similar population, has four public universities namely, Nairobi and Kenyatta in the Nairobi area, and Moi and Egerton in the Rift Valley Province. The four enrol about 30,000 students every year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accra - The Catholic Church in Ghana has launched a &quot;pastoral congress&quot; to study and redefine its role in society towards the new millennium. This will include education, health and other developmental areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first ever National Catholic Pastoral Congress launched here on August 23, is also expected to propose modalities for &quot;a genuine co- operation which should exist between the Church and the State.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event is scheduled to take place from April 7 to 14, 1997 in Cape Coast, where it will draw up action programmes that will &quot;deepen the spirit of evangelisation&quot; throughout Ghana. The theme of the congress is Ecclesia in Ghana: The Church in Ghana and her Evangelising Mission in the Third Millennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to APS in an interview, Father Anthony Kornu, Assistant Secretary General of the national Catholic Secretariat said the Congress was &quot;inspired by and is a celebration&quot; of the African Bishop's Synod held in Rome in April/May, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a process to actualize the vision and recommendations of the Synod within our local Ghanaian situation or else the Pope's exhortations on the Synod may remain a continental idea on the shelves,&quot; he said. Father Kornu said that the idea is to make the church &quot;relevant, responsive, both truly African and Ghanaian and at the same time universal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some areas, father Kornu said the process will start at the parish to diocesan level building into the congress bottom-up, while in others the process may effectively start only after the actual congress. All the faithful, the clergy and the other religious, experts and consultants will participate in the process and in the main event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the congress, the church intends to undertake a deep internal analysis of herself, discover her weaknesses and areas of strength, said Bishop Francis Kofi Anani Lodonu, President of the Ghana Catholic Bishops' Conference and Bishop of Ho who performed the launching ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Lodonu, reiterated the Catholic church's commitment to justice and the defence of people's human rights and dignity. He said the church will also strive to draw the attention of &quot;all categories of citizens&quot; to their responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He singled out national reconciliation, the Gospel of love and forgiveness as important elements in the process of building one national family in diversity, tribal, religious, political or other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other issues to be discussed at the 1997 congress will include the history of the church in Ghana, methods of evangelisation, charismatic renewal in the church, ecumenism, Islam and modern means of communication.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA - The Church of the Province of Uganda House of Bishops has called on the government to ban scratch-for-cash lotteries saying they were impoverishing families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops' resolution at the end of their 13th Provincial Assembly on August 20, said the Anglican clergy were concerned about the lotteries because &quot;they encouraged crime and laziness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Bishops resolution on lotteries clearly targets the scratch- for-cash games operated by Asian businessman Mr. Sudhir Ruparelia, whose Premier Lotteries has penetrated deep into the rural areas of this East African country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premier Lotteries regularly offers huge prizes which would make many winners rich over night by Ugandan standards where rural poverty is endemic.  In one of their most recent draws, top prizes of USh.50 million ($50,000) were given out to each of the five top winners. Furthermore, numerous smaller prizes may be won besides houses and vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Asian proprietor has reportedly made millions of US dollars in the last six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Bishops Secretary the Rt. Rev. Christopher Senyonjo said the government should &quot;immediately take steps to abolish the lotteries as this will help boost morals in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the bishops' concern, a number of the country's Members of Parliament in the new legislature called for drastic control of the scratch- for-cash games, saying many people in the villages had abandoned productive labour to devote their energies to the lotteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Mike Mukula, MP for Soroti Municipality in eastern Uganda, said an age limit to gambling in the lotteries should be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we encourage young children to gamble - even at the age of two years - then we will end up with and irrational society,&quot; he cautioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Ugandan MPs expressed anger that the government had charged taxes payable by Premier at 15 per cent instead of the 30 per cent stated in a contract with the firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers believe that while the government will now be obliged to do something about the Asian owned lottery, there will be a serious problem with what to do with thousands of youth who are employed as ticket sellers by the company.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Any intervention efforts aimed at reducing the widely practised female circumcision (FC) in Kenya must incorporate a role for church leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during a dissemination seminar on research findings on female circumcision by the Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) here on August 23, PATH staff revealed that churches are a major institution for community out-reach on female circumcision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to PATH, a non-governmental organization (NGO) interviews with church leaders during the research confirmed that the position taken by churches in the community is crucial in determining the extent of female circumcision in that community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PATH however cautioned the Catholic church's silence and lack of position on the practice, saying that the church commands a large following in the country and particularly in the three districts under study namely Nyeri (Central Province), Embu and Machakos (both in Eastern Province).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research findings in the three districts also revealed that many Catholic church members are practising female circumcision because their church does not condemn it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, Catholic leaders interviewed said the church should not dictate abandonment of the practice to its members but should also provide information on female circumcision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreso, church leaders agreed that female circumcision results in harmful health effects and as a practice, it has outlived its cultural usefulness, the research found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some church leaders felt that their church should actively oppose female circumcision, others believed that its practice or non-practice should be left to individual church members,&quot; added the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, PATH said it did not establish unanimity of views on the question of the role the church should play in encouraging abandonment of female circumcision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other church leaders interviewed belong to the (Anglican) Church of the province of Kenya (CPK), Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) and the Independent Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any meaningful efforts to end the practice, PATH found out, should involve stake holders as well as encourage active participation of both men and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization called for combined effort from churches, government officials, schools and community organizations to help in educating the community on the dangers of female circumcision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PATH also called on the Kenyan government to clear its stand on FC saying that many people believe the authorities are indifferent to its existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because mothers, mothers-in-law and grandmothers play a key role in decision making on FC, PATH advocated that these women must be particular targets of information which can help them change their attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during the seminar, an Assistant Minister for Education Mrs. Agnes Ndetei said there is need to incorporate lessons on harmful traditional practices in the school curricula. Circumcisers should also be part and parcel of the process when developing alternative rituals or practices to female circumcision, the seminar was told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Female circumcision is practised in about 30 of Kenya's 60 districts and it is estimated that 50 per cent of girls and women in the country have been circumcised. Women (and girls) comprise 50 per cent of the national population of 26 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PATH has conducted an extensive research on female circumcision in the districts mentioned earlier on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization has also collaborated with the National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) in sensitizing and mobilizing the nursing profession to fight for the eradication of female genital mutilation (FGM) in the West African country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - The American Coptic Union (ACU) has urged the United States Congress to investigate killings of Christians in Egypt and postpone aid to Egypt until basic rights and security are secured for all citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued here on August 25, the ACU also issued a plea for help from US President Clinton, Roman Catholic Pope John Paul II, and &quot;our Jewish brothers&quot; following a string of violent attacks on Coptic Christians by Muslim militants in Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its statement, the ACU also criticized the Egyptian authorities for taking away guns owned by Coptic Christians as part of a partial weapons ban.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACU, which claims to speak for the 2.5 million American Copts, as well as &quot;the 12 million-plus Egyptian Copts in a country where they now have no voice,&quot; declared: &quot;The American Coptic Union requests that the US Congress immediately send a fact-finding commission to investigate murders and persecutions of Coptic Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also urged that the 2.1 billion dollars a year in &quot;US-Egyptian foreign aid be postponed until basic human rights and security for all citizens are secured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call came only four days after Egyptian police said that two Christian brothers were killed in southern Egypt on August 21 by Muslim militants who accused them of cooperating with the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanna Maurice Ayub, 35, and his brother Ayub Maurice Ayub, 25, were shot to death while returning to their field in the village of Kalandul in the Malawi area, 300 kilometers south of Cairo, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The militants suspected the Coptic, or Egyptian Orthodox brothers of giving information on their hideouts to the authorities, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third Copt, Mukhtar Hanna Mikhail, a 47-year-old farmer, was critically wounded on August 21 by Muslim fundamentalists in al-Rod village in Malawi and was hospitalized with gunshot wounds in the stomach and chest, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The militants also accused the wounded man of informing on them, police said, adding that the attackers in both incidents were still at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on August 17, the Islamic militants shot dead two Coptic Christians and injured three other people in a series of simultaneous raids on jewellers' shops in the southern Egyptian town of Tahta, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five militants armed with automatic weapons struck three shops in the same road in Tahta, situated 480 kilometres south of Cairo in Sohag province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They killed two Coptic jewellers, Metri Atta Ateya and Safwat Shafiq, and injured three other people including a six-year-old Coptic boy and a Muslim engineer hit by bullets as the gang made their escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the attackers escaped in a hijacked lorry with large quantities of gold and jewels, adding that they were from Egypt's main armed militant Islamic group the Jamaa Islamiyya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the killings brought to 1,052 the number of people gunned down by the Islamic extremists in the wave of militant violence that began in March 1992.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - The Church of England will on September 25 consecrate Ugandan clergy Canon John Sentamu as the first African bishop in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Sentamu, 47, who was ordained priest in 1979 after reading theology at Cambridge University, England, has been the Vicar of Holy Trinity and St.  Matthias, Tulse Hill in the Diocese of London, since 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also been a member of General Synod since 1985 and co-Chair of the Southwark Diocesan Synod since 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mid-May, this year, the Church of England appointed him as bishop of Stepney in the London Diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A press release here announcing his appointment as bishop quotes Canon Sentamu saying; &quot;My first priority is God, seeking God's rule of justice, righteousness, peace and love. Secondly change, to be a part of God's movement of change and discovering the landscape of hope, meeting real concerns with real life and thirdly outreach, loitering with intent by standing at the intersection, where human need and God's love meet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when he is finally consecrated, Rev. Sentamu, a former junior judge of the High Court of Uganda, the homeland he fled for England during the terror reign of dictator idi Amin in the 70s, will become the third black bishop in the Church of England after the Bishop of Rochester and the Bishop of Croydon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a telephone interview with APS, Rev. Sentamu said; &quot;I am not being consecrated for the Church of England, although that is what it is, literally.  But I see myself being consecrated for the Church of God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He elaborated that when one is ordained for the Church of God, the question of where one pastorally serves does not arise. Whether in Africa or England, the end result will be the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the generally held opinion that churches in Europe are not &quot;filled to capacity&quot; as is the case in churches in Africa, Rev. Sentamu said; &quot;It is true, sometimes a church minister may come face to face with a half-packed church during worship as compared to the booming mood, on the African continent but that would vary from place to place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed; &quot;In my case, I have not yet come across that type of situation.  Wherever I have served and preached, the church has been full. Maybe one has to think seriously on what to chip in pastorally in order to liven the congregation as a way of avoiding a situation of half-attendance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishop-elect added, &quot;I have always tried to incorporate the African singing and the playing of African drums as part of my strategy to liven the church. This, I can tell you, has made a lot of differences in terms of church attendance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the relationship with his home Anglican church, Rev. Sentamu said he believes his elevation to the bishopric will strengthen this bond but this will also depend on the issues being handled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He talked of his scheduled travel to Uganda next year to participate in the centenary celebrations of the Church of the Province of Uganda Ruwenzori Diocese.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lome - African states have been urged to &quot;examine, adapt and master&quot; the emerging new communication technologies such as Internet and the Information Super Highway which on the eve of the third millenium offer both &quot;promises and threats to our societies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a four-point statement issued at the end of a three-day meeting held here, 12 church leaders from eight Central and West African Francophone countries also called on African countries to stop immediately the arbitrary use of the media in total disregard of &quot;the present socio-political contexts of our countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the media at random, they said, had contributed to the fratricide fragmentation, sectional clashes and violence that are now more widespread on the continent. In addition, the practice and especially untruthful information and false denials, had resulted in a &quot;confidence crisis&quot; between governments and the governed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting organized from August 14 to 16 by the Service d'Information des Eglises d'Afrique (SIEA), the churches press agency for Francophone Africa based here, was called to sensitize church leaders and functionaries on the important role of communication in their work and on the promises, problems and challenges of new communication technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants included church leaders from the Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Benin and the host country, Togo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others who attended the consultation included officials from the Nairobi- based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) led by General Secretary Rev.  Jose Chipenda, the World Association for Christian Communication (WACC) represented by General Secretary Carlos Valle and Regional Coordinator Africa and Middle East Ms. Julienne Munyaneza from Rwanda, officials from the Evangelical Community for Apostolic Action (CEVAA) in Paris, SIEA staff, among them the Executive Director Pastor Andree Moussanga from Cameroon and the local press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was an eye opener that challenges us to take the role of communication and the implications of new communication technologies more seriously, Sr. Odile Homawoo of the Social Communications Department of the Togo Catholic Secretariat told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rudolf Apedo-Amah, Vice-President of the Methodist Church in Togo shares similar sentiments. In addition, he intends to encourage his church to give some priority to the training of communication professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Wide Web, one of the newest and fastest growing communication technologies, offers computer users increased access to information in the form of pictures, sound or voice and colour mechanisms. Ghana, Togo's western neighbour is believed to be the first country in the West African sub-region to benefit from this facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the consultation in Lome was coming to an end, in Ghana, 100 participants drawn from financial institutions, universities, and research organizations were taking part in a one-day seminar on Internets's World Wide Web in the capital city, Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organized by Network Computer System (NCS) Limited for its users and potential users of the Internet, the seminar was the fourth in a series this year. NCS is committed to strengthen the country in terms of information technology through software development, Dr. Nii Quaynor, NCS Executive Chairman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their statement, church leaders participating in the Lome consultation also called on the churches and National Christian Councils to develop a more positive mentality and critical awareness of communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communication they said, is a modern and necessary vehicle through which biblical messages, Christian witness and service as well as social and other education for all the people of God could be mediated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On networking, the statement called for the creation of a sub- regional pool to promote the collection and sharing of information on the life of churches in order to &quot;initiate and intensify inter- ecclesiatic solidarity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clergy emphasized the need to &quot;diversify methods of communicating the Christian message, particularly in the animation of religious programmes on radio and television,&quot; especially given the new challenges facing society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - My Dear Readers,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two things are worrying me of late. First are the ongoing &quot;bilateral&quot; talks being conducted by President Frederick Chiluba. The President announced his intentions in Maseru, Lesotho where he assured leaders of the Southern African development Community (SADC) that he was ready to met the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since that announcement, he and his press aide Richard Sakala have insisted that the talks will be one on one. I do not know what the President expects to achieve with that approach especially that there is little time left before an agreement can be reached.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of time leads me to the second point of my writing this article. The MMD mandate expires on October 31, 1996. I concur with the views of Zambia Democratic Congress president Dean Mung'omba and I repeat them here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would like to remind President Chiluba that his term of office comes to an end on October 31. At that time whether he likes it or not Zambians will not allow him to continue,&quot; Mung'omba said in an interview on Monday. He went on to call on the Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube to be ready to takeover in an interim administration. In the present circumstances this makes sense because we cannot allow President Chiluba to continue destroying this country as he has already done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know that government chief spokesman, minister of information Amusaa Mwana-mwambwa is on record claiming that the MMD mandate ends on November 30.  That is absolute nonsense. The 1991 elections were on October 31 and by November 2 it was clear that Kaunda had reached the end of the road and he immediately conceded defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our system of government did not allow Kaunda to stay a day longer. He immediately handed over power to Chiluba. And in any case, if Kaunda had tried to stay a little longer not only would Chiluba and the MMD not have allowed but they would have agitated for unrest. They would have regarded Kaunda as a bad loser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus effectively President Chiluba's mandate started on November 1, 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement by Mwana-mwambwa arises from desperation. Somehow MMD leaders now realise that they have squandered their five years in power and have nothing to show for it. They have done everything against people's expectations and wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They failed to conduct local government elections last year and somehow in their warped logic they hope they can do the same for the presidential and parliamentary elections. That is unacceptable, morally wrong and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1991 the MMD made calls for a transitional government. The call provided pressure on Kaunda's government and he listened and accommodated the dmands of the opposition. But President Chiluba has shown how incapable he is in handling matters of state. Already, despite the agreement by his cabinet that Kaunda should finally be allowed to contest this year's election, he is dragging his feet on the matter. He and his government is failing to accommodate the opposition on the electoral process, the messed up voters register prepared by Nikuv and the apartheid constitution they have imposed on the people. This failure to listen to the majority supports Mung'omba's view that come October 31, 1996 Chiluba should cease to be president of this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am aware that his legal advisers are trying to play around with the law by tying the presidency to parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard they are deliberately delaying the dissolution of parliament because doing so would tie them to 90 days within which elections should be held and a new National Assembly be convened. Thus Chiluba is waiting for the last moment, possibly last week of October to disolve the house, a move which would give him upto last week of January, 1997 for the new National Assembly to convene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This scheme by Chiluba must be stopped at all cost. Elections must be held in October, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I love you all,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Opposition politicians and civic leaders have demanded for the re- opening of the Baldwin Nkumbula Commission of Inquiry following the confession by Patrick Mubanga Kafuti that late former National Party president was killed by State House agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there were, however, unconfirmed reports that police had yesterday picked Kafuti following The Post story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kafuti was picked up for questioning by the Inspector General (IG) of Police and deputy minister in the Office of the President Eric Silwamba,&quot; a police source claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to confirm this, however, failed as the IG refused to answer Post calls and Silwamba could not be contacted at the office or home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video recorded confession, obtained by The Post, Kafuti says Nkumbula was shot by State House security personnel and claims President Frederick Chiluba begged him not to tell anyone the &quot;true&quot; story about Nkumbula's tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the opposition and civic groups called for the immediate resignation of the MMD government unless Kafuti's claims can be disproved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Zambia United Front (ZUFRO) chairman, Mike Kaira, President Chiluba should resign immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ZUFRO demands the immediate resignation of Chiluba, his Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda, Minister of Home Affairs Chitalu Sampa and the Inspector General of Police, Francis Ndhlovu,&quot; said Kaira in a telephone interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaira indicated that ZUFRO &quot;will put up a petition to the highest court in the land to stop President Chiluba from contesting public office over this matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Baldwin's death cannot be in vain,&quot; Kaira said. &quot;If we leave this matter as it is, tomorrow it may be you or me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) president, Dean Mung'omba, added that his party had never been satisfied with the Nkumbula Commission of Inquiry report, especially that it was released three months after it was handed over to State House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These accusations are directed at President Chiluba and his family. We leave it up to him to exculpate himself within two days to show that he was not involved,&quot; Mung'omba said at a press briefing yesterday. &quot;That is the problem of lying. Lies always catch up with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former vice president in the UNIP government, Mainza Chona, said: &quot;I call upon the government to re-open the Nkumbula Commission of Inquiry in order to give an opportunity to this young man, Kafuti, to give his evidence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chona, President Chiluba's son, Castro, should also be made to give evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Commission of Inquiry is completely inadequate without the evidence of Castro,&quot; Chona said. &quot;If Castro is not well, as they claim, then the Commission of Inquiry should adjourn sine die until he is well enough to give evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inter-African Network Human Rights and Development (AFRONET) executive director, Ngande Mwanajiti, said Kafuti's revelation was &quot;shocking&quot; and stressed that &quot;nobody has the right to take away life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was shocked at Kafuti's confession,&quot; Mwanajiti said after watching</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the video of Kafuti's confession yesterday. &quot;If what he said is true, it does raise a few concerns and certainly calls for clarification. The man has said what he has to say. He was there and it becomes difficult to dismiss what he has said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, said it was unfortunate that Kafuti decided to tell lies during the Commission of Inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although he does explain the context why he lied, the law has to take it's course,&quot; Mwanajiti said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Nkumbula's close friend, Mweene Hamazila, called on President Chiluba and security officers not to victimise or harass Kafuti for &quot;spilling the beans&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am asking the President and his defence minister Ben Mwila, not to victimise or harass Kafuti,&quot; Hamazila said, explaining: &quot;Kafuti is a patriotic Zambian and his conscience has been troubling him ever since the accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspector General of Police Francis Ndhlovu, who was invited to come and watch Kafuti's recorded interview, sent his detective chief inspector Mbangu Mbangu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamazila also added his voice to the demand for President Chiluba to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Chiluba is a Christian, as he claims, then he should resign immediately, &quot; Hamazila said. &quot;The state repudiated Stanley Hamusonde's testimony during the Commission of Inquiry but his testimony tallies with what Kafuti has said.  The Commission of Inquiry didn't go to the root of the investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Lima Party co-chairman, Guy Scott, however, declined to comment stating:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is difficult to make a comment from someone's confession. However, we will soon be sitting as a party and we will definitely make our stand known,&quot; Scott said in a telephone interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State House press aide, Richard Sakala, refused to be drawn into any discussion over the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to comment on that,&quot; Sakala told The Post in a telephone interview yesterday before hanging up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The National Lima Party was launched last Saturday at a rally in the farming town of Mum-bwa, some 173 kilo-metres west of Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new party's co-chairmen - former Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) president Ben Kapita and former agriculture minister Guy Scott - took turns to launch the Lima Party with a promise to improve the lot of farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People ask why I am in partisan politics when I have spent the last 20 years fighting for a better deal for farmers. I have found that because we have allowed too many town boys they don't understand farmers,&quot; Kapita said on Saturday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dubbed &quot;the big one&quot; in advertisements before the rally and with &quot;power to the farmer&quot; slogan the launch took off to a slow start with less than three hundred people ready to listen to the party's message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People say we have come late,&quot; Scott said. &quot;We have come late because we were waiting for all other parties to die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott added: &quot;If we had come at the same time as National Party, Zambia Democratic Congress and Liberal progressive Front, you would have been confused. Now in the whole country executives from MMD, NP, ZDC and LPF are joining us because everyone has seen what the Lima Party stands for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott, who appealed to his audience to vote for his party warned farmers not to allow a one party state whether under UNIP or the MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's get the fire going. We don't have time. If you allow a one party state to continue under MMD or UNIP next year don't come crying to me or Ben Kapita,&quot; Scott said. &quot;We are doing something about it now but you have to come with us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Kapita who laid out his agricultural based manifesto also promised that his party will give power to the farmers who grow our cotton and to those who have been retrenched as they will go back to the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is a great day for Zambia. Enough is enough. Power to the farmer.  Today is a great day for Zambia as we launch the national Lima Party,&quot; Kapita said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The ZCCM operations quarterly report released in Lusaka yesterday indicated that the price of copper would remain uncertain because of prevailing low prices on the London Metal Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market experienced a very significant drop in LME prices during the quarter ended June 30 from US$2,841 per tonne on May 9, 1996 to US$1,830 per tonne on June 27, 1996,&quot; the report disclosed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It revealed that the average sales realisation for copper, at K2,715 million per tonne for the quarter, was 19 per cent higher than the K2,275 million per tonne realised in the corresponding quarter of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the statement further explained that the higher returns came as a result of the depreciation of the Kwacha - the average copper price achieved for the quarter was US$2,226 per tonne compared to $2,668 for the corresponding period of the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, ZCCM recorded an operating profit of K59,972 million in the quarter ended June 30, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After taking into account exchange losses, interest, taxation charges and other items, the Group made a net profit of K14,676 million, compared with a net profit of K12,051 million in the same period of 1995,&quot; read the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, revenue from sales of precious metals amounted to K300 million during the quarter, compared to sales of K819 million during the corresponding period of the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement confirmed that copper production at 83, 892 tonnes for the quarter was lower than the 87,420 tonnes achieved in the June quarter of 1995.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - President Bakili Muluzi, who in the past two years has touted his unwavering stance on upholding freedom of the press, has in an unprecedented change of style, sued a local newspaper. This is the first time he has done so since he took over power in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muluzi has sued the Tribute newspaper for defamation following an article the paper published alleging that Muluzi grabbed land worth over K500,000 (US$33,334) from his late Blantyre friend, a Mr Duncalo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel for Muluzi, Viva Nyimba of Legalwise, said he had been asked him to institute the lawsuit because the article contained a lot of malice, lies and insults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High Court in Blantyre has all ready issued an injunction on the publishers, Din Akwete Publications, editor Din Balakasi and printers, Uniprint Limited restraining the newspaper from publishing articles with innuendoes or defamatory words with reference to Muluzi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suit is a complete about-face by Muluzi who has always insisted that suing the fledgling press was a sure way of stifling the freedom of press the country was enjoying. Last year, he refused to put into law the publications bill passed by parliament, requiring all newspapers to indicate the names of the editor, publisher and printer, making him the darling of the press at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, with this lawsuit, the writing is on the wall that the media's honeymoon with the president is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Lady, Anne also asked Legalwise to sue a Lilongwe based weekly The Statesman, restraining it from carrying a column, Dear Anne, which used to indirectly deride her and Mulzui without clearly making reference to them.  The injunction was granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, opposition MCP Publicity Secretary Hetherwick Ntaba said on August 22 his party was concerned about a statement made by State President Bakili Muluzi in which he suggested that he would bar MCP's life president Kamuzu Banda from running for president in the 1999 presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muluzi told a mass rally in Dedza central Malawi, on August 20 that he would not allow the former president to run for the state presidency saying Banda was too old and ailing to run the country. Muluzi was reacting to media reports which quoted some MCP officials as saying that Banda's MCP intends to reinstate its life president to state house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muluzi said he would not allow some MCP leaders to use Banda by ruling the country from his back. ''As far as my government is concerned, Dr Banda retired and he is receiving his retirement benefits and there is no way he can run for the presidency again in 1999,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ntaba challenged Muluzi saying that the Malawi constitution does not bar anyone from standing for the presidency due to old age. ''We might be heading for the Zambian scenario where the ruling party has influenced the amendment of the constitution to bar the former president Kenneth Kaunda from standing as a presidential candidate.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - MPs WANT MORE RESPECT ON LOCAL RADIO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of parliament, in their quest for more honour from the general public, have directed the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation radio to refer to them as Honourable in its broadcasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We started referring to them as honourable following a directive we received from the Clerk of Parliament,'' said Acting Director General of MBC, Sam Gunde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior Assistant Clerk of Parliament, David Bandawe said the decision was made by the MPs themselves who resolved during their May sitting of parliament that they too should be addressed as honourable on MBC radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">30 YEARS FOR STEALING K1 MILLION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Blantyre High Court on August 22 sentenced a former Malawi Posts and Telecommunications employee to 30 years imprisonment with hard labour for stealing over K1 million (US$ 66,667).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Chimasula Phiri found Dockland Chimberenga, 35, who was a supervisor at the MPTC, guilty of theft by a person employed in the public service contrary to section 278 as read with section 283 subsection 1 of the penal code. He also ordered that Chimberenga's property be seized and sold to make up for the lost money.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROAD TOLL IN THE PIPELINE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motorists in Malawi may soon start contributing to a road fund to ensure proper maintenance of public roads in the country. Feasibility studies for the road fund are currently being carried out by British and Spanish consultancy firms. The European Union is funding the K20 million (US$1.34 million) project which started on June 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daud Kara, Road Maintenance Initiative Co-ordinator, said government intends to introduce road user charges like fuel levy, toll fees, vehicle licensing and examination fees, and traffic fines among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A private firm might be commissioned to manage the road maintenance. Toll gates and weigh bridges would be placed at the country's city boundaries and every truck passing through would pay a certain amount towards road maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECOND CHANNEL SWITCHED OFF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi's much-talked about second channel on the country's national radio, the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation will not take off as anticipated because donors have withheld funding for the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source from MBC, who asked for anonymity, said the German government, which had allocated K99 million (US$6.6 million) for the project had all of sudden decided not to release the money saying that they wanted to give the project more consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said all the groundwork for Channel Two, which was scheduled to be operational by December this year, had already started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MBC source said the Germans had decided to carry out more research and consultations to find out whether the project was really a priority for the country. This research, said the source, was likely to take one or two years and its findings would determine if the project was worth funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second channel was expected to relieve pressure from the much congested single channel radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD BANK READY TO HELP MALAWI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank said on August 16 it was ready to assist Malawi develop alternative strategies for diversifying power supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the commissioning of Tedzani Three hydro-electric power station, acting World Bank resident representative in Malawi, James Smith said this was an immediate area of concern where his bank may be able to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power station, with a generation capacity of 50 megawatts, was financed by the International Development Association, the Preferential Trade Area, Austria and the Netherlands to the tune of K1.3 billion (US$86 million). The new power station will enable the country's power utility to expand its total generation capacity from 164 to 214 megawatts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith said if necessary the bank would consider helping with an emergency pumping project to maintain flows out of Lake Malawi in the event that the Shire River runs dry. He said WB was currently working with the government to confirm the economic and environmental feasibility of the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">K70 MILLION YOUTH FUND LAUNCHED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bakili Muluzi on August 9 launched a K70 million (US$75 million) credit fund for the youth of Malawi to help start small scale businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All unemployed young people aged between 15 and 30 are eligible to borrow from the Youth Development and Credit Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, some government critics have said that they feel the scheme lacks proper accountability and warn that many who might be considered most deserving may not have access to the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MALAWI CONDEMNS BURUNDI'S MILITARY REGIME</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi has joined the international community and called on the military regime in Burundi to urgently embark on peaceful negotiations with all parties in the country's conflicts for reconciliation and a speedy return to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Malawi is committed to democratic principles and therefore does not support any government that comes to power through undemocratic means,'' Malawi's Foreign Affairs minister George Ntafu said on August 8 at a dinner hosted in honour of the Organisation of African Unity Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim who was in the country for a four-day visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntafu said the Malawi government commended the efforts and initiatives undertaken by the OAU and leaders other African countries towards resolving the Burundi conflict. In his response, Salim said he was confident economic sanctions that other African countries had imposed on Burundi would work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONDOMS BIG RISK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi's Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation are locked in a wrangle over the quality of condoms that the country receives as donations in the fight against the spread of HIV and STD infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry says some of the donated condoms are sub-standard and therefore a risk to HIV or STD infection, but WHO insists there is no risk at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of this discovery by the ministry, the government is to set up a condom testing centre at a cost of US 1 million to test all condoms donated to the country to ensure that they are of high quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Technical Services Controller in the health ministry, Professor Roma Khonje said some of the condoms being supplied to the country had proved to be sub-standard and were a risk to users who could get infected with HIV and other STDs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been receiving reports about some condoms being porous when tested with water or air, so we have found it necessary as health authorities to do something about this,'' said Khonje, who emphasised he had personally tested some condoms which proved to be porous. Khonje said a proposal for a condom testing centre has been met with resistance from donors who will have nothing to do with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO officials say the condoms could not be porous unless the storage conditions were poor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Some called it babies week, and others said it was a mothers week. Whatever the term, it was not an unusual sight on August 20 and 21 to see mothers with babies strapped to their backs as they flocked to the nearest hospitals, clinics and health centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were responding to a Ministry of Health and Population programme for toddlers to be immunised against polio and receive Vitamin-A supplement. This was the second phase of the poliomyelitis eradication campaign in which all children under the age of five were required to receive the polio vaccine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first phase of the campaign, aimed at eradicating polio as a public health problem by the year 2000, was conducted on 16 and 17 June throughout the country. Nearly one million children under five were immunised against the disease, according to ministry officials. The campaign is targeted at three million children and the ministry is hopeful that this objective will be achieved by the end of the second phase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A visit to Malawi's largest referral hospital, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, where though figures of those already immunised have not yet been disclosed , long queues of mothers with their babies, told a story of the success of the campaign so far. Organisers of the campaign said the second phase had received a better response from the public than the first one phase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On average, officials said, only about 65% of the children received the vaccine and Vitamin A supplement during the first phase. A nurse at one of Blantyre's clinics said the campaign was marred by a number of misconceptions.  Some of these alleged that the drug being used to immunise the children against polio was aimed at killing the children's fertility so that they should not be able to bear children when they reached adulthood. But the ministry clarified some of these misconceptions on radio and in newspapers which helped to create understanding and hence the increased numbers of mothers appearing during the second phase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polio is an infectious disease caused by a virus in which the spinal cord becomes inflamed resulting in paralysis. In 1979, a survey was conducted in Malawi which results showed the prevalence of polio estimated at seven per every 1,000 children under five. There were 17,631 children affected by polio of the 2.7 million under fives. Following the findings, the Ministry of Health, together with the British Save the Children Fund, launched what was called the ''attack phase'' of the mass immunisation program against polio in form of a village to village campaign from April 1980 to July 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this exercise, 80% of the children from birth to two years were immunised and there was evidence that there was a reduction in 1983 compared to 1979. After the attack phase, the polio immunisation programme was extended into ''maintenance phase'' through a network of clinics for children under five. In 1988, the World Health Organisation Assembly set the year 2000 as the global target of polio eradication which was endorsed by the member states including Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, Malawi has been providing polio immunisation to new born babies through its expanded programme on immunisation. Through this program, Malawi reached the universal child immunisation target of 80% a year, earlier than the targeted year of 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high levels of immunisation coverage have since been maintained and the just completed polio immunisation campaign, with four years to the year 2000 is one of the ''last touches'' towards the complete eradication of the disease which the ministry says is an achievable goal.</SPAN></P>

Singh, popularly known as 'The Flying Sikh', leads the standings with 50 points and needs to only finish in a respectable position in Kenyan Equator and the South African PSC rallies to clinch the title.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">His nearest rival is Azar Anwar of Kenya who has 42 points but Singh is confident of withstanding the pressure and bagging the title again. Three other drivers chasing the title are South Africa's Peter Lansdell (24 points), and Kenyans Sammy Aslam and Asd Anwar on 20 and 15 points respectively. Satwant first won the championship in 1988, repeating the feat in 1989, 1991 and 1993.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The national soccer team has stepped up training for up-coming Africa and World Cup engagements but with uncertainty about the availability of the team's foreign-based players. Danish coach Roald Poulsen has been drilling home-based players on a three-day per week schedule but keeping his fingers crossed about the arrival of professional players, including the inspirational captain, Kalusha Bwalya, who plays for Club America in Mexico.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalusha has indicated that he would only be available for World Cup qualifying matches. Zambia plays Mozambique in an Africa Cup qualifying match next month and takes on Congo in a World Cup qualifier in November. Key defender, Harrison Chongo, who plays in Saudi Arabia, has also said that he would no longer be available for national team assignments. The pressure on Poulsen could, however, be eased by reports that a former top national team mid-fielder, Charles Musonda, has recovered sufficiently from a long injury and could be available for national duties.  There is currently a growing demand that the Football Association of Zambia, ensure that Musonda be made available to Poulsen to be considered for the national team. Musonda, after about two years of inactivity, is back at top Belgian side, Anderlecht.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The argument that sanctions against countries do not always directly hurt only the people who are supposed to feel the pinch, is turning out to be true for Zambia, which has joined other countries in the region in imposing a trade embargo against Burundi. Although Zambia does not share a common border with Burundi, the decision to join other countries in imposing sanctions is hurting that country as much as it is hurting Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most hit by the trade sanctions are two major Zambian companies - the Zambia Sugar Company and the Chilanga Cement Company, both of which export thousands of tonnes of their respective products to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depending on the length of the sanctions, the ZSC could lose about US$3 million through loss of business in exports to Burundi, whose military regime countries in the region are opposing. David Covell, managing director of the company says, however, the loss in business is only about one-seventh of the company's total exports which stand at 69,000 tonnes per year, about 9,000 tonnes of which are sold to Burundi. Already the flow has stopped and the company is now concentrating on shipping the product to other markets in the region - Zaire, Tanzania and Kenya, countries that have also joined in the imposition of sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia would still have had a problem in exporting the product even if it did not also impose sanctions. The exports have to pass through Tanzania or Rwanda, both of which have closed their common borders with Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A handful of reformed prostitutes have drawn the attention of the nation, including President Chiluba, because of their remarkable reformation from hardcore sex workers to positively productive members of society. Women who confess to having had countless sex partners as a means of earning income, are today earning a living in a less risky manner, through a pilot project initiated by an expert in AIDS and HIV.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the former sex workers now may be carrying the AIDS virus but they are determined to live positive lives. The project, named Tasinta (meaning we have changed), provides counselling and training in various skills, one of them being tailoring. Project director, Professor Dr Nkandu Luo, the only Zambian female professor, says she was compelled to start the project in order to provide a positive contribution to the fight against AIDS. It is hoped, with projects like Tansita, that the spread of AIDS will at least be reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there are only about a dozen people in the project, Professor Luo frequently ventures out to counsel those still in the trade. She says initially the task was difficult but now with the help of those who have reformed, the burden is less heavy, although there still is a lot to be done.  President Chiluba, pleased with the initiative, recently toured the project and said such a creative approach to national problems would help develop Zambia. The problem of prostitution, blamed on harsh economic hurdles, is, however, still a major source of concern for the government, especially because of the AIDS pandemic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Glaring errors in the registration of voters has prompted some local election monitoring groups and some opposition political parties to call for either the use of national identity cards or use of the old voters register. The Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) and the Foundation for Democracy (FODEP) have expressed concerns over the numerous mistakes in the updated voters register, suggesting the national identity cards be used instead in the voting process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMT president, Alfred Zulu, says that many Zambians could be deprived of the right to vote because of mistakes in the register, and the situation made worse as not every eligible voter may have registered. Some observers note that use of national identity cards could result in non-Zambians participating in the elections as the document is easily obtainable. The MMD also says UNIP's suggestion of using voters register from 1989 would deprive thousands of Zambians not registered then, of the chance to vote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, thousands of people have been left off the voters register, in an exercise being carried out by Nikuv a company from Israel - and held in suspicion by some opposition parties. But Nikuv project leader, Gershom Korda, says that the essence of voters collecting their cards long before the elections is to verify the data available and make appropriate corrections before polling day. NIKUV, the computer company engaged by the government to up-date the voters register, has announced that over 40,000 people have been omitted from lists in the latest round of data verification. Korda confirmed that 40,992 people had been left out but promised that the anomaly would be rectified. He also assured critics and sceptics of the company that the exercise was being carried out efficiently and would be completed on time. He allayed fears of vote-rigging and invited all interested persons to visit the computer centre to verify data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In further election news, former president Kenneth Kaunda should forget about trying to get back to the country's leadership because there is nothing he can do now that he failed to do during his 27 years of rule, according to the Zambian government. Vice-president, Godfrey Miyanda, said Dr Kaunda should withdraw into the background, play the role of advisor for all politicians in Zambia, including President Frederick Chiluba. He said it was about time the 72-year-old Kaunda realised that his era was past and allowed the younger generation to chart Zambia's political course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kaunda has repeatedly said that his decision to come out of retirement was out of concern over &quot;younger men&quot; of the MMD government allegedly failing to run the country properly. He said he had wished to play the advisory role soon after his retirement but this did not come off because his advice was never sought. However, Gen. Miyanda notes that even with the apparent sour relations between the two, it is possible that Dr Kaunda could give advice to President Chiluba. Should he return to power, Dr Kaunda promises to serve for only as long as it would take to &quot;hand over to young and honest men&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - While increasing numbers of foreign countries are showing interest in buying the giant mining conglomerate, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, political parties are still haggling over the rationale behind selling it.  The ruling MMD has stuck to its privatisation promise to have the company sold off as an entity, but some opposition parties are calling for caution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Minister Ronald Penza says the conglomerate, which generates about 90% of Zambia's foreign income, has to be sold as planned within two years as government should no longer play a part in business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia Privatisation Agency (ZPA), says that all is on course and that about 10 major international companies have shown interest in investing, including Anglo Vaal, Anglo American Corporation, Gencor Mines, Noranda, Phelps Dodge, Cyprus Amax, African Minerals Corporation and Straits Resources.  The companies have sent experts to assess investment prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tenders close February 28, 1997. The ZPA is still silent on the number of bids submitted but its executive director, Valentine Chitalu, says the response is encouraging. UNIP, the main opposition party, is opposed to &quot; rushing&quot; through the selling of the ZCCM and states that should the party return to power after presidential and parliamentary elections later this year, it will halt the sale. Another opposition party, the Zambia Democratic Congress, states that while it is not opposed to the sell of the conglomerate, the company should be broken up into separate firms to avoid a monopoly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambian police have a double dilemma. On one hand, it is getting more difficult to contain criminals and on the other, members of the public are increasingly taking the law in their own hands, dissatisfied with the pace of police investigations and their inability to curb crime. Mob justice, previously generally moderate, has now taken on grave proportions with suspects facing the risk of being killed if caught. In recent weeks, ten suspects have been stoned and burnt to death by angry mobs, mostly in the high density townships of Lusaka. Police appeals to exercise restraint have gone unheeded. Residents question the logic of staying calm when they are frequently attacked by gangs of robbers, their property stolen, and sometimes their wives and daughters raped.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither have the courts made things easier for the police. Recently a court commissioner ordered the release of suspected car thieves because the prosecutors were taking too long in bringing them to court. On release, two of the suspects reportedly stole cars and went on the run. &quot;Why should we leave such people in the hands of the police,&quot; asks a resident of Chibolya, one of the most crime prone townships of Lusaka. The police concern is that some of the suspects could be innocent, as it turned out in one case when two young men believed to be thieves were almost burnt to death. They survived with severe burn wounds to plead their innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early this year, another spate of mob justice hit the country, especially Lusaka and the tourist capital Livingstone, after children started disappearing. Some of the children were later found, horribly mutilated.  These murders were believed to be ritual killings. Angry mobs again took their justice, beating to death some suspects who the police say were innocent. This ended only when the police arrested and had several men convicted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The euphoria that characterised Zambia's presidential and parliamentary elections five years ago is noticeably absent this time, with less than two months before the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stealing the lime-light is the treason and murder trial of eight members of the main opposition political party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP). Political rallies, which had been gaining in frenzy and frequency, are fizzling out and in their place an air of uncertainty about the holding of elections is creeping in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ex-president Kenneth Kaunda's insistence on contesting the presidency despite being barred constitutionally, is causing anxiety among some politicians who see this as a recipe for conflict that could disrupt the elections. &quot;Whether they (MMD) like it or not, I am standing. No one is going to stop me,&quot; says Dr Kaunda, UNIP leader. The recently passed constitution bars Dr Kaunda from contesting the presidency because one of the qualifications for the position is that both parents of a candidate must be Zambians. Kaunda's parents were Malawians who migrated to Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as we are concerned, Dr Kaunda is our candidate,&quot; says the UNIP's deputy publicity secretary, Pickson Chitambala.&quot; UNIP, which reigned for 27 years before being defeated by the MMD in the 1991 multi-party elections, has since adopted a &quot;no KK, no elections&quot; stance.  (Dr Kaunda is commonly refereed to as KK).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suggestions by some opposition parties to accept the fact that Dr Kaunda is out of the race for presidency and switch their votes to their candidates, has been met with vehemence. The Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC), generally regarded as the third strongest party in the country after the MMD and UNIP, has been calling on UNIP supporters to back the ZDC candidate Dean Mung'omba, but with little success. Mung'omba, a former minister in the MMD government, says that Dr Kaunda and UNIP members should realise their leader's time is up, that it is time to forge ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda's main efforts, after a country wide campaign, are mostly focused on punching holes in the MMD government's performance over the last five years of rule under former trade unionist, Frederick Chiluba. Kaunda always attends the treason trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main thrust of the criticism in recent months has been on the passing of the consitution, allegedly without regard to the views of others, and on the appointment of an Israeli company, Nikuv, to update the voters register.  UNIP and other major opposition parties, including ZDC and the National Party (NP), doubt the impartiality of Nikuv. They believe it was chosen to rig the elections saying that Nikuv operates under the Israeli intelligence organisation, Mossad. UNIP is contesting the appointment of Nikuv in court and, in order not to give credence to the organisation, Dr Kaunda has not registered as a voter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP and the ZDC have also tried to force government to relent on some constitution issues, especially those on elections, by making trips to neighbouring countries to persuade their governments to put political pressure on Zambia. Dr Kaunda is generally better received in countries in the region - Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa - than President Chiluba because of the support Zambia gave to liberation movements when Dr Kaunda was in office. However, the MMD has countered this move by sending its own delegations around the region to assure these neighbours that there is no crisis in Zambia. President Chiluba says that the decision to restrict presidential qualifications was the will of the people and that this was not targeted at Dr Kaunda. He points out that at the time submissions were being made for a review of the constitution, Dr Kaunda had retired from politics.  Zambia, however, still remains uncertain about prospects for peaceful elections given several acts of violence, especially between UNIP and MMD supporters, in some by-elections since 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several non-governmental organisations and the church in Zambia argue that only dialogue, especially between President Chiluba and Dr Kaunda, can ease the tension. The two have agreed to meet, with the announcement coming from South Africa, after a meeting between President Chiluba and the South African leader, Nelson Mandela. The issue of the 'Zambian Crisis' was to have been brought up at a regional heads of state summit meeting in Lesotho but Mr Mandela requested that the matter be discussed behind closed doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the politicians battle for attention, the electorate is - for now - generally paying more attention to the treason and murder trial of the eight men, included being Kaunda's deputy, Chief Inyambo Yetta, and press advisor, Muhabi Lungu. After three weeks of the trial, however, the prosecution has yet to produce concrete proof to link the eight to a spate of bomb blasts, one of which resulted in the death of a bomb disposal expert, Ordon Banda.  The defence team includes all of UNIP's major lawyers (Professor Patrick Mvunga, Mr Sebestian Zulu and Mrs Mwangala Zaloumis) and other prominent lawyers. Their general line of defence has been that the bombs were planted by security men, to implicate their clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next two weeks are bound to produce renewed political excitement as the major political parties are scheduled to officially launch their election campaigns. During this period, Chiluba and Kaunda are expected to meet, but yet again the treason trial is likely to steal the lime-light.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Regional Tourism Organisation for Southern Africa (RETOSA) is to begin operations soon following the collection of the $600,000 (United States dollars) from twelve Southern African Development Commmunity member states in the form of subscriptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian Tourism permanent secretary, Xen Vlahakis, said the national executive committee meeting in Lusaka yesterday at Lilayi Lodge confirmed the decision for member states to pay had been arrived at ministerial level of SADC and would be made available through SADC mechanisms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the critical issue of funding had been overcome and retosa was ready to take off.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that we have the funding issue sorted out we are certain of moving forward,&quot; said mr Vlahakis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of the executive committee, Kananelo Tlebere, who is also managing director of the Lesotho Tourist Board said the meeting mapped out strategies on how best to move forward now that retosa was financilly sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Initially we were supposed to take off on April 1 but funds from member states were released too late and so we were delayed in starting operations,&quot; said Mr Tlebere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A provisional budget covering the period up to 31 March had also been approved by the executive committee meeting which would include the recruitment of a chief executive to be based in Johannesburg, South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation was threatened with collapse if no progress was made in financial contributions from member states who have since paid the $50,000 (United States dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RETOSA was formed to promote tourism destinations in the region as one package and to ease travel of tourists and make the region attractive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RETOSA initiative was aimed at marketing the region and to ensure that destinations were seen as the best to lure tourists. RETOSA also strives to facilitate visitors to the region to have common visas and currency regulations and to see to it that transportation and tourism signs were uniform to ease movement within the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the executive committee who met in Lusaka included representatives from Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lubumbashi - The giant Zairean textile factory in Lubumbashi, Sintexkin, which now imports a total value of 2.5 million U.S. dollars of cotton and spare parts from Zambia annually, is to increase volume of imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copperbelt province deputy minister, Charles Museba, who is attending the 17th session of the Zambia-Zaire regional permanent commission meeting was taken on a conducted tour of the factory today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official of the firm, Jerrard Dounis, said 1.1 million U.S. dollars of the import bill from Zambia was spent on cotton and the remainder on spare parts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the firm was working on a new contract which will increase the volume of imports from Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, the firm exhibited at the Zambia International Trade Fair (ZITF) and won a prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Museba, who was accompanied by Shaba Governor Ngoy Kalume Thade said he was delighted to learn that the firm imported cotton from Zambia to meet the shortfall of the raw material grown locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the potential for trade between the two countries was immense and his office would assist to boost business for mutual benefit of the two sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Mr Museba has urged the Zambia-Zaire regional permanent commission to expedite implementation of its resolutions to save it from becoming moribund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the closure of the 17th session of the Commission in Lubumbashi last night, Mr Museba said the continued carry over of issues would only render the body meaningless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the closure of the meeting was not the end of the important programme of enhancing better understanding between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Museba was, however, happy with the seriousness and frankness with which issues discussed by the commission were approached saying it gave new hopes of scoring success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should always remember that we are people of one family with a common destiny and though we may differ on certain points we should be able to find common solutions to our problems&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the same ceremony, Shaba province acting governor, Mr Thadee assured the Zambian team that his country did not condon banditry and would deal with any one perpetuating the scourge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said everything will be done to ensure that the resolutions of the commission were implemented.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The running programmes were arrived at because of new reforms and the external debt burden which required enhanced donor support to assist in the diversification from the dependency on copper towards sustainable economic foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would require establishment of efficient mobilisation and utilisation of domestic resources.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">threatened to cut economic aid to Zambia if the registration of voters for the 1996 elections was contracted to an Israeli firm, Nikuv.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in an interview with the Zambia News Agency Friday, a spokesman for the U.S Information Center here said that his government only &quot;refused&quot; to fund the registration of voters exercise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The registration of voters by Nikuv has become a controversial issue, with Zambian opposition charging that the firm was hired to help the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy rig the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Defence Minister Ben Mwila revealed on Thursday that both Britain and the U.S. governments had attempted to &quot;black mail&quot; the Zambian government to award registration of voters exercise to their firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwila told students of the university of Zambia that the British firm demanded 22 million U.S.dollars, while the American company wanted 27 million dollars to carry out the exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. government spokesman denied that his government had tried to interfere with the award of the contract.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria - Information ministers of the 113-nation Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) have expressed &quot;deep concern&quot; over the latest United States attacks on member-state, Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a declaration on Friday at the end of their five-day conference in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, the ministers expressed support for Iraq and said the attacks could have &quot;adverse effects&quot; on peace and security in the Gulf region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. carried out two attacks on Iraq this week over the Kurdish problem in northern Iraq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, at the instance of the Malaysian delegation, the NAM ministers observed one minute silence in memory of victims of the U.S. attacks on Iraq.  Several other delegations also spoke on the danger in the escalation of the Gulf crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the NAM ministerial conference in Abuja Tuesday, Iraqi information minister, Ghani Abdul Ghafour, denounced the U.S. attacks as &quot; unprovoked aggression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The declaration also condemned &quot;any political diplomatic, moral or material support to terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It called on the U.S. &quot;to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial measures that intensified the embargo on Cuba,&quot; another NAM member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington was also urged to end its &quot;aggressive radio and TV transmission against Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution expressed &quot;solidarity with Libya,&quot; and reaffirmed the NAM ministers support for the &quot;legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people to secure their inalienable rights to self-determination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers called for the &quot;withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian and Arab lands including Jerusalem, Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon, based on the relevant U.N. resolutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also supported the efforts of the two Koreans for unification.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the demise of communism and the collapse of the former Soviet Union, NAM members believe the challenges posed by a unipolar world make the organization not only relevant but also unassailable in its protection and popularization of the principles under which it was founded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's soccer star, Kanu Nwankwo, has vowed to continue his football career in spite of a heart problem diagnosed by doctors early this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My sporting career is not finished,&quot; he said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu, 20, who reportedly failed a second test on his left aorta valve on Wednesday, said he would do everything to ensure that his career was not terminated by this cardiac condition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a reported telephone conversation Thursday with Sanni Toro, the secretary general of the Nigerian Football Federation, Kanu spoke of plans for him to undergo another test in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will go to the best specialists in the world in order to play again,&quot; Kanu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gangling striker who contributed to the two European Cup victories of Ajax FC of Amsterdam, and spearheaded Nigeria's Olympic soccer gold medal in Atlanta, United States, said it was hard to describe the nightmare he had endured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged concerned folk back home to remain calm. He said he plans to lace his boots for the play-offs for the next world cup in France in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors at the Italian club, Inter Milan FC, announced early this week that Kanu, skipper of Nigeria's under-23 Olympic squad, had a weak aorta valve which could prove fatal if he did not quit soccer for good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FIFA, the world soccer governing body, reacted by forwarding the report of the test to its medical committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The test reportedly showed the ailment in Kanu who in July moved from Ajax Amsterdam to Inter Milan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ajax Amsterdam officials have since denied that they covered up the cardiac problem in the player throughout his stay with the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Nigeria's sports minister, Jim Nwobodo, said Thursday that Kanu's situation was not as serious as reported by the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said on state television that he was personally in touch with Kanu and had assured him of a place in Nigeria's first match against Burkina Faso in the world cup qualifying series in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian Football Association has reportedly sent its medical adviser to the Italian club to obtain first-hand information on Kanu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian Cardiac Association has offered assistance in diagnosing and managing Kanu's condition if he is brought home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, proprietor of Iwuanyanwu Nationale Football Club where Kanu began his career, appealed Thursday to government to endeavour to secure expert medical investigation of Kanu's ailment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, the Nigerian government said it would foot the medical bills for any treatment the soccer star would be given.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria has decided to close its diplomatic mission in Canada, citing budget constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nigerian economy can no longer sustain the maintenance of a large number of diplomatic missions and personnel abroad. It is in this context that government has decided to close down its diplomatic mission in Canada,&quot; the foreign ministry said in a statement issued here Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This closure of our mission is, however, without prejudice to existing relations, agreements or ongoing programmes between Nigeria and Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada, a member of the eight-nation Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), in August announced unilateral sanctions against the Nigerian military government, accusing it of widespread human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its August meeting in London, the group decided to postpone a human rights fact-finding mission to Nigeria, saying senior officials would visit the country to discuss with the military government the &quot;modalities&quot; for the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group at the same time deferred a decision to impose sanctions on Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But canada went ahead and imposed unilateral sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefing the diplomats last week in Abuja, Nigeria's foreign minister, Tom Ikimi, in a clear reference to Canada, said that it was &quot;unfortunate that a member of the CGAM broke away from the commonwealth consensus and decided to impose sanctions against Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts here see Nigeria's decision to close its mission in Canada as a response to the country's action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria was suspended from the commonwealth in reaction to the execution in november, 1995 of nine Ogoni minority rights activists including the author, Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has persistently told the commonwealth that the suspension of the country was unjust and unfounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts also see the unilateral imposition of sanctions by Canada as a move to convince other members of the commonwealth to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CMAG is made up of the foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINGSTON, Jamaica - The Rastafarian movement in Jamaica has urged Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to extradite former Ethiopian dictator, Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, to stand trial for genocide in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We appreciate your giving Mengistu asylum but time has now come to hand him over to Ethiopia for trial,&quot; a member of the movement said Thursday during a courtesy call on Mugabe, who is in Jamaica on a four-day state visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mengistu and his family were granted asylum in Zimbabwe in 1991 after fleeing from Ethiopia as guerrilla armies opposed to his regime closed in on the capital, Addis Ababa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and a group army officers in 1974 overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie and are suspected of having later killed the frail emperor. Thousands of other Ethiopians were also eliminated by the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior officials of the military junta, called the DERG, are currently being tried in Ethiopia for genocide and crimes against humanity. Mengistu is being tried in absentia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rastafarians believe the emperor was God and derive the name of their faith from Rastafar, Selassie's name before he assumed the throne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have also condemned atrocities committed in other African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the meeting with Mugabe, the Rastafarian movement and the Universal Negro Movement Association, formed by the late Jamaican black nationalist, Marcus Garvey, spoke of the need for repatriation of Jamaicans to Zimbabwe and other African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They asked Mugabe to offer some land so they could &quot;go back home&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said not all Jamaicans could desert the country they fought for, as it would fall in the hands of the whites again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Organisation of African Unity should discuss the issue of offering land to those who wanted to be repatriated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said there was need for the formation of a pan-African movement to unite all Africans in and outside the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is need for us to have a pan-African organisation to promote pan- Africanism which was preached by Marcus Garvey, whose aim was to unite all black men, wherever he is,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe paid tribute to Jamaicans for their support during Zimbabwe's war of liberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the members of the Rastafarian movement and Universal Negro Improvement Association that Zimbabwe was their second home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are fully aware that you were behind us in our struggle for independence. I would like to thank the people of Jamaica and Black Americans for your support, political, moral, material and financial. We are grateful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The liberation of Africans is the liberation of the people in and outside the continent. Thank you for your support and now you have a second home - come home. Africa is also your home, it cannot be my home alone,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe was later conferred with Jamaica's highest honor, the Order of Jamaica, in recognition of his relentless fight against apartheid in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous recipients of the award include South African president Nelson Mandela, Cuban president Fidel Castro and the late renowned reggae star Bob Marley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting the award, Jamaican Governor-General, Sir Howard Cooke, praised the president for his commitment to the fight for black rule in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Percival Patterson hailed Mugabe's relentless struggle against apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patterson acknowledged Mugabe's performance as head of the non-aligned movement, commonwealth, frontline states and the current chairmanship of the World Solar Summit to be held in Zimbabwe Sept. 16 and 17.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg -The town of Bailundo, set in the , farmlands of central Huambo, has always played a significant role in Angolan history. Once home to the Ovimbundu kings, famous for leading a 1902 rebellion against Portuguese rule, the town is now home to a different ruler. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi turned the town into the new headquarters for the Uniaco Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (Unita) in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last month the third extraordinary congress of Unita, now celebrating 30 years of resistance to Portuguese and Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA) rule, was held amid the mix of renovated and shell-damaged buildings of Bailundo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the town centre, the city hall was draped with red and green flags sporting the symbolic black cockerel crowing at dawn. Inside, the walls were plastered with paintings of Unita's African heroes Nelson Mandela, Kwame Nkrumah, Gamal Nasser and many more lined the entry to the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when Savimbi arrived at the congress venue, the music of Jean Michel Jarre filled the air. The town's new king looked healthy and young, his cropped head neatly clipped with not a grey hair in sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media are keen to discover why there have been interminable delays in cementing a peace accord for the country. The latest is due to Savimbi's rejection of the vice presidency, a post he had agreed to accept until recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent demand that a senior Unita staffer fill the post came as a surprise to all at the United Nations, the Troika (Russia, America and Portugal) and the MPLA. Savimbi added at the congress that the integration of the rival parties' armed forces, delayed by security problems, and the MPLA's use of mercenaries, are other factors stalling the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unita is now insisting that all 40 generals in its high command be integrated into the MPLA's Angolan Armed Forces a move possibly designed to quell growing discontent in Unita's military ranks as officers demand the same treatment as the movement's political leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the generals, recently promoted by Unita, have allegedly been responsible for major human rights atrocities in Angola. The move is possibly designed to obtain a guarantee of safety from the MPLA and the United Nations so that these people can effectively be indemnified against punishment for war crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPLA announced recently in Luanda a general amnesty for all war crimes committed since 1992, but few in the Unita ranks believe this will come about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congress made it obvious that Unita has little intention of returning now or soon to Luanda. Savimbi insisted he wanted to remain president of Unita, a post he would have to relinquish if he became deputy president of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Bailundo he makes endless demands that will continue to paralyse the Angolan government and economy. With his militia and civilian supporters being accommodated by the United Nations, the status quo can continue indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has also played an important role in the supply of logistics to Unita's quartering areas, through recent multi-million dollar donations. An estimated $30-million a month from diamond revenue is also making Unita a profitable venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A party celebrating Unita's success at the end of the congress perhaps reflected the new fortunes of Unita's leaders, who entertained congress members with imported French champagne and wine, Schol beer made under licence in Zaire and whisky from the heartlands of Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A block away from the congress hall, lay the reality of Unita. Heavily armed commandos patrolled the streets with the familiar and dreaded red berets on their heads, as ominous reminders that the movement's special forces are far from being quartered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the town a silence prevails. People talk in whispers, no one laughs out loud, the streets are full of people but empty of voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to interview or meet locals from Bailundo are totally out of the question. They scamper away at the sight of journalists. The eyes of Unita officials fill with fear when reasonable questions are asked. Asking questions is the task of only senior people, who also prefer to answer questions with questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A press conference held by Savimbi on the last day after the congress reflected the movement's ongoing xenophobia. The first critical question directed at Savimbi erupted into loud jeers and booing from the audience. The bemused Portuguese journalist glanced back into a sea of angry faces and sat down. But there was no mercy and he was called on again to repeat his question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was not the time or the place to ask questions on past human rights violations, the war against ordinary Angolans or the nine-month siege of Quito which forced its dehumanised people to eat dogs and the bodies of the dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the fate of South African mercenaries captured and held, Savimbi suggested &quot;the question be put to the MPLA who employed them&quot;. But the fate of these men now seems evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The South Africans ... captured by Unita?&quot; asks General Arlindo Pena known as &quot;Ben Ben&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are not here ... they are dead ... If they were captured on the front line ... then they were executed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General!&quot; a journalist insists, &quot;There are South African families who believe the men are still held by Unita.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no one here. We would present them. They are not alive ... they are dead. If they were caught in the front line ...&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General, what is the message I tell the mothers, the wives?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tell them ... we are not sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treatment meted out to the four South Africans captured while mining for diamonds and held at Bailundo for nine months, leaves little hope of survival for the men who have been missing since mid-1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four were tortured for months on end. Bags were placed over their heads so that they did not know where or when the beatings would start or where the punches were coming from. Their thumbs were tied over their shoulders, and their arms stretched for days on end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And mercenaries employed by Unita, general?&quot; the journalist asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have none.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Burundi's Tutsi-dominated military regime was grappling with renewed Hutu rebel attacks on the capital this week as the country's largest political party threw its support behind the insurgents in a struggle it compared to black South Africans' fight against apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours of the announcement the army said rebels had launched a fresh attack near the capital, Bujumbura, which was shaken by mortars and gunfire on Tuesday night. Fighting was also continuing in the north of the country where guerrillas are trying to cut access to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A United States military transport plane evacuated some embassy staff and other expatriates from Bujumbura on Wednesday, but American officials said the aircraft had been scheduled before the latest rebel assault. It was expected to be the last such flight for some time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exiled parliamentarians of the mainly Hutu Front for Democracy in Burundi (Frodebu) have come out publicly in support of the rebel cause saying that since the military overthrew civilian government in July, and banned political parties, there is no choice but to fight. A representative in Nairobi, Joseph Ntakirutimana, said they had given their backing to the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), a splinter group from Frodebu launched after Tutsi soldiers murdered Burundi's first elected and Hutu president three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From now on we are together with the CNDD. We are going to reinforce them because we have the same enemy the Tutsi army,&quot; Ntakirutimana said. &quot;We are fighting a minority system in Burundi similar to what the blacks were fighting in South Africa and it is important that we stand united, we wage the resistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other prominent Frodebu politicians are still sheltering at various foreign embassies in Bujumbura. They include Burundi's deposed president, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who has been a not altogether welcome guest at the US ambassador's residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frodebu's announcement came shortly before renewed rebel attacks around the capital. The army used helicopter gunships and mortars to battle rebels in fresh fighting a day after insurgents dropped mortars on Bujumbura and fired automatic rifles from surrounding hills. An army spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Isaie Nibizi, said the latest clashes were on the eastern outskirts of the city which was ethnically cleansed of most Hutus by the military last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CNDD said the attacks, the most serious on the capital since the coup, are a warning to the army that the rebels can descend from the hills at any time. Although the military tried to play down the significance of the attack by saying there were no deaths and no real damage, the rebels added to the psychological pressure on a city without electricity after rebels sabotaged power lines , and which is also suffering severe fuel shortages because of a regional economic blockade in protest at the coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frodebu's backing for the rebels is a blow to attempts by Burundi's military leader, Major Pierre Boyoya, to isolate the insurgents and win the endorsement of prominent Hutu politicians by promising an ordered transition to a stable democracy and to impose greater discipline on an army heavily implicated in atrocities against Hutu civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frodebu won the presidency and the overwhelming majority of seats in Parliament in the 1993 elections, which much of the Hutu majority viewed as a liberation from Tutsi minority domination akin to the downfall of white rule in South Africa the following year. But after President Melchior Ndadaye's assassination in 1993, Frodebu's power was rapidly eroded by the army and Tutsi establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Tanzanian president, Julius Nyerere, who has been mediating in Burundi's crisis, this week held out the possibility sanctions might be relaxed if Buyoya began a serious dialogue with Hutu opponents, including the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere said the talks are more important than other demands by regional leaders for the restoration of constitutional rule, Parliament and political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Buyoya has so far stood by his insistence that there can be no negotiations until the rebels lay down their weapons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The President of Swaziland's People's United Democratic Movement (Puderno) has withdrawn from a committee set up to write the country's Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mario Masuku listed seven demands to be met among them the lifting of a 1973 decree which bans political parties from operating in Swaziland before he would rejoin the talks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existence of Puderno is currently illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee met for the first time last week to map a programme of action according to terms of reference set out by Attorney General Sipho Zwane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee has been given enormous powers to prosecute anyone who dares to &quot;belittle&quot; or &quot;insult&quot; it including the authority to impose fines of E5 000 (R5 000) or five years' imprisonment or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swaziland Democratic Alliance (SDA), a group of political organisations, trade unions and other civic groups advocating for change, has said the law is meant to intimidate people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SDA Secretary General Jerry Nxumalo said: &quot;People will now be afraid to submit to the committee because of this threat. You will never know what will insult the commissioners, so it will be better not to say anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Jerry Gule, secretary general of the Institute for Democracy and Leadership (Ideal), and also a member of the commission, also expressed his dissatisfaction in the way that the terms of reference were drawn up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ideal feels that the approach being adopted by those so far who have been handling the process is creating unnecessary stumbling blocks. For the process to be transparent and legitimate the views of all the stakeholders in and outside the commission should be accommodated,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-person team, announced by King Mswati III in July, was given two years to draw up a Constitution for Swaziland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Although Zimbabwe's strike by civil servants has been suspended, the threat of renewed labour unrest continues.  The strikers have given the government until September 27 to address problems Plain English which lead to their strike which lasted nearly four weeks the most widescale and costly labour unrest since independence in 1980.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the strike (which economists say cost the country the equivalent of at least R500-million) was at its height, President Robert Mugabe and several of his ministers were out of the country. Dr Edmore Kambudzi, a political scientist at the University of Zimbabwe, said Mugabe felt secure enough to leave at such a critical time because &quot;he has a lot of dead wood at the top, hangers-on whose job it is to make sure Mugabe stays in power. These people control the army and the police.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe displayed his ignorance of the reasons for the strike when he returned home after his Cape Town honeymoon: &quot;I don't understand why the strike is on at all. Government never knew there was a grievance. Those who are striking never told us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lower civil servants, many of whom live far below the bread line, got an average 3% increase just before the strike, while Cabinet ministers, permanent secretaries and their deputies and others got an average 45% increase as well as other perks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike has further dented Mugabe's popularity in Zimbabwe, with foreign donors, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kambudzi explained this by saying: &quot;Mugabe has indicated he may resign before the next presidential elections, so he does not care anymore about serious national problems even though he is doing great harm to the nation.  It will take years to recover from Mugabe's mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - While Pagad is baying for quick justice from blood-stained streets, the police at head office are scrabbling for money to buy a fingerprinting system which would remove one of the key blockages in the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purchase of an automated fingerprint system Afis would speed up police investigations and court trials by up to two months. But the system would cost about R200-million and the police do not, to date, have the money for it in their budget, although it is listed as a priority in draft strategy documents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, their manual fingerprinting service is buckling under the strain of increased crime, arrests and criminal trials: so much so that earlier this year, the police sent letters to attorneys general apologising for delays and explaining the problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter indicates the police are receiving 3 000 new sets of fingerprints daily for processing,. Of all the fingerprint queries it receives, the police say 72% take 20 days to process, 21% take 40 days and 8% take 80 days. Not only are fingerprint checks essential in police investigations, but they are also neccessary in criminal trials where the harshness of sentence is relative to the number of previous convictions of the accused. In magistrate's courts, particularly, sentencing is delayed as fingerprints are checked, with the accused either having to apply for bail or spend up to two months in prison until the records are found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police have almost five million sets of prints in their records to sift through by hand. Afis would cut down the two-month delays to half an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Home Affairs is to tender for an Afis system in November, but this system will not be shared by the police who will have to get their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police representative said the police were also looking at a system where people could be identified by their retina by using a computerised eye-scan for criminals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa won gold at the Olympics and the Paralympics, but there is no medal for our latest title, nor a podium for the proud winner: Nuno Gomes, Deepest Diver in the World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just back from the dolomite crags of Bushmansgat near the Botswana border, he dived to 283,3m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While computerised depth monitors lose accuracy the deeper one goes, the lead-weighted line is a failsafe record. And if anyone walking past Johannesburg's Linksfield Park wondered what two men were doing with a very, very long piece of blue and white ski rope stretched across the field and back last Sunday, it was Nuno Gomes and son Nuno, measuring the record again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes said: &quot;We couldn't lay the rope out flat at Bushmansgat. In Johannesburg we laid it out straight and used a steel surveyor's tape. The figure was 283,3m.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous world record holder, American Jim Bowden, aged 55, plumbed a depth of 281,9m in Mexico's Zacaton cave, so a small difference is vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes, a civil engineer with the Department of Transport, says that if one really wants to compare like with like, the Bushmansgat dive is far more difficult than the two alternative sites: Vacluse in France or the Mexican cave, because they are both close to sea level. But for him the real achievement is being the first to reach the bottom of Bushmansgat ... and survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says: &quot;No one can ever beat that. It's like being the first man to climb Everest. Who ever remembers the second person to get there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the record is solo, the dive was a team event. Gomes has visited the black cavern regularly since 1988, but this latest trip involved seven vital support divers: Craig Newham, 31, computer scientist; Liz Gomes, 42, town planner; Theo van Eerden, 43, police diver; Lionel Brink, 30, computer scientist; Joseph Emmanuel, 29, computer scientist; Craig Kahn, 32, patent lawyer, and Shaun French, 26, a former navy diver and now a paramedic with Medical Rescue International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes himself is 44. He is ecstatic at his success but says: &quot;I will never go again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The physical and psychological stress are simply too much. But probably more important than that is the cost: sponsorship just for gas, valves and batteries on this latest trip was valued at more than R20 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loan of other essential equipment including two compressors and a medical rescue organisation seconding a fully qualified paramedic who was expert at dealing with decompression sickness, Gomes said was &quot;beyond value&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took a week to set up the dive, getting acclimatised to the water and to the inevitable nitrogen narcosis (over-inhalation of nitrogen). Gomes and his teammates dived to 60m, placing cables and cylinders in position. Trailer- loads of equipment had to be sorted, gases mixed and cylinders filled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a previous attempt at the record, Gomes had to stop because he would not have had enough gas for the return to the surface. This time nothing was left to chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had swapped his training location from the murky shallow waters of Johannesburg's Emmarentia Dam for the deeper Bass Lake at Henley-on-Klip. &quot;I practised for hour upon hour, swimming with the huge set of cylinders.&quot; At Bushmansgat, Gomes entered the water wearing seven cylinders that weighed more than he did; two of 18 litres, two of 14 litres, two of 10 litres and one of 4 litres. Attached to these were R10 000 worth of &quot;demand valves&quot;, each taped so that nothing like algae would get into them. Gomes sank swiftly through the sink hole at the bottom of the un-named lake at Bushmansgat into the top of the cavern 51,8m below the surface. From there he plummeted feet first for 15 minutes from the time he left the surface, then turned into a landing position head first and he found himself almost face down in silt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes said: &quot;All our earlier measurements had led me to expect the cave to be deeper than it was. But suddenly the floor of the cave was looming towards me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a cluster of torches under water, it is difficult to see far in the darkness. Gomes managed to avoid landing on a ledge in the cavern, &quot;but I approached the silt like a sky diver&quot;! The silt is as fine as talcum powder and of uncertain depth and divers try to avoid it. But Gomes hit the silt earlier than he had expected and got stuck in the grey powder which remains suspended in the water for hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He couldn't see and he was shivering from the effects of the gases, particularly helium and nitrogen. &quot;I was trying to balance myself on my feet, but I was under quite a lot of nitrogen narcosis and had helium tremors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was little time to think. His lungs were full of carbon dioxide and it was vital to get off the bottom with the minimum of exertion. &quot;It took a long time to inflate my buoyancy compensators because the gas was dense and could not flow easily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Gomes scanned the cave floor, there was no sign of cylinders dropped by earlier divers. Nor could he see any trace of Dion Dreyer, the 21-year-old diver who died in the cave a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two minutes later he was on the return route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two people have died at Bushmansgat. They recovered one body in 1993 but Dreyer's has never been found. All that was found by a remotely operated submersible that was used to search the cavern floor were blind catfish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes took more than 12 hours to return to surface. He started decompressing at 160m in a careful computer-calculated decompression schedule.  From 80m upwards he had shrimps and then frogs for company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reached the surface at night, with no ill effects other than a puffed up face where his skin had been in contact with the water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he rested, he knew he was lucky. Most other divers have died or been partially paralysed in the quest for the deepest depth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes has achieved the deepest dive in sea, cave or lake without the use of a diving bell. He said: &quot;I didn't want to sit down at 60 and look back at life, thinking that I could have and should have done this dive. For me it was reaching a point where nobody has ever been before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will continue to play underwater hockey and to head the Transvaal Spearfishing Team. And he will back at work at the Department of Transport.  But what goal will he set himself next?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I'll look for a nice shipwreck in the records, somewhere off the Mozambique coast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may find his gold medal yet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - They'll be on opposing sides in the Land Claims Court (LCC) in October, but Basil Davidson and Anwar Nagia agree on a fundamental issue: the Restitution of Land Rights Act of 1994 is flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davidson, chief executive officer of the Cape Town Community Land Trust overseeing the rebuilding of District Six, supports a June application in terms of Section 34 of the Act, under which restitution can be refused if it is in &quot;the public interest&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it succeeds, vacant land in District Six will not be restored to claimants who have applied to the Land Claims Commissioner, but will be redeveloped by the trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application is being brought by the owners of the land, the city of Cape Town and the provincial government. They are paying the legal costs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nagia, chair of the District Six Residents' Association (DSRA), is opposing the application on the grounds that it is expropriation in a different guise, and will further traumatise victims of forced removals. He wants District Six claimants to be allowed to submit individual claims and to be awarded compensation. They can cede their rights to the trust if they wish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davidson is motivated by practical considerations. The trust aims to house 4 000 families in an integrated development on the cusp of the CBD. If Cape Town is in the running for the 2004 Olympics, the building of sports venues will start soon and they would prefer the development to start before building costs rocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is no Section 34 application, land will only be returned to the small minority of landowners and not to the tenants who made up the bulk of the population of District Six before the forced removals,&quot; said Davidson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not denying anyone their rights to claim for restitution, but redevelopment offers a broader benefit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were about 71 000 people living in District Six when it was declared a white area in 1966. The government expropriated 2 375 properties, of which 66% were owned by white absentee landlords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, more than half of the land has been sold and developed. Of the restitution claims already lodged, 28% is for land under existing roads, 18% for land developed by the Cape Technikon, 13% lies under homes erected after the area was declared white and 41% is for vacant land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should the trust redevelop District Six, most claimants would benefit from revenues raised from what is built. The LCC has the authority to grant claimants alternative land if theirs is not available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An underlying problem with District Six is a bigger problem with the Act itself,&quot; said Davidson. &quot;The original Act was drafted for application in rural areas and the drafters tacked on clauses relating to urban Group Areas Act removals without thinking through the procedures. I predict that Cato Manor in Durban will experience the same problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If claimants become more realistic, we can get more participation in the planning of redevelopment. We don't want to ride roughshod over anyone, but we have to start moving soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no alternative to the Section 34 application. It is the only way to make it possible for more of the former tenants to move back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nagia believes there has to be an alternative. He says the Section 34 application has stripped individuals of their rights and made them &quot;ashamed&quot; of pursuing their rightful claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DSRA has been a leading light in the struggle to reclaim District Six.  It was central in the campaign to halt development for white residents in the 1980s, it battled to rename the area District Six after the government changed it to Zonnebloem and it marched on private companies intent on developing the area and forced them to abandon their plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When negotiations started we were told the ANC was fighting for equitable redistribution of land.&quot; But, said Nagia, &quot;We were tricked. Section 34 ...  smacks of the same tactics the government and the council used when they declared District Six white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We represent a wounded community. In the interest of greater participation therapy if you like claimants should be allowed to lodge individual claims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DSRA has held three public meetings since the application was filed in June and has secured power of attorney from 999 former District Six residents to oppose the court action. The organisation has withdrawn its participation from the District Six Development Forum, established by the trust to oversee the planning process for the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nagia is incensed that the trust has chosen to fight the matter in court.  The costs of the application will be paid by the central substructure of Cape Town and the provincial government. Jeremy Gauntlett, SC, will represent them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we want to oppose this matter successfully,&quot; said Nagia, &quot;we will also have to brief a senior advocate and we estimate the legal costs will amount to R300 000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter will probably be heard in October. Davidson is hoping to start planning the new District Six. Nagia is determined to stop him. &quot;If the redevelopment does not have the support of 100% of the claimants, then District Six will remain barren,&quot; he vowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Live And Die In District Six (Sidebar)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebrahim Jacobs says his heart belongs in District Six, and he supports the application to the Land Claims Court because it offers the best opportunity for tenants to return to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs's family was among the last to leave District Six. They were kicked out in 1981 after alternative housing was built for them in Lentegeur, Mitchells Plain more than 25km from the city centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lodged a claim this year with the regional land claims commission on behalf of his parents, who were both born in District Six and had hoped to die there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs is the secretary of an organisation called Concerned Ex-Residents of District Six which represents 900 ex-residents and is part of the District Six Development Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His grandparents, father and mother were born in District Six, and his parents raised their nine children in a three-bedroomed terraced home they rented in Upper Ashley Street. The house survived the demolition of the area, but the street has been renamed Blinders Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not expecting to get our old house back, we know that's not possible, but my parents want to move back to the area at least,&quot; said Jacobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the Jacobs children went to school in District Six, and when the family was moved to Lentegeur, they made a daily trek to school each day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were never happy in Lentegeur. The only good thing about the move was that the families from District Six were all moved together and so neighbours could stay in touch with each other,&quot; Jacobs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the children grew up without the same kind of community spirit there was in District Six and today the area is plagued with gangsterism and crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My family has never felt settled in Mitchells Plain and so when the opportunity arose to claim back our right to District Six, we made sure our claim was lodged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs said his parents had been tenants for all of their lives and would now have purchase a new home in the redeveloped District Six. Their nine children are all committed to assisting financially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My brothers, sisters and I would also love to move back, but we know that won't be possible. My heart is in District Six but the pain of leaving will be eased if at least my parents get the right to live there again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was very frustrating that the redevelopment was now delayed by the District Six Residents Association's opposition to the Section 34 application.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African Broadcasting Corporation journalists, along with about 250 of their colleagues from around the world, were holed up in a compound in Libya this week, unsure when they would be allowed to leave the country to return to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Current Affairs Executive Producer Freek Robinson, a producer, Kotie van Heerden, a cameraman, Trevor Pistorius, and a number of journalists from SABC's external radio station, Channel Africa, had travelled to Libya for the Libyan Independence Day Celebrations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had the explicit assurance of the Libyan ambassador who promised everything would go smoothly and who also promised an interview with his leader, General Gadaffi,&quot; he said, &quot;but that fell through&quot;. Robinson confessed to being a little worried about his staff, but said he was comforted by the fact that the Libyans were anxious to promote a good relationship with South Africa. &quot;All the journalists who were there were kept in a compound and strictly monitored The intelligent and they were dependent on the goodwill of the Libyan government to get to the nearest international airport to catch their flights home and that is seven hours away in Tunisia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the Libyan government is making it as difficult as possible so they can make a point that Libyans are suffering because of the ban on international flights to and out of Libya,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journalists were expected to catch a plane to Europe on Thursday and then fly back to Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Independent Catholic church schools which cater for thousands of disadvantaged black schoolchildren will be the first to suffer in the wake of cutbacks in their subsidies by the Gauteng Education Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious and independent schools in Gauteng have been plunged into a crisis by the province's Education Department's sudden announcement of a retrospective 30% cut in their subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since schools get paid their subsidies in four stages during the year, the two remaining pay-outs in September and December will be down-scaled accordingly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six independent Catholic schools are under threat of closure unless a rapid solution can be found to their financial woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the 30% cut remains the same for all schools, the actual value of the cut varies according to the size of schools' individual budgets.  Immaculata High School in Diepkloof, Soweto, for example, will lose R605 000 in the cut, while the Holy Family Convent in Parktown will lose R250 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gauteng's Catholic Education Negotiating Team (Cent) said it had been led to understand an adequate notice of a subsidy cut would be given, to allow schools to plan accordingly. &quot;Coming as it does in the third quarter of the academic year, this makes it almost impossible for schools to adjust their budgets. With a further cut looming in 1997, many schools which serve the poorer black communities will be unlikely to survive,&quot; a Cent spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The schools that are the least likely to survive are those which provide education to black children from disadvantaged communities whose parents cannot afford to pay drastically increased fees. At least four schools in Soweto are under threat of closure within the next year or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these Catholic schools rely heavily on their subsidies from the Gauteng Education Department, in order to make them more accessible to the black community. Cent feels the Gauteng provincial government has no clear policy and has made no attempt to distinguish between elite schools, like St John's College or Roedean in Johannesburg which can better absorb this cut and genuinely deserving cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng MEC for Education Mary Metcalf contends that her department has suffered a budget cut for the 1995/96 financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, Metcalf argues, is there are a greater number of private schools, both church and independent, competing for a slice from a shrinking pie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are short-term options available to private schools facing the crunch this year, according to Metcalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can take their first subsidy for next year this year, or they can convert to a state school. The legal mechanisms are in place for them to change into a public school at their request.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, she says: &quot;If private schools do want to become a public school ...  the ethos of the school will have to be determined by the community. They cannot retain their Catholic ethos unless it is the democratic choice of the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cent claims, however, that the Education Department has already turned down one such request on the grounds that it does not have sufficient funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is possible that a more satisfactory settlement could be worked out in time,&quot; a Cent spokesman said, &quot;but for many of our schools, there is no time.&quot; 'For many of our schools, there is no time'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - African National Congress chairman Jacob Zuma is emerging as a strong contender for the position of deputy president of the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela's announcement that he would step down as ANC president at the organisation's conference in December 1997, and as the country's president in 1999, has paved the way for Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to take over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is broad acceptance of this: in terms of experience and seniority in the ANC, Mbeki stands head and shoulders above any other candidate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only has he been anointed by Mandela as his heir, but his election as deputy ANC president in 1994 made it clear the job was his: in terms of ANC tradition, the deputy president has always become president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it does not follow that whoever becomes deputy ANC president will also become the country's deputy president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a start, it would undermine Mbeki's constitutional prerogative, as president, to choose his own deputy from the ranks of members of the national assembly. It is also unlikely that anyone ambitious enough to want the position would be content to remain in it until Mbeki completed what could be a lengthy term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Mbeki may want flexibility in his choice. If his deputy is there by his own choice, it would be easier for him to effect a reshuffle, in consultation with members of Cabinet, than it would be if the deputy were effectively elected by the ANC conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A scenario under discussion in the upper echelons of the ANC is that it would make sense for Zuma, if elected deputy president, to remain at his KwaZulu- Natal base. Having the former ANC intelligence chief there would be important to counter the impact of Inkatha Freedom Party Chief Mangosuthu Buthlezi actually carrying out his threat of leaving the government of national unity and returning to lead the province. Zuma's elevation within the ANC would also assist him in any contest with Buthelezi for the premiership. In terms of experience and seniority, Zuma would carry the support of large sections of the ANC. If he were to stand, other contenders could see the battle as already won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More pressing for the ANC at present is finding a new secretary general to replace Cyril Ramaphosa. Cheryl Carolus, elected to the position of deputy secretary general at the ANC's 1994 conference, is said to be Mandela's favourite for the post but is understood to be reluctant to take it on if she cannot count on the full support of national and provincial structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It emerged this week that top-level discussions are under way around redeploying some ANC MPs to the national office to provide her with the full- time back-up she needs. If this comes about it is possible that the National Executive Committee will appoint her as secretary general to run the organisation until fresh elections are held at conference in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the National Union of Mineworkers has indicated that it is not prepared at present to release its leader, Kgalema Motlanthe, for the position, this could have changed by the time conference comes around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential aide Joel Netshitenzhe has declined to make himself available for the post. A firm favourite with the ANC Youth League, it is understood he prefers not to abandon ship until Mandela's term ends.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - State-sponsored gangs, who used government patronage to build criminal business empires, featured prominently during Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) sittings in Mpumalanga this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although state support for the thugs officially ended with the dissolution of the security branch in the late 1980s, the commission believes the gangs are alive and still enjoying protection from former security branch members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRC co-chairman Alex Boraine said potential witnesses were so afraid to testify about the gangs that additional police protection had to be arranged at the hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga police superintendent John Nkuna, who was seconded to the TRC in order to oversee the protection of witnesses, refused to comment on investigations into the gangs. He was afraid they would &quot;target me&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in this region are terrified of two groups called Kabasa and Sibaya Esikhulu, who have earned a reputation for assassinating you in some brutal manner if you oppose their interests,&quot; explained provincial Safety and Security MEC Steve Mabona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both these 'businessmen's gangs' and another similar gang in Ermelo, called the Black Cats, are currently being investigated by my special investigation's unit,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Cats gang was the focus of a Goldstone Commission inquiry in 1992 after the Mail &amp; Guardian disclosed that its members had been trained by Inkatha paramilitary fighters to harass African National Congress members in townships around Ermelo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona said Kabasa, which operates around Nelspruit, had adopted its name from Soweto tsotsis who attacked homes and gang-raped girls. He added that the gangs had extensive links with conservative elements in the police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They believe that they're the township untouchables and are primarily criminal in their activities. Kabasa and especially Sibaya Esikhulu (Big Kraal) are extremely well organised,&quot; added Mabona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabasa was formed in 1986 to fight members of the Leaks Youth Movement (Leyomo), supporters of the ANC-aligned United Democratic Front. The gang was run by five heavy-weight black businessmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two gang members, including alleged leader Ex Mkhatshwa, were murdered by unidentified attackers after at least seven ANC youths were killed by the gang during ambushes in KaNyamazane township near Nelspruit. Mkhatshwa was shot dead in 1988, while another member, Lucky Nsimbini, was forced to swallow petrol before being covered with cardboard boxes, doused in fuel and burnt alive. The three surviving gang members apparently still terrorise businessmen, no longer for political gains but to eliminate any business competition in their territory around Nelspruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently two of the alleged members of the gang, Solly &quot;Mabhubesi&quot; Sifunda and P Malumana, appeared in the Nelspruit Magistrate's Court in connection with the murder of an ANC activist from Soweto and a Mozambican citizen in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Tsotsetsi and Mozambican Kenneth Maphemas were killed on separate occasions, but in the same execution manner their hands and feet were tied before three truck tyres were placed around their bodies and set alight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a special court sitting on a Saturday morning, the men were released on R1 000 bail each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigating the case is the head of the Mpumalanga special investigation unit, Captain Fanie Molapo, who played a leading role during recent investigations into third force operations in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the dedication of some investigators, Mabona's greatest concern is the ongoing police protection the gangs still seem to enjoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although declining to give names, he charged that on a number of occasions senior officers totally unconnected with the relevant investigation had stepped in after the arrest of gang members and had ordered all charges be dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are parts of the police which are horribly corrupt. Senior officers interfere in cases they should have no interest in and even travel 200km from Middelburg to Nelspruit to ensure charges are dropped,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just last week, the special unit arrested a hitman in KwaZulu-Natal who is used by Mpumalanga businessmen. A senior officer managed to get the man out on bail on a small charge after he was initially denied bail on 10 counts of murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona also expressed his concern that despite almost 100 cases linking policemen to the Black Cats gang, the investigation had apparently been frozen by its new police supervisor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Kabasa member testified before the TRC, although one gang member, who started a church and declared himself a preacher, claimed during a service two weeks ago that he would use the commission to clear his name.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - At this week's Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) hearings in Johannesburg, everybody wanted to appear historically disadvantaged. However, at least some of their dreams of tragic heroism were a little far-fetched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three consortiums bidding for Highveld Stereo, the plumpest slice of regional radio currently being auctioned by the SABC, were throwing a lot of cash around. We're talking big bucks here: hundereds of millions of rands, powerful businessmen, well-rehearsed presentations and ruthless attempts to discredit the competition were all part of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The snarling bidders were given one day each to astonish the IBA decision- makers. Everyone put their best foot forward and hopscotched as daintily as they could around their inquisitors. Their main objective for six hours each was to appear to the great and good councillors like well-balanced angels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their manners were impeccable, their attitudes reverent and their tastes in suits said as much about them as their bids: David Blood Associates,R60- million, petrol blue polyester mix; Worldwide Consortium, R130-million, black mandarin collared cotton; Newshelf 63, R320-million, pinstripe double- breasted wool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the bidders, raising huge amounts of cash was one thing. Meeting an array of politically correct criteria was another. The main cause for panic was undoubtedly the IBA's dreaded &quot;suggestions&quot; regarding the &quot;historically disadvantaged&quot;. The HD catchphrase became the string of rainbow coloured fairy lights that strung together every proposal. For black entrepreneurs, historical disadvantage was a Godsend. For those with the money, historical disadvantage was a pain in the butt. (Super-rich Primedia 40% shareholders of Newshelf and 100% financers of the R320-million bid, were entering the arena of democratic privatisation for the second time in as many weeks and they looked frazzled by the process.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA criteria made creating the perfect applicant an excruciating exercise in super-slick casting for all bidders and to this end extraordinary consortiums were formed. Dozens of historically advantaged men leapt into bed with anyone black, left-wing or female. Black-owned Rainbow Investments were given a 25 % shareholding in the David Blood bid free of charge. Black- comprised Zerilda Investment has a 60% shareholding in the Newshelf bid. This is not a gift. Primedia will loan their partners the bulk of their capital requirement at a rate above prime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blood's offer to his black partners would have looked generous by comparison if only he had any money. Unfortunately, what Blood thought was a guaranteed loan of R60-million from Absa turned out to be nothing more than a conditional declaration of intent fom Messrs Hercules du Preez and Henk van der Merwe at the bank. They will guarantee the loan only once Blood has secured ownership of Highveld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide Consortium was the only Highveld bidder that could boast proportionate investment representation with no share crossover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The straining to fulfil the the IBA criteria had been stressful for the bidders, but facing the razor sharp IBA panel seemed worse. The first to meet the shredder was the David Blood consortium ... well, just David Blood really.  The scene was a sorry one. A couple of opposition players wafted through the auditorium early in the day, but soon left. Fortunately, the remainder of his audience, comprising a few tired journalists and a one-legged Smal Street wanderer, was seated behind him. However, Blood's view of a twitchy John Matisonn, deadpan Dr Sibeletso Mokone-Matabane, ratty Peter De Klerk and astonished Lyndall Shope-Mafole was unobstructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of Blood's black partners turned up and he didn't have R60-million, but his main problem seemed to be an inability to fill out the application form correctly. His proposed station was in fact &quot;music driven&quot; rather than &quot; full service&quot;, his consortium's legal status was questionable and for anything he wasn't sure of, he simply left a blank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Worldwide Consortium didn't leave any blanks. When they had finally seated their panel of six and three rows of spectating lawyers and investors, what faced the IBA looked formidable. Welcome Msomi, Michael Markovitz, Joe Makobe, Phutuma Nhleko, Rina Broomberg, Tuli Zuma. Mostly black, mostly male, sometimes hip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of the auditorium swelled with Newshelf opposition. (Blood did not attend.) Stan Katz of Primedia/Newshelf looking very rich, strode in and grinned smugly at the Worldwide Consortium. David Dison representing Worldwide looking like Stan Katz the younger, grinned back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testosterone - the kind with money - clogged the air. There was much cocky, sumo-like psyching out from both sides, and the contact sport of handshaking was rife. The Worldwide panel, deprived of eye-contact with Newshelf, looked like they were about to don New Zealand rugby shirts and start puffing at John Matisonn instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly there was a flash of light as an overhead projector was flicked on.  The Worldwide Consortium presentation was about to begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were pie charts and breakdowns and bullet points of every description.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide had all the right stuff money, lots of non-tokenist historically disadvantaged investors, struggle backgrounds, solid businessmen and Welcome Msomi, whose light, anecdotal presentation even softened Sebiletso's stare somewhat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lone female seat was filled by Rina Broomberg. Although only employed by Worldwide as a consultant at present, Broomberg conducted a lengthly presentation which seemed to indicate that she may end up running the station single-handed. Her claims of expertise in the fields of training, management, programming and social work paled only next to her ability to spot radio talent from a distance of 30 paces. (A veteran of 702, Broomberg listed Stan Katz among her recruitment successes.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide also had Michael Markovitz and David Dison in their corner. Even Newshelf's objections which were raised at the end of the Worldwide punt were laughed off. All Worldwide's ducks were in a row, all their transparencies were in order, but when it came to question time, the panelists began to squirm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy is not always a teddy bear and IBA councillors don't clap after neat presentations. Instead they pick arguments apart and spot contradictions as easily as if they had red flags poking out of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They threw out several seemingly simple questions about sexism and programming that froze the panel. Broomberg's view did not seem to satisfy the council on gender issues and the affable Mr Msomi was caught so off-guard by the aggressive questioning regarding content, that he nervously declared that all the songs to be aired on the station would be sung in English perhaps even the French ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After lunch the Worldwide panel were more composed. In fact Matisson's possibly ambiguous reasons for asking why Worldwide thought the IBA should even consider a bid R190-million less than Newshelf's far from unsettling the panel, gave Markovitz an opportunity to hold the moral highground for several minutes on what he believed the IBA was there to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newshelf's hearing started 30 minutes late. The foyer thronged with Primedia/Newshelf supporters. Worldwide was present but not overbearingly so and David Blood was standing around, being ignored by the big boys. Apart from the usual male component, there was also a scattering of pretty young ladies in suits and nail polish. As they had not appeared before, it can be assumed they were part of the Newshelf camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time the hearing began, the auditorium had been transformed into corporate heaven. Newshelf/Primedia family friends and loyal employees filled virtually every seat in the room. Archangel Katz looked as pleased as punch, and humbly took his seat near the edge of the bidder's table. The Newshelf Chair was filled by labour lawyer Kuben Pillay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to be outdone by Worldwide, Newshelf's presentation was supported by computer generated images that flashed and shifted and boasted a team of 17 at the bidders' table, nearly as black as Worldwide's panel, with Albert Luthuli's granddaughter Nomhle Gcabashe possibly tipping the scales of political correctness in their favour. They were showing off a bit, but they did look impressive in a corporate sort of way. The presentation was mostly tedious and the rhetoric was embarrassing but when it was Worldwide's turn to lodge their objections, ennui was not their beef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide lawyer Derek Rabin voiced a cluster of objections which seemed to open a can of worms so foul that even Newshelf winced for a while. Worldwide scrutiny of Newshelf's shareholder's agreement which had only reluctantly been made public on August 23 exposed an alarming degree of non-democratic control over just about every aspect of Newshelf by Primedia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly all Newshelf's silver clouds appeared to have charcoal linings. If the objections could be sustained the IBA would be hard pressed to grant Highveld to Newshelf, without making a mockery of themselves, the Act, the new South African way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katz pulled at his chin, the Newshelf chair mumbled to colleagues either side of him, and the Primedia lawyer fumbled nervously with a clumsy hand- held microphone before deferring back to the chair, without doing anything but giggling. &quot;Er ...&quot; stammered Pillay, &quot;Could we break for lunch now?&quot; A roar of laughter went up from the audience, and lunch started 10 minutes early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 2pm a chortling Worldwide contingent took their seats as did a shell- shocked Newshelf. It was now the IBA's turn to winkle out the truth. Lyndall Shope-Mafole was especially inquisitive and Primedia initially stumbled through most of their answers on labour, training and profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But somehow, by the end of the gruelling session, they had largely managed to escape the web of horrors which their own documentation had spun for them and even a very nervous Chris Gibbons (Primedia director) looked slightly less in need of a Rennie than he had done an hour earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA councillors are no fools. A nation's desire for diversified airwaves ownership lies in capable hands. Theoretically, all three bidders stand a chance of winning Highveld, but if it goes to David Blood, black listeners will probably number 0 within a week and news time in minutes per day will total 5. A Worldwide win might have Rina Broomberg running everything and possibly trying to hire Stan Katz. And should Newshelf get it, judging by their labour- loving presentation, then the cleaning lady will be in charge and gum-boot dancing at tea-time willl be compulsory subject to approval by Primedia of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bidding For A Licence To Print Money (Sidebar)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When it was announced that the SABC was to sell six of its regional radio stations everybody cheered. Government rubbed its hands in anticipation of receiving a huge whack of much needed revenue. Potential bidders were finally in with a chance of becoming rich as well as famous.  Even the public agreed that 70 years of listening to turgid, conservative airplay was enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these are not the only things in the sale's favour. What industry could be more honourably privatised than the monstrous broadcaster of Nationalist propaganda not to mention Afrikaans pop music? This, combined with it's unfashionable legacy as a monopoly, made it imperative the auction be conducted with impecable political correctness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the SABC is the seller, the final decision regarding a buyer lies in the hands of the democratically endowed IBA. The selling off and opening up of the airwaves is the biggest privatisation deal this country has seen since Iscor was sold off in the 1980s. The stakes are high but IBA involvement should ensure no automatic triumph for the highest bidder and no depressing tales of corruption as a consequence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first round of bidding for three of the six prime, established radio stations came to an end on Wednesday in Johannesburg. The bidding started off in Cape Town a fortnight ago with Newshelf 63, Crescent Consortium and Moribo fighting for control of KFM. Next to come under the hammer was Natal's East Coast Radio bid for by Dynamo Investments, New Radio Consortium and Moribo Consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&amp;G Media, owner of the Mail &amp; Guardian, is associated with the New Radio Consortium which bid for Radio Oranje as well as East Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's Johannesburg hearings saw another clash between Newshelf and Worldwide with the third bidder being David Blood Associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakes are high and the bids range from R11- million from Free State Media for Radio Oranje to R320-million from Newshelf for Highveld Stereo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The booty is precious, and any businessman worth his weight in feathers knows that to have a stake in one or more of the stations is more than a licence to say &quot;hello mum&quot; to millions at will it's virtually a licence to print money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the process has been a non-sexist, non- racist highly democratic one, for a non-refundable fee of R30 000 anyone could be a player and for a few dozen million rand on top of that anyone could be a contender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most controversial bidder is undoubtedly Newshelf. The consortium which is 40% Primedia owned and would be almost 100% Primedia controlled, has made them an easy target. Should Newshelf win the bid for Highveld it would effectively mean that Primedia, which already owns 100% of Radio 702, could hog almost half of Gauteng's adspend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As regards the possibility of Newshelf winning both its regional bids as well as its two new radio licences, its competitors have raised objections on the grounds that this could become a monopoly in the making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A valid concern in the sense that it would then control three up-and- running, adspend-rich radio stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, if all goes well, in six months' time there should be 46 new radio stations in Gauteng alone. With people like Richard Branson as probable competitors, some healthy competition and consequent spreading of adspend jam would be ensured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vetting of bidders as regards labour relations has also thrown light on Primedia shortcomings in this regard, and therefore the possibility of mirrored problems for Newshelf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When John Matisonn asked Stan Katz of Newshelf whether 702 employees were union members, Katz replied that they were not, as there had never been any need for such membership. This is not quite true as some 702 journalists have been warned against becoming union members, and the reply prompted a smile from Matisonn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having said this, between the IBA and fellow competitors little dirt was dug up on most applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the SABC and government have agreed to accept the decision of the IBA as final regarding winning bidders. But this too is not yet a fait accompli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legally, as current owners, the SABC could refuse to accept the IBA's decision. It would be a scandal. It would be a slap in the face for the entire democratic process, but if Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Jay Naidoo et al are faced with a difference in price of R190-million for one station alone, they just might buckle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - More than 28 000 cattle valued at about R75-million have been stolen in the Eastern Cape this year as organised syndicates increase their supply of cut- price meat to the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several farmers have thrown in the towel as the cattle-rustling figures have already doubled what they were for the whole of last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 35 highly organised syndicates which specialise in supplying illegal meat to townships and unscrupulous butcheries have been identified by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arresting the culprits has proved almost impossible for anti-stock theft units as most of the meat has already been bought by the township clientele before the beasts are slaughtered. Even if meat is found, linking it to a specific carcass or crime requires costly DNA testing. Police say that often by the time a crime has been discovered, &quot;the evidence has already been eaten&quot; . Farms hardest hit by the cattle-rustling often border on the townships.  East Cape regional anti-stock theft co-ordinator Superintendent Richard Smith said this week &quot;90% of all kills end-up in the townships. These groups are so organised that they already have customers waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very difficult for police to investigate because most people in the townships are too scared to inform, for fear of getting their throats slit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, Smith said the theft of stock belonging to township residents was negligible as most culprits &quot;are scared of getting caught and killed&quot; by the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several farmers bordering the townships say although the police &quot;try hard&quot;, they are fighting a losing battle against the rustlers. Ecna</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - On November 17 the public will be able to scrutinise a special register concerning MPs' financial interests. MPs, senators and President Nelson Mandela himself will have to detail earnings, gifts and other benefits on special forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows the adoption earlier this month of the Code of Conduct in Regard to Financial Interests. A Committee on Members' Interests, chaired by Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal, was set up this week to supervise the implementation of the code.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-member committee consists of nine African National Congress members, two each from the Democratic Party and National Party and one from the Pan African Congress and African Christian Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of their first tasks will be to encourage members to comply. &quot;Members will have to know this is not an attempt at policing them, but an exercise in good governance,&quot; said parliamentary official Kamal Mansura. &quot;We will need members' co-operation to get it off the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee decided two forms would be circulated to members. One would involve details to form the public part of the register, while the other would cover information that will remain confidential. Gathering information will start on September 16 with a deadline of October 16. A month later, interested members of the public will be able to learn about members' shareholdings (market value will be confidential), outside jobs (remuneration will be confidential), directorships and partnerships (remuneration confidential), consultancies, sponsorships and other benefits (value confidential). Members will also have to disclose all gifts worth more than R350 received since May 21; details of land and property held (information about private homes will be confidential), pensions (value confidential) and foreign trips except private visits, party-paid trips and business trips unrelated to their role as MPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone entitled to be present and take part in Parliament's proceedings is covered by the code, which is why Mandela will be among those making a declaration. The rules also cover members' spouses, permanent companions and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only the Committee on Members' Interests will have sight of the confidential part of the register. While the committee will be able to hear complaints behind closed doors, it has a duty to publish its findings as well as a summary of the facts. Members who contravene the code can be fined up to one month's salary or be suspended from Parliament for 15 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary official Peter Lilienfeld, who will serve as registrar until the committee appoints one, said it was possible the public register would be made available on the Internet as well as being open for scrutiny in Parliament.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A number of African National Congress ministers are trying to breathe new life into the Masakhane Campaign by making Deputy President Thabo Mbeki its new figurehead. Mbeki will promote payment of rates and taxes, as part of the drive to create a &quot;new patriotism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative from the Constitutional Development Ministry, Mpho Msmane, said Mbeki would be taking political responsibility for Masakhane, although the programme would be driven from within the Constitutional Development Ministry under Minister Valli Moosa. The second thrust of the campaign, he said, was to persuade provincial premiers to drive the campaign regionally from their offices. Meetings with premiers are under way.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Masakhane campaign, launched last year, failed to convince citizens to pay their rates and taxes. It was a campaign planned and driven by former housing minister Jo Slovo, constitutional development minister Roelf Meyer and minister without portfolio Jay Naidoo, all of whom left their portfolios, leaving Masakhane in the hands of their successors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Msmane believes the first launch of Masakhane created a national profile for the campaign, and now was the time to really bring its message home. He said that the media had mistakenly emphasised the payment of rates and taxes as the only element in the campaign. There were other strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about teaching people civic responsibility,&quot; he said. &quot;It's about ending the Eighties culture of destroying state assets because they were part of the apartheid system. It's about telling people that they must report on criminals for the sake of the community. It's about teaching people to take ownership of their communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents on the revitalisation of the campaign urge officials to put the payment of rates and taxes in the right context. Other aspects that need to be introduced are social partnerships between communities, businesses, civics and municipalities, and the promotion of local economic development.  The document concludes with these words: &quot;Masakhane is a call to all South Africans to build the country through unity and solidarity. There should be efforts towards dealing with previous divides by developing programmes ...  that will promote the new patriotism. Racism and ethnicity have to be eradicated through a new consciousness and value system that promotes equity and justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Payment of rates and taxes, however, is crucial to empower newly elected local governments to deliver the services the ANC promised in the 1994 elections. The momentum for the revitalisation of Masakhane has its origins in Shell House's policy unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although decisions have been taken behind the scenes, a memorandum is being drawn up on the campaign for Cabinet approval. Msmane said a great deal of consultation with communities needed to take place before the revitalisation campaign was officially announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Reconstruction and Development Programme monitor Gavin Lewis believes Mbeki will be flogging a dead horse: &quot;I just don't see this campaign working unless they have a secret formula ... or perhaps they set measurable targets for the provincial premiers and say they must answer to Mbeki should they not reach the targets. Otherwise it just becomes a woolly feel-good picture. The previous campaign failed; the picture of non-payment is a dismal one.&quot; (Pic: Thabo Mbeki)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - They've been described as student radicals, and they've certainly got the T-shirts earned during careers which took them from student activism to jail, exile and working underground for the African National Congress. But Billy Masethla, the new head of the South African Secret Service (Sass) and Barry Gilder, his deputy, would prefer to have themselves seen as &quot;democratic spies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their appointment brings the former comrades-in-arms full circle: they once worked together briefly in Botswana. Masethla, now 41, landed there in 1979 following his release from jail after helping as an underground ANC operative direct the uprising unleashed by events in Soweto in 1976 and reorganising the student movement, helping launch the Congress of South African Students and the Azanian Students' Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilder, now 46, served a term on the national executive of the National Union of South African Students (Nusas) before heading for London and ANC membership in 1976. He joining Umkhonto weSizwe and the ANC's department of intelligence and security (DIS) in Angola in 1979. He headed DIS in Botswana from 1983 to 1989 and served with Masethla on the regional political and military council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had the struggle not intervened, Masethla might have become a teacher; instead, he was trained in military combat work in Angola, specialising in intelligence and counter-intelligence and completing an intelligence officer's course in the former East Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilder, blessed with a rich baritone, was known for the political songs he wrote and performed at Nusas congresses. In exile he got involved in cultural politics, helping stage the Culture and Resistance Festival in Gaborone in 1982, before undergoing guerrilla training, specialising in intelligence, in the former Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He doesn't sing in public anymore, he says, &quot;Except in the bath when I have time to have a bath. It was impossible to keep up singing underground, apart from entertaining comrades in safe houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His and Masethla's training different in style and content to that undergone by South African intelligence agents under the old order has advantages, Gilder says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The training those of us in the ANC got in the former Soviet Union and East Germany, seen in relation to the training my present colleagues from the old order got, stands us in good stead as a service. We now have the best of both worlds.&quot; Their mission, defined by the changed realities of post- Cold War geo-politics and South Africa's transition, involves refocusing Sass. The old &quot;them and us&quot; paradigm no longer applies: national security today is defined less in military terms and more in terms of the full range of political, economic, military, social, religious, ethnic and technological factors that shape security issues around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closer to home, they have to oversee the cementing together in Sass of the various contrasting attitudes and styles of operating that the amalgamation of operatives from the liberation movement, the Bantustans and the old secret service has brought about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our biggest challenge is to change the focus and direction of Sass. The amalgamation brought to the party people who targeted each other in the struggle. That basis for intelligence has gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masethla's wealth of experience in political intelligence and organisational work are said to stand him in good stead for this. &quot;He is a very energetic person, very disciplined, with good leadership skills and a commitment to measured, achievable transformation,&quot; said an intelligence source. &quot;Despite his background, he is able to carry all sectors of the service behind him which is a very necessary skill in this period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, new legislation passed this year has set up a range of checks and balances none of their predecessors ever had to worry about. Said Gilder: &quot;This means we have to change how we behave and how we collect intelligence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described Sass's role as providing the government, which now has completely different information requirements, with &quot;the kind of intelligence it really needs and that will make sense to it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presence of foreign intelligence services had &quot;increased quite dramatically&quot;, he said. &quot;South Africa has become the pet interest of many countries in terms of trade and economic opportunities and political influence in Southern Africa and Africa. The bigger powers are keen to know what makes us tick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our strategic goals, in broad strokes, are to effect a transformation where we can change the nature and conduct of intelligence so as to be able to provide this new government with the intelligence it needs to conduct foreign policy and trade effectively with other countries and to watch out not only for dangers, but also for opportunities for the country.&quot; (Pic: Gilder) (pic:Masethla)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Caught between the rock of its abolitionist principles and the hard place of a constituency ravaged by crime and clamouring for revenge, the African National Congress seized control of the death penalty debate this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recommendation from the ANC's crime summit last weekend asked its leadership to &quot;consider reconsidering&quot; its long-standing opposition to the death penalty. Senior ANC MP Carl Niehaus moved quickly this week to &quot;clarify&quot; the resolution as little more than a recommendation to the ANC's National Executive Committee to &quot;consider whether we need to re-examine our position&quot;, but added that a &quot;positive outcome of the debate could be a move to restate the ANC's arguments against the death penalty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Niehaus noted that &quot;once the initial hype settled down, there has subsequently begun to be a serious debate on the issue&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sharp contrast to the recent focus on opposition campaigns for the reopening of the gallows, most major newspapers this week rallied behind the hard- won campaign which closed the door on executions last year. Human rights groups rallied behind their sacred principle, and the ANC's most vocal abolitionists dusted off their ammunition to launch a counter-offensive against &quot;knee-jerk responses to crime&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Human Rights registered its &quot;disappointment&quot; at the ANC's call to reconsider: &quot;It is difficult to imagine how the reintroduction of the death penalty will in any way assist the police, the justice system or the penal sytem in dealing with crime,&quot; said LHR national director Jody Kollapen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International expressed dismay at the possible volte face: &quot;South African society cannot be further brutalised by institutionalising state- sanctioned murder. The death penalty is the gravest form of human rights abuse, and the ANC should not be deterred from its course of human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Amnesty report on the death penalty suggested South Africa would be bucking the global trend away from capital punishment if it reversed the current status quo: 100 countries worldwide have either outlawed the death penalty or have not used it since 1985. Only four countries have reintroduced the death penalty in the past decade of these four, Nepal has since reabolished it and The Gambia, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines have not used it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's most celebrated death row survivor, Magoo's bar bomber and Deputy Director of Foreign Affairs Robert McBride, rallied behind the party's abolitionist stance, saying pro-hanging arguments represented a &quot;jump in logic&quot; for communities reeling from the crime wave. &quot;I've never come across a death row prisoner who thought at the time he committed the crime that he'd be hanged. Even in the heydey of apartheid, when they were hanging 167 people a year, crime skyrocketed. The real problem is that criminals know they won't be caught,&quot; McBride said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other ANC leaders argued that the death penalty provided no solution to the crime wave. &quot;There's no proof that it acts as a deterrent even in developing countries unless you're talking about an authoritarian society,&quot; said ANC MP Blade Nzimande.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC justice committee chair Johnny de Lange said the debate had diverted attention from the &quot;real issue of the transformation of the justice system&quot; which the party had begun to tackle at the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the summit's decision to &quot;acknowledge&quot; the public outcry in favour of hanging including public opinion polls placing support for hanging at about 70% and indicating substantial ANC grassroots support for the death penalty ANC leaders this week swiftly countered opposition calls for a referendum on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party, Inkatha Freedom Party, Freedom Front and some Democratic Party leaders said they were in favour of a test of the electorate, but ANC leaders stood firm in their belief that &quot;some issues cannot be subjected to the vagaries of public opinion&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nzimande said: &quot;If we were to hold a referendum on every contentious issue, this country would be nowhere. If we had subjected the Government of National Unity to a referendum, it would never have been accepted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McBride argued there were other equally contentious issues, like land reform, over which nobody demanded referendums: &quot;If we called a vote on land reform, most people would demand the immediate return of land that was taken from them under apartheid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial and Constitutional Affairs Ministry spokesman Mpho Mosimane warned that any attempt to chip away at the human rights culture enshrined in the Constitution's Bill of Rights could have a &quot;ripple effect&quot; on other rights. A return to the death penalty would require the removal or amendment of the right to life clause in the Bill of Rights, but &quot;other rights, such a abortion, may also be affected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If we were to hold a referendum on every contentious issue, this country would be nowhere'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Paul Ekon, the flamboyant young multi-millionaire who hosted Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's 50th birthday party, had a bizarre legal skirmish with a former Robben Island inmate who Ekon claimed accused him of drug dealing and hit-squad involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has recently emerged that Ekon (36) brought a R500 000 defamation action against African National Congress member and ex-political prisoner Peter-Paul Ngwenya in August 1994, but withdrew it 10 months later, days before the scheduled Rand Supreme Court hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papers filed by Ekon's lawyers claimed Ngwenya had said Ekon &quot;is a drug dealer&quot;; that Ekon &quot;worked with (former Security Police chief General) Basie Smit with a hit squad&quot;; and that Ekon &quot;was associated with the Robert Smit murders&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngwenya, a corporate relations specialist, denied in responding court papers that he had made the allegations. But the Mail &amp; Guardian understands &quot; warnings&quot; about Ekon who had befriended a number of top ANC leaders, possibly already before the organisation was unbanned in 1990 were circulated in the ANC at the time. Leaders were informed about an internal background check on Ekon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngwenya this week confirmed details of Ekon's defamation claim against him, and of its last-minute settlement. Ngwenya said he made no apologies and gave no undertakings: Ekon withdrew the suit and partly refunded his legal expenses. &quot;My feeling is he knew if it came to court he couldn't afford the negative publicity ... I was quite prepared to defend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G last month reported Ekon's claim to have co- sponsored Mbeki's 1992 birthday bash with two friends, &quot;ANC tailor&quot; Yusuf Surtee and clothing industrialist Charles Priebatsch. Both are on good terms with top ANC leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon's claim came after axed deputy minister Bantu Holomisa charged that hotel magnate Sol Kerzner had paid for the party, among other favours to ANC leaders. Mbeki broke his silence to confirm Ekon's version. But Holomisa, citing &quot;privileged information&quot;, maintained Ekon had only acted as a &quot;go- between&quot; for Kerzner. The party, attended by Kerzner among others, was held at Ekon's plush Houghton home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions remain about the circumstances in which Ekon who is friendly with Kerzner and dated Kerzner's ex-wife Anneline Kriel in the early 1990s left South Africa last year to base himself in London. Ekon said he left because of a &quot;business opportunity&quot;, denying he was the subject of a police investigation relating to foreign exchange irregularities or trade in precious materials. Ekon last month told the M&amp;G he had called ANC lawyer Ishmail Ayob, who in turn would have elicited an assurance from Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi that he was not under investigation. Ayob confirmed he acted for Ekon &quot;in commercial matters&quot;, but said: &quot;It seems to me you have something in your mind that is so big that the minister (Mufamadi) is involved ... Ministers don't deal with such matters ... Logic will tell you you don't pick up the phone to ask the minister, 'Are you looking for my client?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon also referred the M&amp;G to a letter lawyer Kobus du Plessis had written on his behalf a year ago to the South African Police Service, Interpol and the Witwatersrand attorney general's office. Ironically, Du Plessis's firm of attorneys, David H Botha, Du Plessis and Kruger, has also represented former Civil Co-operation Bureau (CCB) operatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter says in part: &quot;It is common cause that our client is presently resident in London, England, mainly due to business obligations. His intention remains to return to the Republic of South Africa as soon as possible, notwithstanding any possible police or other investigations against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Notwithstanding rumours and/or allegations ... it was confirmed to advocate E du Toit by your Mr Herman de Beer (of the attorney general's office) that our client is not currently a suspect in any criminal investigations, nor is he needed for any questioning ... Client confirms your Mr De Beer's confirmation that no warrant of arrest has been authorised against him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngwenya this week said Ekon's defamation claim resulted from discussions he had in July 1994 during talks on a significant &quot;black empowerment&quot; initiative for South Africa. The deal, which was driven by European interests and Ekon, and which in principle had the blessing of the ANC, later collapsed. During the course of the talks, he had been asked for a reference on Ekon, which he gave after making inquiries in the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngwenya said Ekon asked Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale to mediate on the court action. A meeting with Ekon ensued, during which Ekon offered to withdraw the defamation claim in exchange for an apology. Ngwenya refused, saying he was prepared to meet Ekon in court. Court papers show a settlement of the matter on June 19 last year, two days before the scheduled hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon was not available for comment at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This Friday sees the South African release of Crash, a movie so controversial it has not yet been News, features, released in the United States or the other services United Kingdom. Local distributors Nu-Metro are leading the international market with computing their bid to release the film completely uncut, but with a &quot;no-under 18&quot; (sex, nudity, violence) restriction, in limited cinemas across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nu Metro's decision was taken with extreme caution in the light of the fact that, three months since its award-winning premiere at the Cannes film festival, the film has yet to find a distributor in Britain. In addition, its American distributor, Fine Line, has put its release on hold until early next year after receiving an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. The harshness of the rating means that, as in the past, a portion of America's media will refuse to place advertising for the film.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Directed by Canadian David Cronenberg and based on a 1973 novel by British science fiction writer JG Ballard, Crash, which tells the tale of an underground cult which derives erotic pleasure from car crashes, created controversy from the outset. The film won the Special Jury Prize at Cannes but only after the jury was split down the middle and, after even lengthy discussion, remained divided. Eventually, the jury chair, Francis Ford Coppola, swayed the decision to give the award with his own vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to Britain's refusal to release the film, Ballard has lashed out at distributors for displaying &quot;timidity and triviality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, in the latest issue of Sight and Sound, a leading British film magazine, editor Philip Dodd says, &quot;To deny (Crash) will be to risk denying space for a whole range of 'difficult' movies, in which case Britain peculiar or not will be a much less interesting place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film-maker himself is far more direct, quoted on his home-page on the Internet as saying, &quot;Censors tend to do what only psychotics do ... they confuse reality with illusion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The realities of the South African release will only be clear after this weekend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Some of South Africa's top business leaders come under fire in a new book on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission co-authored by Water Affairs Minister computing Kader Asmal which fingers companies which supported apartheid. Reconciliation through Truth, soon to be published by David Philip, makes a strong case for the truth commission to seek testimony from company bosses who either supported apartheid or whose corporate practices trampled human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The text recalls pro-apartheid statements from men such as Gavin Relly, who took over the helm of Anglo American when Harry Oppenheimer retired in 1982.  Relly said at the time he, like Oppenheimer, did not favour &quot;one man, one vote&quot; as that &quot;would simply be a formula for unadulterated chaos at this point in time in our history&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors quote Oppenheimer's official biographer, Anthony Hocking, who said the magnate &quot;never subscribed to the view that apartheid was morally wrong. In his view, it was at root an honest attempt to cope with overwhelming racial problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rembrandt head Anton Rupert, now a member of the influential &quot;Brenthurst Club&quot; which advises the government on economic issues had similar views: &quot; After many African countries became free they got dictatorships like Idi Amin's. We have to find a solution that won't end up giving us one man, one vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors Asmal, his wife Louise and Trinidadian lawyer Ronald Roberts show that in the 1960s big business had been even more open in its support of Pretoria. In 1967 the South Africa Foundation, whose members included Oppenheimer and Rupert, said in an advertisement in the Sunday Times that ns should stop apologising for apartheid and instead &quot;substitute a tone of confident self-assertion which publicised the opportunities of apartheid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1971, the foundation claimed its propaganda efforts had helped to &quot;stem the tide of ignorance, criticism and misrepresentation against the republic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Asmals and Roberts say South Africa's truth seekers have so far not broached the idea of &quot;corporate war criminals&quot; like Japan's Kajimi Gumi company, tried in 1945 for using war prisoners and kidnapped Chinese civilians as labourers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the authors hint there is much light to be shed on the details of corporate connivance in apartheid, they signal the collaborating companies themselves were aware of the substance of their &quot;crimes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the late-middle 1980s, Anglo American directors privately discussed the fear their company would be remembered as the IG Farben of apartheid, a reference to the company that, through slave labour, became the industrial backbone of the Third Reich,&quot; they write.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors also accuse South Africa's mining giants of exploiting the migrant labour system, killing more than 69 000 workers in the past 94 years, and boasting of the availability of cheap apartheid labour to international investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the book implies the Truth and Reconciliation Commission should pay more attention to the corporate world's connivance in apartheid, it does not examine the sensational but unproved claims by human rights campaigners and lawyers that some companies indulged in &quot;dirty tricks&quot; operations claims which would be ideal material for any truth commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most celebrated of these allegations is that Sasol used KwaZulu police hit-squad operatives trained in the Caprivi Strip to help quell strikes in the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Goldstone Commission on &quot;third force&quot; violence, witnesses alleged that nine former Caprivi trainees including a man called Xesibe who was in charge of the trainees were dispatched to Secunda, the hub of Sasol's sanctions-busting synthetic fuel operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MZ Khumalo, Mangosuthu Buthelezi's right-hand man, told the commission at the time that they were sent as &quot;ordinary labourers&quot;. Asked how he could reconcile this explanation and the decision to send Xesibe to accompany the men, he said under cross- examination: &quot;The atmosphere was very tense in the mines and all the places at the time and I was anxious about keeping control of the group that they did not get involved in any of the violence that was taking place there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In written argument presented to the commission, lawyers cited evidence from Bongeni Khumalo that a Sasol official had on several occasions asked MZ Khumalo to organise men to act as strike breakers and that MZ Khumalo had personally selected Xesibe and the others to attack strikers. The commission was also presented with a letter sent to the KwaZulu Department of the Chief Minister, in which Khumalo referred to the secondment of Xesibe to Secunda for &quot;my project&quot;. However, a Business Day article quoted Khumalo denying that Sasol had used KwaZulu police members as hit men at Secunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission is unlikely, at this stage, to hold any hearings on human rights abuses committed by various companies during the apartheid era.  Harry Oppenheimer 'never subscribed to the view that apartheid was morally wrong'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - Kenneth Kaunda, leader of the main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP), boycotted a scheduled second round of inter-party talks with President Frederick Chiluba Monday, intended to defuse the current political and constitutional impasse in Zambia. Kaunda's acting public relations officer and press spokesman, Steven Moyo, told PANA that the UNIP leader would only attend the talks if they involved all other major political parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter Kaunda wrote Chiluba Friday, Kaunda expressed misgivings about the president's current one-on-one consultations with opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. president we (UNIP) wish to reiterate our position that any discussion of all national issues should involve all the major stakeholders in a meeting at the same time,&quot; Kaunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without other leaders, Kaunda said, today's meeting would be useless.  Kaunda, Zambia's first president, said that his party wanted an all-party national conference to discuss the disputed constitution and the electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said that the agenda should include equitable access to public media and other public resources. UNIP is also seeking a review of the public order act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia Democratic Congress, the country's third largest opposition party, also said Monday it will not attend similar talks scheduled Tuesday with Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel time is running out for bilateral talks and prefer that the president and the ruling party meet us all as opposition at once,&quot; party Deputy General-Secretary Azwell Banda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the current format of talks seem to give the impression that the opposition were seeking individual favors from the government when, in fact, &quot;it is the national matters that are at stake and which needs to be discussed and resolved collectively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda and the Democratic Congress party president, Dean Mu'ngomba, held separate exploratory talks with Chiluba last week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, - The United Nations goodwill mission on the disputed Bakassi peninsula, scheduled to leave New York Friday for Nigeria and Cameroon, has been delayed, a UN spokesperson, Sylvana Foa, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told UN correspondents in New York that the mission had to be delayed because its itinerary coincided with that of a commonwealth delegation, which is due in Nigeria next week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are waiting to hear from the Nigerian ambassador (to the UN) for a better date,&quot; Foa added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission had been scheduled to travel September 6-18, to the two countries, which have clashed repeatedly since 1994 over the oil-rich peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-member team, to be headed by a retired UN staffer, Omar Halim of Indonesia, was also scheduled to visit the disputed peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission's mandate includes gathering information and formulating suggestions which might help the parties to the conflict to adopt confidence- building measures, and consequently establish an atmosphere of mutual trust and confidence between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also expected to examine concrete and specific measures designed to reduce tension between the two countries and prevent a deterioration of the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has stepped up its efforts to mediate since February, when fighting over the peninsula flared up again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute is before the International Court of justice at the Hague, which said in a provisional ruling March 15 that both countries should observe a cease-fire until a final ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameroon has also reported the matter to the Organization of African Unity, while Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema has been involved in diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE, Swaziland - Several thousand bare breasted Swazi maidens, wearing skimpy colored bead skirts and woolen tassels in the country's colors of red, blue and yellow, at the weekend swayed their graceful bodies to the slow rhythmic sounds of the annual reed dance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first day began with a series of these traditional dances, or Umhlanga, and songs by each maiden presenting a bundle of freshly cut tall golden reeds to the queen mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reeds are used for repairing the fencing around the royal village. But cutting and presenting the reeds to the queen mother, with the annual gathering of the nation's childless unmarried girls, has great significance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swazi elders say it symbolizes and encourages unity, moral and physical self discipline, a sense of service to the nation and affection for the queen mother -- the Indlovukati or she-elephant, the mother of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After presenting their reeds, the maidens, led by royal princesses, danced slowly past the king and queen mother both in traditional attire. They were flanked by royal guests, including members of the diplomatic corps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The maidens then formed an arc, stamped their feet in unison and chanted songs as groups of maidens of different age groups from about 10 years to their late teens danced in the center of the arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highlight of the ceremony came when King Mswati, 28, dressed in a leopard skin skirt and bearing a shield and knob stick, joined in the dancing.  His royal queens, princes and Swazi and Zulu traditional warriors also took part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A record number of maidens, estimated at 5,000, proved unjustified, the fears expressed by the public that increasing teenage pregnancies could rob the Swazis of one of their proudest crowd drawing events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event is always held at King Mswati's royal residence, Ludzidzini. And the weekend's occasion lived up to its reputation as one of Africa's most colorful and popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massive crowds, including visitors from neighbouring countries and foreign journalists, attended the two-day ceremony which was also broadcast live by Swaziland Television.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal - Due to its abundant medicinal plants, the village of Oku in north-western Cameroon, has turned into an all-year round attraction for local and foreign visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, the road leading to Oku, 100 km (62.5 miles) from Bamenda, the provincial capital, is almost impassable during the dry and rain seasons because of its rocks, potholes, dust or mud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of these problems, the number of visitors has continued to grow as people troop to the area to collect rare plants in forests around Oku.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting about Oku, the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) referred to the village as a vast &quot;open air clinic&quot; because it attracts a large number of Cameroonians and foreigners seeking a cure for their ailments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it comes to medicine, this forest is like a man's heart for the people here,&quot; writes the August issue of the WWF newsletter, which quoted a prominent traditional herbalist, Tatah Isaiah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tatah, who runs his healing business in Bamenda, regularly travels to Oku to replenish his herb stock for treating diseases such as mental derangement, epilepsy, gastritis, stomach-aches, taenia, snake bites, gonorrhea, injuries, fever and hypertension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, John Nchami Tafor, WWF's public relations and information officer in Cameroon, says the medicinal plants in Oku forest and surrounding areas are getting over-stretched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the example of pygueum (Brunus Africana), a plant whose bark is believed to be a cure for prostate cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as pharmaceutical companies learnt of these qualities, they rushed to harvest the plant. As a result, Nchami wrote, the plant has virtually disappeared from the forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To reverse the constant loss of medicinal plants in the area, WWF encouraged communities to start nurseries on which various plant species were planted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WWF is also assisting the Cameroonian ministry of the environment's Mount Kilum botanic assessment project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Findings from the project are expected to be used by Oku traditional rulers to introduce effective methods for the management of what remains of their forests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Tafor, an assessment of 16 out of 70 plants has already been done, giving their scientific and local names, features, the place where they grow and their medical qualities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another list, the WWF provided other uses for the medicinal plants, which can serve as natural pesticide, fuel, building materials, fences, timber and fibers. They are also useful in dyeing and craft industries, veterinary care, honey production, wine and other food products.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg -The town of Bailundo, set in the , farmlands of central Huambo, has always played a significant role in Angolan history. Once home to the Ovimbundu kings, famous for leading a 1902 rebellion against Portuguese rule, the town is now home to a different ruler. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi turned the town into the new headquarters for the Uniaco Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (Unita) in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last month the third extraordinary congress of Unita, now celebrating 30 years of resistance to Portuguese and Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA) rule, was held amid the mix of renovated and shell-damaged buildings of Bailundo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the town centre, the city hall was draped with red and green flags sporting the symbolic black cockerel crowing at dawn. Inside, the walls were plastered with paintings of Unita's African heroes Nelson Mandela, Kwame Nkrumah, Gamal Nasser and many more lined the entry to the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when Savimbi arrived at the congress venue, the music of Jean Michel Jarre filled the air. The town's new king looked healthy and young, his cropped head neatly clipped with not a grey hair in sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media are keen to discover why there have been interminable delays in cementing a peace accord for the country. The latest is due to Savimbi's rejection of the vice presidency, a post he had agreed to accept until recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent demand that a senior Unita staffer fill the post came as a surprise to all at the United Nations, the Troika (Russia, America and Portugal) and the MPLA. Savimbi added at the congress that the integration of the rival parties' armed forces, delayed by security problems, and the MPLA's use of mercenaries, are other factors stalling the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unita is now insisting that all 40 generals in its high command be integrated into the MPLA's Angolan Armed Forces a move possibly designed to quell growing discontent in Unita's military ranks as officers demand the same treatment as the movement's political leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the generals, recently promoted by Unita, have allegedly been responsible for major human rights atrocities in Angola. The move is possibly designed to obtain a guarantee of safety from the MPLA and the United Nations so that these people can effectively be indemnified against punishment for war crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPLA announced recently in Luanda a general amnesty for all war crimes committed since 1992, but few in the Unita ranks believe this will come about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congress made it obvious that Unita has little intention of returning now or soon to Luanda. Savimbi insisted he wanted to remain president of Unita, a post he would have to relinquish if he became deputy president of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Bailundo he makes endless demands that will continue to paralyse the Angolan government and economy. With his militia and civilian supporters being accommodated by the United Nations, the status quo can continue indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has also played an important role in the supply of logistics to Unita's quartering areas, through recent multi-million dollar donations. An estimated $30-million a month from diamond revenue is also making Unita a profitable venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A party celebrating Unita's success at the end of the congress perhaps reflected the new fortunes of Unita's leaders, who entertained congress members with imported French champagne and wine, Schol beer made under licence in Zaire and whisky from the heartlands of Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A block away from the congress hall, lay the reality of Unita. Heavily armed commandos patrolled the streets with the familiar and dreaded red berets on their heads, as ominous reminders that the movement's special forces are far from being quartered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the town a silence prevails. People talk in whispers, no one laughs out loud, the streets are full of people but empty of voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to interview or meet locals from Bailundo are totally out of the question. They scamper away at the sight of journalists. The eyes of Unita officials fill with fear when reasonable questions are asked. Asking questions is the task of only senior people, who also prefer to answer questions with questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A press conference held by Savimbi on the last day after the congress reflected the movement's ongoing xenophobia. The first critical question directed at Savimbi erupted into loud jeers and booing from the audience. The bemused Portuguese journalist glanced back into a sea of angry faces and sat down. But there was no mercy and he was called on again to repeat his question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was not the time or the place to ask questions on past human rights violations, the war against ordinary Angolans or the nine-month siege of Quito which forced its dehumanised people to eat dogs and the bodies of the dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the fate of South African mercenaries captured and held, Savimbi suggested &quot;the question be put to the MPLA who employed them&quot;. But the fate of these men now seems evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The South Africans ... captured by Unita?&quot; asks General Arlindo Pena known as &quot;Ben Ben&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are not here ... they are dead ... If they were captured on the front line ... then they were executed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General!&quot; a journalist insists, &quot;There are South African families who believe the men are still held by Unita.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no one here. We would present them. They are not alive ... they are dead. If they were caught in the front line ...&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General, what is the message I tell the mothers, the wives?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tell them ... we are not sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treatment meted out to the four South Africans captured while mining for diamonds and held at Bailundo for nine months, leaves little hope of survival for the men who have been missing since mid-1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four were tortured for months on end. Bags were placed over their heads so that they did not know where or when the beatings would start or where the punches were coming from. Their thumbs were tied over their shoulders, and their arms stretched for days on end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And mercenaries employed by Unita, general?&quot; the journalist asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have none.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Burundi's Tutsi-dominated military regime was grappling with renewed Hutu rebel attacks on the capital this week as the country's largest political party threw its support behind the insurgents in a struggle it compared to black South Africans' fight against apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours of the announcement the army said rebels had launched a fresh attack near the capital, Bujumbura, which was shaken by mortars and gunfire on Tuesday night. Fighting was also continuing in the north of the country where guerrillas are trying to cut access to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A United States military transport plane evacuated some embassy staff and other expatriates from Bujumbura on Wednesday, but American officials said the aircraft had been scheduled before the latest rebel assault. It was expected to be the last such flight for some time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exiled parliamentarians of the mainly Hutu Front for Democracy in Burundi (Frodebu) have come out publicly in support of the rebel cause saying that since the military overthrew civilian government in July, and banned political parties, there is no choice but to fight. A representative in Nairobi, Joseph Ntakirutimana, said they had given their backing to the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), a splinter group from Frodebu launched after Tutsi soldiers murdered Burundi's first elected and Hutu president three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From now on we are together with the CNDD. We are going to reinforce them because we have the same enemy the Tutsi army,&quot; Ntakirutimana said. &quot;We are fighting a minority system in Burundi similar to what the blacks were fighting in South Africa and it is important that we stand united, we wage the resistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other prominent Frodebu politicians are still sheltering at various foreign embassies in Bujumbura. They include Burundi's deposed president, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who has been a not altogether welcome guest at the US ambassador's residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frodebu's announcement came shortly before renewed rebel attacks around the capital. The army used helicopter gunships and mortars to battle rebels in fresh fighting a day after insurgents dropped mortars on Bujumbura and fired automatic rifles from surrounding hills. An army spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Isaie Nibizi, said the latest clashes were on the eastern outskirts of the city which was ethnically cleansed of most Hutus by the military last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CNDD said the attacks, the most serious on the capital since the coup, are a warning to the army that the rebels can descend from the hills at any time. Although the military tried to play down the significance of the attack by saying there were no deaths and no real damage, the rebels added to the psychological pressure on a city without electricity after rebels sabotaged power lines , and which is also suffering severe fuel shortages because of a regional economic blockade in protest at the coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frodebu's backing for the rebels is a blow to attempts by Burundi's military leader, Major Pierre Boyoya, to isolate the insurgents and win the endorsement of prominent Hutu politicians by promising an ordered transition to a stable democracy and to impose greater discipline on an army heavily implicated in atrocities against Hutu civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frodebu won the presidency and the overwhelming majority of seats in Parliament in the 1993 elections, which much of the Hutu majority viewed as a liberation from Tutsi minority domination akin to the downfall of white rule in South Africa the following year. But after President Melchior Ndadaye's assassination in 1993, Frodebu's power was rapidly eroded by the army and Tutsi establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Tanzanian president, Julius Nyerere, who has been mediating in Burundi's crisis, this week held out the possibility sanctions might be relaxed if Buyoya began a serious dialogue with Hutu opponents, including the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere said the talks are more important than other demands by regional leaders for the restoration of constitutional rule, Parliament and political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Buyoya has so far stood by his insistence that there can be no negotiations until the rebels lay down their weapons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The President of Swaziland's People's United Democratic Movement (Puderno) has withdrawn from a committee set up to write the country's Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mario Masuku listed seven demands to be met among them the lifting of a 1973 decree which bans political parties from operating in Swaziland before he would rejoin the talks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existence of Puderno is currently illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee met for the first time last week to map a programme of action according to terms of reference set out by Attorney General Sipho Zwane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee has been given enormous powers to prosecute anyone who dares to &quot;belittle&quot; or &quot;insult&quot; it including the authority to impose fines of E5 000 (R5 000) or five years' imprisonment or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swaziland Democratic Alliance (SDA), a group of political organisations, trade unions and other civic groups advocating for change, has said the law is meant to intimidate people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SDA Secretary General Jerry Nxumalo said: &quot;People will now be afraid to submit to the committee because of this threat. You will never know what will insult the commissioners, so it will be better not to say anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Jerry Gule, secretary general of the Institute for Democracy and Leadership (Ideal), and also a member of the commission, also expressed his dissatisfaction in the way that the terms of reference were drawn up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ideal feels that the approach being adopted by those so far who have been handling the process is creating unnecessary stumbling blocks. For the process to be transparent and legitimate the views of all the stakeholders in and outside the commission should be accommodated,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-person team, announced by King Mswati III in July, was given two years to draw up a Constitution for Swaziland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Although Zimbabwe's strike by civil servants has been suspended, the threat of renewed labour unrest continues.  The strikers have given the government until September 27 to address problems Plain English which lead to their strike which lasted nearly four weeks the most widescale and costly labour unrest since independence in 1980.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the strike (which economists say cost the country the equivalent of at least R500-million) was at its height, President Robert Mugabe and several of his ministers were out of the country. Dr Edmore Kambudzi, a political scientist at the University of Zimbabwe, said Mugabe felt secure enough to leave at such a critical time because &quot;he has a lot of dead wood at the top, hangers-on whose job it is to make sure Mugabe stays in power. These people control the army and the police.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe displayed his ignorance of the reasons for the strike when he returned home after his Cape Town honeymoon: &quot;I don't understand why the strike is on at all. Government never knew there was a grievance. Those who are striking never told us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lower civil servants, many of whom live far below the bread line, got an average 3% increase just before the strike, while Cabinet ministers, permanent secretaries and their deputies and others got an average 45% increase as well as other perks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike has further dented Mugabe's popularity in Zimbabwe, with foreign donors, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kambudzi explained this by saying: &quot;Mugabe has indicated he may resign before the next presidential elections, so he does not care anymore about serious national problems even though he is doing great harm to the nation.  It will take years to recover from Mugabe's mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - While Pagad is baying for quick justice from blood-stained streets, the police at head office are scrabbling for money to buy a fingerprinting system which would remove one of the key blockages in the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purchase of an automated fingerprint system Afis would speed up police investigations and court trials by up to two months. But the system would cost about R200-million and the police do not, to date, have the money for it in their budget, although it is listed as a priority in draft strategy documents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, their manual fingerprinting service is buckling under the strain of increased crime, arrests and criminal trials: so much so that earlier this year, the police sent letters to attorneys general apologising for delays and explaining the problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter indicates the police are receiving 3 000 new sets of fingerprints daily for processing,. Of all the fingerprint queries it receives, the police say 72% take 20 days to process, 21% take 40 days and 8% take 80 days. Not only are fingerprint checks essential in police investigations, but they are also neccessary in criminal trials where the harshness of sentence is relative to the number of previous convictions of the accused. In magistrate's courts, particularly, sentencing is delayed as fingerprints are checked, with the accused either having to apply for bail or spend up to two months in prison until the records are found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police have almost five million sets of prints in their records to sift through by hand. Afis would cut down the two-month delays to half an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Home Affairs is to tender for an Afis system in November, but this system will not be shared by the police who will have to get their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police representative said the police were also looking at a system where people could be identified by their retina by using a computerised eye-scan for criminals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa won gold at the Olympics and the Paralympics, but there is no medal for our latest title, nor a podium for the proud winner: Nuno Gomes, Deepest Diver in the World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just back from the dolomite crags of Bushmansgat near the Botswana border, he dived to 283,3m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While computerised depth monitors lose accuracy the deeper one goes, the lead-weighted line is a failsafe record. And if anyone walking past Johannesburg's Linksfield Park wondered what two men were doing with a very, very long piece of blue and white ski rope stretched across the field and back last Sunday, it was Nuno Gomes and son Nuno, measuring the record again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes said: &quot;We couldn't lay the rope out flat at Bushmansgat. In Johannesburg we laid it out straight and used a steel surveyor's tape. The figure was 283,3m.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous world record holder, American Jim Bowden, aged 55, plumbed a depth of 281,9m in Mexico's Zacaton cave, so a small difference is vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes, a civil engineer with the Department of Transport, says that if one really wants to compare like with like, the Bushmansgat dive is far more difficult than the two alternative sites: Vacluse in France or the Mexican cave, because they are both close to sea level. But for him the real achievement is being the first to reach the bottom of Bushmansgat ... and survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says: &quot;No one can ever beat that. It's like being the first man to climb Everest. Who ever remembers the second person to get there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the record is solo, the dive was a team event. Gomes has visited the black cavern regularly since 1988, but this latest trip involved seven vital support divers: Craig Newham, 31, computer scientist; Liz Gomes, 42, town planner; Theo van Eerden, 43, police diver; Lionel Brink, 30, computer scientist; Joseph Emmanuel, 29, computer scientist; Craig Kahn, 32, patent lawyer, and Shaun French, 26, a former navy diver and now a paramedic with Medical Rescue International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes himself is 44. He is ecstatic at his success but says: &quot;I will never go again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The physical and psychological stress are simply too much. But probably more important than that is the cost: sponsorship just for gas, valves and batteries on this latest trip was valued at more than R20 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loan of other essential equipment including two compressors and a medical rescue organisation seconding a fully qualified paramedic who was expert at dealing with decompression sickness, Gomes said was &quot;beyond value&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took a week to set up the dive, getting acclimatised to the water and to the inevitable nitrogen narcosis (over-inhalation of nitrogen). Gomes and his teammates dived to 60m, placing cables and cylinders in position. Trailer- loads of equipment had to be sorted, gases mixed and cylinders filled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a previous attempt at the record, Gomes had to stop because he would not have had enough gas for the return to the surface. This time nothing was left to chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had swapped his training location from the murky shallow waters of Johannesburg's Emmarentia Dam for the deeper Bass Lake at Henley-on-Klip. &quot;I practised for hour upon hour, swimming with the huge set of cylinders.&quot; At Bushmansgat, Gomes entered the water wearing seven cylinders that weighed more than he did; two of 18 litres, two of 14 litres, two of 10 litres and one of 4 litres. Attached to these were R10 000 worth of &quot;demand valves&quot;, each taped so that nothing like algae would get into them. Gomes sank swiftly through the sink hole at the bottom of the un-named lake at Bushmansgat into the top of the cavern 51,8m below the surface. From there he plummeted feet first for 15 minutes from the time he left the surface, then turned into a landing position head first and he found himself almost face down in silt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes said: &quot;All our earlier measurements had led me to expect the cave to be deeper than it was. But suddenly the floor of the cave was looming towards me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a cluster of torches under water, it is difficult to see far in the darkness. Gomes managed to avoid landing on a ledge in the cavern, &quot;but I approached the silt like a sky diver&quot;! The silt is as fine as talcum powder and of uncertain depth and divers try to avoid it. But Gomes hit the silt earlier than he had expected and got stuck in the grey powder which remains suspended in the water for hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He couldn't see and he was shivering from the effects of the gases, particularly helium and nitrogen. &quot;I was trying to balance myself on my feet, but I was under quite a lot of nitrogen narcosis and had helium tremors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was little time to think. His lungs were full of carbon dioxide and it was vital to get off the bottom with the minimum of exertion. &quot;It took a long time to inflate my buoyancy compensators because the gas was dense and could not flow easily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Gomes scanned the cave floor, there was no sign of cylinders dropped by earlier divers. Nor could he see any trace of Dion Dreyer, the 21-year-old diver who died in the cave a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two minutes later he was on the return route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two people have died at Bushmansgat. They recovered one body in 1993 but Dreyer's has never been found. All that was found by a remotely operated submersible that was used to search the cavern floor were blind catfish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes took more than 12 hours to return to surface. He started decompressing at 160m in a careful computer-calculated decompression schedule.  From 80m upwards he had shrimps and then frogs for company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reached the surface at night, with no ill effects other than a puffed up face where his skin had been in contact with the water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he rested, he knew he was lucky. Most other divers have died or been partially paralysed in the quest for the deepest depth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomes has achieved the deepest dive in sea, cave or lake without the use of a diving bell. He said: &quot;I didn't want to sit down at 60 and look back at life, thinking that I could have and should have done this dive. For me it was reaching a point where nobody has ever been before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will continue to play underwater hockey and to head the Transvaal Spearfishing Team. And he will back at work at the Department of Transport.  But what goal will he set himself next?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I'll look for a nice shipwreck in the records, somewhere off the Mozambique coast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may find his gold medal yet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - They'll be on opposing sides in the Land Claims Court (LCC) in October, but Basil Davidson and Anwar Nagia agree on a fundamental issue: the Restitution of Land Rights Act of 1994 is flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davidson, chief executive officer of the Cape Town Community Land Trust overseeing the rebuilding of District Six, supports a June application in terms of Section 34 of the Act, under which restitution can be refused if it is in &quot;the public interest&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it succeeds, vacant land in District Six will not be restored to claimants who have applied to the Land Claims Commissioner, but will be redeveloped by the trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application is being brought by the owners of the land, the city of Cape Town and the provincial government. They are paying the legal costs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nagia, chair of the District Six Residents' Association (DSRA), is opposing the application on the grounds that it is expropriation in a different guise, and will further traumatise victims of forced removals. He wants District Six claimants to be allowed to submit individual claims and to be awarded compensation. They can cede their rights to the trust if they wish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davidson is motivated by practical considerations. The trust aims to house 4 000 families in an integrated development on the cusp of the CBD. If Cape Town is in the running for the 2004 Olympics, the building of sports venues will start soon and they would prefer the development to start before building costs rocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is no Section 34 application, land will only be returned to the small minority of landowners and not to the tenants who made up the bulk of the population of District Six before the forced removals,&quot; said Davidson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not denying anyone their rights to claim for restitution, but redevelopment offers a broader benefit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were about 71 000 people living in District Six when it was declared a white area in 1966. The government expropriated 2 375 properties, of which 66% were owned by white absentee landlords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, more than half of the land has been sold and developed. Of the restitution claims already lodged, 28% is for land under existing roads, 18% for land developed by the Cape Technikon, 13% lies under homes erected after the area was declared white and 41% is for vacant land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should the trust redevelop District Six, most claimants would benefit from revenues raised from what is built. The LCC has the authority to grant claimants alternative land if theirs is not available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An underlying problem with District Six is a bigger problem with the Act itself,&quot; said Davidson. &quot;The original Act was drafted for application in rural areas and the drafters tacked on clauses relating to urban Group Areas Act removals without thinking through the procedures. I predict that Cato Manor in Durban will experience the same problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If claimants become more realistic, we can get more participation in the planning of redevelopment. We don't want to ride roughshod over anyone, but we have to start moving soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no alternative to the Section 34 application. It is the only way to make it possible for more of the former tenants to move back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nagia believes there has to be an alternative. He says the Section 34 application has stripped individuals of their rights and made them &quot;ashamed&quot; of pursuing their rightful claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DSRA has been a leading light in the struggle to reclaim District Six.  It was central in the campaign to halt development for white residents in the 1980s, it battled to rename the area District Six after the government changed it to Zonnebloem and it marched on private companies intent on developing the area and forced them to abandon their plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When negotiations started we were told the ANC was fighting for equitable redistribution of land.&quot; But, said Nagia, &quot;We were tricked. Section 34 ...  smacks of the same tactics the government and the council used when they declared District Six white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We represent a wounded community. In the interest of greater participation therapy if you like claimants should be allowed to lodge individual claims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DSRA has held three public meetings since the application was filed in June and has secured power of attorney from 999 former District Six residents to oppose the court action. The organisation has withdrawn its participation from the District Six Development Forum, established by the trust to oversee the planning process for the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nagia is incensed that the trust has chosen to fight the matter in court.  The costs of the application will be paid by the central substructure of Cape Town and the provincial government. Jeremy Gauntlett, SC, will represent them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we want to oppose this matter successfully,&quot; said Nagia, &quot;we will also have to brief a senior advocate and we estimate the legal costs will amount to R300 000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter will probably be heard in October. Davidson is hoping to start planning the new District Six. Nagia is determined to stop him. &quot;If the redevelopment does not have the support of 100% of the claimants, then District Six will remain barren,&quot; he vowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Live And Die In District Six (Sidebar)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebrahim Jacobs says his heart belongs in District Six, and he supports the application to the Land Claims Court because it offers the best opportunity for tenants to return to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs's family was among the last to leave District Six. They were kicked out in 1981 after alternative housing was built for them in Lentegeur, Mitchells Plain more than 25km from the city centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lodged a claim this year with the regional land claims commission on behalf of his parents, who were both born in District Six and had hoped to die there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs is the secretary of an organisation called Concerned Ex-Residents of District Six which represents 900 ex-residents and is part of the District Six Development Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His grandparents, father and mother were born in District Six, and his parents raised their nine children in a three-bedroomed terraced home they rented in Upper Ashley Street. The house survived the demolition of the area, but the street has been renamed Blinders Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not expecting to get our old house back, we know that's not possible, but my parents want to move back to the area at least,&quot; said Jacobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the Jacobs children went to school in District Six, and when the family was moved to Lentegeur, they made a daily trek to school each day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were never happy in Lentegeur. The only good thing about the move was that the families from District Six were all moved together and so neighbours could stay in touch with each other,&quot; Jacobs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the children grew up without the same kind of community spirit there was in District Six and today the area is plagued with gangsterism and crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My family has never felt settled in Mitchells Plain and so when the opportunity arose to claim back our right to District Six, we made sure our claim was lodged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs said his parents had been tenants for all of their lives and would now have purchase a new home in the redeveloped District Six. Their nine children are all committed to assisting financially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My brothers, sisters and I would also love to move back, but we know that won't be possible. My heart is in District Six but the pain of leaving will be eased if at least my parents get the right to live there again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was very frustrating that the redevelopment was now delayed by the District Six Residents Association's opposition to the Section 34 application.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African Broadcasting Corporation journalists, along with about 250 of their colleagues from around the world, were holed up in a compound in Libya this week, unsure when they would be allowed to leave the country to return to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Current Affairs Executive Producer Freek Robinson, a producer, Kotie van Heerden, a cameraman, Trevor Pistorius, and a number of journalists from SABC's external radio station, Channel Africa, had travelled to Libya for the Libyan Independence Day Celebrations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

Robinson confessed to being a little worried about his staff, but said he was comforted by the fact that the Libyans were anxious to promote a good relationship with South Africa. &quot;All the journalists who were there were kept in a compound and strictly monitored The intelligent and they were dependent on the goodwill of the Libyan government to get to the nearest international airport to catch their flights home and that is seven hours away in Tunisia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the Libyan government is making it as difficult as possible so they can make a point that Libyans are suffering because of the ban on international flights to and out of Libya,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journalists were expected to catch a plane to Europe on Thursday and then fly back to Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Independent Catholic church schools which cater for thousands of disadvantaged black schoolchildren will be the first to suffer in the wake of cutbacks in their subsidies by the Gauteng Education Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious and independent schools in Gauteng have been plunged into a crisis by the province's Education Department's sudden announcement of a retrospective 30% cut in their subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since schools get paid their subsidies in four stages during the year, the two remaining pay-outs in September and December will be down-scaled accordingly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six independent Catholic schools are under threat of closure unless a rapid solution can be found to their financial woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the 30% cut remains the same for all schools, the actual value of the cut varies according to the size of schools' individual budgets.  Immaculata High School in Diepkloof, Soweto, for example, will lose R605 000 in the cut, while the Holy Family Convent in Parktown will lose R250 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gauteng's Catholic Education Negotiating Team (Cent) said it had been led to understand an adequate notice of a subsidy cut would be given, to allow schools to plan accordingly. &quot;Coming as it does in the third quarter of the academic year, this makes it almost impossible for schools to adjust their budgets. With a further cut looming in 1997, many schools which serve the poorer black communities will be unlikely to survive,&quot; a Cent spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The schools that are the least likely to survive are those which provide education to black children from disadvantaged communities whose parents cannot afford to pay drastically increased fees. At least four schools in Soweto are under threat of closure within the next year or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these Catholic schools rely heavily on their subsidies from the Gauteng Education Department, in order to make them more accessible to the black community. Cent feels the Gauteng provincial government has no clear policy and has made no attempt to distinguish between elite schools, like St John's College or Roedean in Johannesburg which can better absorb this cut and genuinely deserving cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng MEC for Education Mary Metcalf contends that her department has suffered a budget cut for the 1995/96 financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, Metcalf argues, is there are a greater number of private schools, both church and independent, competing for a slice from a shrinking pie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are short-term options available to private schools facing the crunch this year, according to Metcalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can take their first subsidy for next year this year, or they can convert to a state school. The legal mechanisms are in place for them to change into a public school at their request.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, she says: &quot;If private schools do want to become a public school ...  the ethos of the school will have to be determined by the community. They cannot retain their Catholic ethos unless it is the democratic choice of the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cent claims, however, that the Education Department has already turned down one such request on the grounds that it does not have sufficient funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is possible that a more satisfactory settlement could be worked out in time,&quot; a Cent spokesman said, &quot;but for many of our schools, there is no time.&quot; 'For many of our schools, there is no time'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - African National Congress chairman Jacob Zuma is emerging as a strong contender for the position of deputy president of the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela's announcement that he would step down as ANC president at the organisation's conference in December 1997, and as the country's president in 1999, has paved the way for Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to take over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is broad acceptance of this: in terms of experience and seniority in the ANC, Mbeki stands head and shoulders above any other candidate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only has he been anointed by Mandela as his heir, but his election as deputy ANC president in 1994 made it clear the job was his: in terms of ANC tradition, the deputy president has always become president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it does not follow that whoever becomes deputy ANC president will also become the country's deputy president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a start, it would undermine Mbeki's constitutional prerogative, as president, to choose his own deputy from the ranks of members of the national assembly. It is also unlikely that anyone ambitious enough to want the position would be content to remain in it until Mbeki completed what could be a lengthy term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Mbeki may want flexibility in his choice. If his deputy is there by his own choice, it would be easier for him to effect a reshuffle, in consultation with members of Cabinet, than it would be if the deputy were effectively elected by the ANC conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A scenario under discussion in the upper echelons of the ANC is that it would make sense for Zuma, if elected deputy president, to remain at his KwaZulu- Natal base. Having the former ANC intelligence chief there would be important to counter the impact of Inkatha Freedom Party Chief Mangosuthu Buthlezi actually carrying out his threat of leaving the government of national unity and returning to lead the province. Zuma's elevation within the ANC would also assist him in any contest with Buthelezi for the premiership. In terms of experience and seniority, Zuma would carry the support of large sections of the ANC. If he were to stand, other contenders could see the battle as already won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More pressing for the ANC at present is finding a new secretary general to replace Cyril Ramaphosa. Cheryl Carolus, elected to the position of deputy secretary general at the ANC's 1994 conference, is said to be Mandela's favourite for the post but is understood to be reluctant to take it on if she cannot count on the full support of national and provincial structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It emerged this week that top-level discussions are under way around redeploying some ANC MPs to the national office to provide her with the full- time back-up she needs. If this comes about it is possible that the National Executive Committee will appoint her as secretary general to run the organisation until fresh elections are held at conference in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the National Union of Mineworkers has indicated that it is not prepared at present to release its leader, Kgalema Motlanthe, for the position, this could have changed by the time conference comes around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential aide Joel Netshitenzhe has declined to make himself available for the post. A firm favourite with the ANC Youth League, it is understood he prefers not to abandon ship until Mandela's term ends.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - State-sponsored gangs, who used government patronage to build criminal business empires, featured prominently during Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) sittings in Mpumalanga this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although state support for the thugs officially ended with the dissolution of the security branch in the late 1980s, the commission believes the gangs are alive and still enjoying protection from former security branch members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRC co-chairman Alex Boraine said potential witnesses were so afraid to testify about the gangs that additional police protection had to be arranged at the hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga police superintendent John Nkuna, who was seconded to the TRC in order to oversee the protection of witnesses, refused to comment on investigations into the gangs. He was afraid they would &quot;target me&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in this region are terrified of two groups called Kabasa and Sibaya Esikhulu, who have earned a reputation for assassinating you in some brutal manner if you oppose their interests,&quot; explained provincial Safety and Security MEC Steve Mabona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both these 'businessmen's gangs' and another similar gang in Ermelo, called the Black Cats, are currently being investigated by my special investigation's unit,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Cats gang was the focus of a Goldstone Commission inquiry in 1992 after the Mail &amp; Guardian disclosed that its members had been trained by Inkatha paramilitary fighters to harass African National Congress members in townships around Ermelo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona said Kabasa, which operates around Nelspruit, had adopted its name from Soweto tsotsis who attacked homes and gang-raped girls. He added that the gangs had extensive links with conservative elements in the police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They believe that they're the township untouchables and are primarily criminal in their activities. Kabasa and especially Sibaya Esikhulu (Big Kraal) are extremely well organised,&quot; added Mabona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabasa was formed in 1986 to fight members of the Leaks Youth Movement (Leyomo), supporters of the ANC-aligned United Democratic Front. The gang was run by five heavy-weight black businessmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two gang members, including alleged leader Ex Mkhatshwa, were murdered by unidentified attackers after at least seven ANC youths were killed by the gang during ambushes in KaNyamazane township near Nelspruit. Mkhatshwa was shot dead in 1988, while another member, Lucky Nsimbini, was forced to swallow petrol before being covered with cardboard boxes, doused in fuel and burnt alive. The three surviving gang members apparently still terrorise businessmen, no longer for political gains but to eliminate any business competition in their territory around Nelspruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently two of the alleged members of the gang, Solly &quot;Mabhubesi&quot; Sifunda and P Malumana, appeared in the Nelspruit Magistrate's Court in connection with the murder of an ANC activist from Soweto and a Mozambican citizen in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Tsotsetsi and Mozambican Kenneth Maphemas were killed on separate occasions, but in the same execution manner their hands and feet were tied before three truck tyres were placed around their bodies and set alight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a special court sitting on a Saturday morning, the men were released on R1 000 bail each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigating the case is the head of the Mpumalanga special investigation unit, Captain Fanie Molapo, who played a leading role during recent investigations into third force operations in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the dedication of some investigators, Mabona's greatest concern is the ongoing police protection the gangs still seem to enjoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although declining to give names, he charged that on a number of occasions senior officers totally unconnected with the relevant investigation had stepped in after the arrest of gang members and had ordered all charges be dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are parts of the police which are horribly corrupt. Senior officers interfere in cases they should have no interest in and even travel 200km from Middelburg to Nelspruit to ensure charges are dropped,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just last week, the special unit arrested a hitman in KwaZulu-Natal who is used by Mpumalanga businessmen. A senior officer managed to get the man out on bail on a small charge after he was initially denied bail on 10 counts of murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona also expressed his concern that despite almost 100 cases linking policemen to the Black Cats gang, the investigation had apparently been frozen by its new police supervisor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Kabasa member testified before the TRC, although one gang member, who started a church and declared himself a preacher, claimed during a service two weeks ago that he would use the commission to clear his name.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - At this week's Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) hearings in Johannesburg, everybody wanted to appear historically disadvantaged. However, at least some of their dreams of tragic heroism were a little far-fetched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three consortiums bidding for Highveld Stereo, the plumpest slice of regional radio currently being auctioned by the SABC, were throwing a lot of cash around. We're talking big bucks here: hundereds of millions of rands, powerful businessmen, well-rehearsed presentations and ruthless attempts to discredit the competition were all part of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The snarling bidders were given one day each to astonish the IBA decision- makers. Everyone put their best foot forward and hopscotched as daintily as they could around their inquisitors. Their main objective for six hours each was to appear to the great and good councillors like well-balanced angels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their manners were impeccable, their attitudes reverent and their tastes in suits said as much about them as their bids: David Blood Associates,R60- million, petrol blue polyester mix; Worldwide Consortium, R130-million, black mandarin collared cotton; Newshelf 63, R320-million, pinstripe double- breasted wool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the bidders, raising huge amounts of cash was one thing. Meeting an array of politically correct criteria was another. The main cause for panic was undoubtedly the IBA's dreaded &quot;suggestions&quot; regarding the &quot;historically disadvantaged&quot;. The HD catchphrase became the string of rainbow coloured fairy lights that strung together every proposal. For black entrepreneurs, historical disadvantage was a Godsend. For those with the money, historical disadvantage was a pain in the butt. (Super-rich Primedia 40% shareholders of Newshelf and 100% financers of the R320-million bid, were entering the arena of democratic privatisation for the second time in as many weeks and they looked frazzled by the process.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA criteria made creating the perfect applicant an excruciating exercise in super-slick casting for all bidders and to this end extraordinary consortiums were formed. Dozens of historically advantaged men leapt into bed with anyone black, left-wing or female. Black-owned Rainbow Investments were given a 25 % shareholding in the David Blood bid free of charge. Black- comprised Zerilda Investment has a 60% shareholding in the Newshelf bid. This is not a gift. Primedia will loan their partners the bulk of their capital requirement at a rate above prime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blood's offer to his black partners would have looked generous by comparison if only he had any money. Unfortunately, what Blood thought was a guaranteed loan of R60-million from Absa turned out to be nothing more than a conditional declaration of intent fom Messrs Hercules du Preez and Henk van der Merwe at the bank. They will guarantee the loan only once Blood has secured ownership of Highveld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide Consortium was the only Highveld bidder that could boast proportionate investment representation with no share crossover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The straining to fulfil the the IBA criteria had been stressful for the bidders, but facing the razor sharp IBA panel seemed worse. The first to meet the shredder was the David Blood consortium ... well, just David Blood really.  The scene was a sorry one. A couple of opposition players wafted through the auditorium early in the day, but soon left. Fortunately, the remainder of his audience, comprising a few tired journalists and a one-legged Smal Street wanderer, was seated behind him. However, Blood's view of a twitchy John Matisonn, deadpan Dr Sibeletso Mokone-Matabane, ratty Peter De Klerk and astonished Lyndall Shope-Mafole was unobstructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of Blood's black partners turned up and he didn't have R60-million, but his main problem seemed to be an inability to fill out the application form correctly. His proposed station was in fact &quot;music driven&quot; rather than &quot; full service&quot;, his consortium's legal status was questionable and for anything he wasn't sure of, he simply left a blank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Worldwide Consortium didn't leave any blanks. When they had finally seated their panel of six and three rows of spectating lawyers and investors, what faced the IBA looked formidable. Welcome Msomi, Michael Markovitz, Joe Makobe, Phutuma Nhleko, Rina Broomberg, Tuli Zuma. Mostly black, mostly male, sometimes hip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of the auditorium swelled with Newshelf opposition. (Blood did not attend.) Stan Katz of Primedia/Newshelf looking very rich, strode in and grinned smugly at the Worldwide Consortium. David Dison representing Worldwide looking like Stan Katz the younger, grinned back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testosterone - the kind with money - clogged the air. There was much cocky, sumo-like psyching out from both sides, and the contact sport of handshaking was rife. The Worldwide panel, deprived of eye-contact with Newshelf, looked like they were about to don New Zealand rugby shirts and start puffing at John Matisonn instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly there was a flash of light as an overhead projector was flicked on.  The Worldwide Consortium presentation was about to begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were pie charts and breakdowns and bullet points of every description.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide had all the right stuff money, lots of non-tokenist historically disadvantaged investors, struggle backgrounds, solid businessmen and Welcome Msomi, whose light, anecdotal presentation even softened Sebiletso's stare somewhat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lone female seat was filled by Rina Broomberg. Although only employed by Worldwide as a consultant at present, Broomberg conducted a lengthly presentation which seemed to indicate that she may end up running the station single-handed. Her claims of expertise in the fields of training, management, programming and social work paled only next to her ability to spot radio talent from a distance of 30 paces. (A veteran of 702, Broomberg listed Stan Katz among her recruitment successes.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide also had Michael Markovitz and David Dison in their corner. Even Newshelf's objections which were raised at the end of the Worldwide punt were laughed off. All Worldwide's ducks were in a row, all their transparencies were in order, but when it came to question time, the panelists began to squirm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy is not always a teddy bear and IBA councillors don't clap after neat presentations. Instead they pick arguments apart and spot contradictions as easily as if they had red flags poking out of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They threw out several seemingly simple questions about sexism and programming that froze the panel. Broomberg's view did not seem to satisfy the council on gender issues and the affable Mr Msomi was caught so off-guard by the aggressive questioning regarding content, that he nervously declared that all the songs to be aired on the station would be sung in English perhaps even the French ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After lunch the Worldwide panel were more composed. In fact Matisson's possibly ambiguous reasons for asking why Worldwide thought the IBA should even consider a bid R190-million less than Newshelf's far from unsettling the panel, gave Markovitz an opportunity to hold the moral highground for several minutes on what he believed the IBA was there to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newshelf's hearing started 30 minutes late. The foyer thronged with Primedia/Newshelf supporters. Worldwide was present but not overbearingly so and David Blood was standing around, being ignored by the big boys. Apart from the usual male component, there was also a scattering of pretty young ladies in suits and nail polish. As they had not appeared before, it can be assumed they were part of the Newshelf camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time the hearing began, the auditorium had been transformed into corporate heaven. Newshelf/Primedia family friends and loyal employees filled virtually every seat in the room. Archangel Katz looked as pleased as punch, and humbly took his seat near the edge of the bidder's table. The Newshelf Chair was filled by labour lawyer Kuben Pillay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to be outdone by Worldwide, Newshelf's presentation was supported by computer generated images that flashed and shifted and boasted a team of 17 at the bidders' table, nearly as black as Worldwide's panel, with Albert Luthuli's granddaughter Nomhle Gcabashe possibly tipping the scales of political correctness in their favour. They were showing off a bit, but they did look impressive in a corporate sort of way. The presentation was mostly tedious and the rhetoric was embarrassing but when it was Worldwide's turn to lodge their objections, ennui was not their beef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide lawyer Derek Rabin voiced a cluster of objections which seemed to open a can of worms so foul that even Newshelf winced for a while. Worldwide scrutiny of Newshelf's shareholder's agreement which had only reluctantly been made public on August 23 exposed an alarming degree of non-democratic control over just about every aspect of Newshelf by Primedia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly all Newshelf's silver clouds appeared to have charcoal linings. If the objections could be sustained the IBA would be hard pressed to grant Highveld to Newshelf, without making a mockery of themselves, the Act, the new South African way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katz pulled at his chin, the Newshelf chair mumbled to colleagues either side of him, and the Primedia lawyer fumbled nervously with a clumsy hand- held microphone before deferring back to the chair, without doing anything but giggling. &quot;Er ...&quot; stammered Pillay, &quot;Could we break for lunch now?&quot; A roar of laughter went up from the audience, and lunch started 10 minutes early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 2pm a chortling Worldwide contingent took their seats as did a shell- shocked Newshelf. It was now the IBA's turn to winkle out the truth. Lyndall Shope-Mafole was especially inquisitive and Primedia initially stumbled through most of their answers on labour, training and profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But somehow, by the end of the gruelling session, they had largely managed to escape the web of horrors which their own documentation had spun for them and even a very nervous Chris Gibbons (Primedia director) looked slightly less in need of a Rennie than he had done an hour earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA councillors are no fools. A nation's desire for diversified airwaves ownership lies in capable hands. Theoretically, all three bidders stand a chance of winning Highveld, but if it goes to David Blood, black listeners will probably number 0 within a week and news time in minutes per day will total 5. A Worldwide win might have Rina Broomberg running everything and possibly trying to hire Stan Katz. And should Newshelf get it, judging by their labour- loving presentation, then the cleaning lady will be in charge and gum-boot dancing at tea-time willl be compulsory subject to approval by Primedia of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bidding For A Licence To Print Money (Sidebar)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When it was announced that the SABC was to sell six of its regional radio stations everybody cheered. Government rubbed its hands in anticipation of receiving a huge whack of much needed revenue. Potential bidders were finally in with a chance of becoming rich as well as famous.  Even the public agreed that 70 years of listening to turgid, conservative airplay was enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these are not the only things in the sale's favour. What industry could be more honourably privatised than the monstrous broadcaster of Nationalist propaganda not to mention Afrikaans pop music? This, combined with it's unfashionable legacy as a monopoly, made it imperative the auction be conducted with impecable political correctness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the SABC is the seller, the final decision regarding a buyer lies in the hands of the democratically endowed IBA. The selling off and opening up of the airwaves is the biggest privatisation deal this country has seen since Iscor was sold off in the 1980s. The stakes are high but IBA involvement should ensure no automatic triumph for the highest bidder and no depressing tales of corruption as a consequence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first round of bidding for three of the six prime, established radio stations came to an end on Wednesday in Johannesburg. The bidding started off in Cape Town a fortnight ago with Newshelf 63, Crescent Consortium and Moribo fighting for control of KFM. Next to come under the hammer was Natal's East Coast Radio bid for by Dynamo Investments, New Radio Consortium and Moribo Consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&amp;G Media, owner of the Mail &amp; Guardian, is associated with the New Radio Consortium which bid for Radio Oranje as well as East Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's Johannesburg hearings saw another clash between Newshelf and Worldwide with the third bidder being David Blood Associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakes are high and the bids range from R11- million from Free State Media for Radio Oranje to R320-million from Newshelf for Highveld Stereo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The booty is precious, and any businessman worth his weight in feathers knows that to have a stake in one or more of the stations is more than a licence to say &quot;hello mum&quot; to millions at will it's virtually a licence to print money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the process has been a non-sexist, non- racist highly democratic one, for a non-refundable fee of R30 000 anyone could be a player and for a few dozen million rand on top of that anyone could be a contender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most controversial bidder is undoubtedly Newshelf. The consortium which is 40% Primedia owned and would be almost 100% Primedia controlled, has made them an easy target. Should Newshelf win the bid for Highveld it would effectively mean that Primedia, which already owns 100% of Radio 702, could hog almost half of Gauteng's adspend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As regards the possibility of Newshelf winning both its regional bids as well as its two new radio licences, its competitors have raised objections on the grounds that this could become a monopoly in the making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A valid concern in the sense that it would then control three up-and- running, adspend-rich radio stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, if all goes well, in six months' time there should be 46 new radio stations in Gauteng alone. With people like Richard Branson as probable competitors, some healthy competition and consequent spreading of adspend jam would be ensured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vetting of bidders as regards labour relations has also thrown light on Primedia shortcomings in this regard, and therefore the possibility of mirrored problems for Newshelf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When John Matisonn asked Stan Katz of Newshelf whether 702 employees were union members, Katz replied that they were not, as there had never been any need for such membership. This is not quite true as some 702 journalists have been warned against becoming union members, and the reply prompted a smile from Matisonn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having said this, between the IBA and fellow competitors little dirt was dug up on most applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the SABC and government have agreed to accept the decision of the IBA as final regarding winning bidders. But this too is not yet a fait accompli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legally, as current owners, the SABC could refuse to accept the IBA's decision. It would be a scandal. It would be a slap in the face for the entire democratic process, but if Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Jay Naidoo et al are faced with a difference in price of R190-million for one station alone, they just might buckle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - More than 28 000 cattle valued at about R75-million have been stolen in the Eastern Cape this year as organised syndicates increase their supply of cut- price meat to the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several farmers have thrown in the towel as the cattle-rustling figures have already doubled what they were for the whole of last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 35 highly organised syndicates which specialise in supplying illegal meat to townships and unscrupulous butcheries have been identified by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arresting the culprits has proved almost impossible for anti-stock theft units as most of the meat has already been bought by the township clientele before the beasts are slaughtered. Even if meat is found, linking it to a specific carcass or crime requires costly DNA testing. Police say that often by the time a crime has been discovered, &quot;the evidence has already been eaten&quot; . Farms hardest hit by the cattle-rustling often border on the townships.  East Cape regional anti-stock theft co-ordinator Superintendent Richard Smith said this week &quot;90% of all kills end-up in the townships. These groups are so organised that they already have customers waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very difficult for police to investigate because most people in the townships are too scared to inform, for fear of getting their throats slit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, Smith said the theft of stock belonging to township residents was negligible as most culprits &quot;are scared of getting caught and killed&quot; by the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several farmers bordering the townships say although the police &quot;try hard&quot;, they are fighting a losing battle against the rustlers. Ecna</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - On November 17 the public will be able to scrutinise a special register concerning MPs' financial interests. MPs, senators and President Nelson Mandela himself will have to detail earnings, gifts and other benefits on special forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows the adoption earlier this month of the Code of Conduct in Regard to Financial Interests. A Committee on Members' Interests, chaired by Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal, was set up this week to supervise the implementation of the code.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-member committee consists of nine African National Congress members, two each from the Democratic Party and National Party and one from the Pan African Congress and African Christian Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of their first tasks will be to encourage members to comply. &quot;Members will have to know this is not an attempt at policing them, but an exercise in good governance,&quot; said parliamentary official Kamal Mansura. &quot;We will need members' co-operation to get it off the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee decided two forms would be circulated to members. One would involve details to form the public part of the register, while the other would cover information that will remain confidential. Gathering information will start on September 16 with a deadline of October 16. A month later, interested members of the public will be able to learn about members' shareholdings (market value will be confidential), outside jobs (remuneration will be confidential), directorships and partnerships (remuneration confidential), consultancies, sponsorships and other benefits (value confidential). Members will also have to disclose all gifts worth more than R350 received since May 21; details of land and property held (information about private homes will be confidential), pensions (value confidential) and foreign trips except private visits, party-paid trips and business trips unrelated to their role as MPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone entitled to be present and take part in Parliament's proceedings is covered by the code, which is why Mandela will be among those making a declaration. The rules also cover members' spouses, permanent companions and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only the Committee on Members' Interests will have sight of the confidential part of the register. While the committee will be able to hear complaints behind closed doors, it has a duty to publish its findings as well as a summary of the facts. Members who contravene the code can be fined up to one month's salary or be suspended from Parliament for 15 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary official Peter Lilienfeld, who will serve as registrar until the committee appoints one, said it was possible the public register would be made available on the Internet as well as being open for scrutiny in Parliament.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A number of African National Congress ministers are trying to breathe new life into the Masakhane Campaign by making Deputy President Thabo Mbeki its new figurehead. Mbeki will promote payment of rates and taxes, as part of the drive to create a &quot;new patriotism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative from the Constitutional Development Ministry, Mpho Msmane, said Mbeki would be taking political responsibility for Masakhane, although the programme would be driven from within the Constitutional Development Ministry under Minister Valli Moosa. The second thrust of the campaign, he said, was to persuade provincial premiers to drive the campaign regionally from their offices. Meetings with premiers are under way.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Masakhane campaign, launched last year, failed to convince citizens to pay their rates and taxes. It was a campaign planned and driven by former housing minister Jo Slovo, constitutional development minister Roelf Meyer and minister without portfolio Jay Naidoo, all of whom left their portfolios, leaving Masakhane in the hands of their successors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Msmane believes the first launch of Masakhane created a national profile for the campaign, and now was the time to really bring its message home. He said that the media had mistakenly emphasised the payment of rates and taxes as the only element in the campaign. There were other strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about teaching people civic responsibility,&quot; he said. &quot;It's about ending the Eighties culture of destroying state assets because they were part of the apartheid system. It's about telling people that they must report on criminals for the sake of the community. It's about teaching people to take ownership of their communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents on the revitalisation of the campaign urge officials to put the payment of rates and taxes in the right context. Other aspects that need to be introduced are social partnerships between communities, businesses, civics and municipalities, and the promotion of local economic development.  The document concludes with these words: &quot;Masakhane is a call to all South Africans to build the country through unity and solidarity. There should be efforts towards dealing with previous divides by developing programmes ...  that will promote the new patriotism. Racism and ethnicity have to be eradicated through a new consciousness and value system that promotes equity and justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Payment of rates and taxes, however, is crucial to empower newly elected local governments to deliver the services the ANC promised in the 1994 elections. The momentum for the revitalisation of Masakhane has its origins in Shell House's policy unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although decisions have been taken behind the scenes, a memorandum is being drawn up on the campaign for Cabinet approval. Msmane said a great deal of consultation with communities needed to take place before the revitalisation campaign was officially announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Reconstruction and Development Programme monitor Gavin Lewis believes Mbeki will be flogging a dead horse: &quot;I just don't see this campaign working unless they have a secret formula ... or perhaps they set measurable targets for the provincial premiers and say they must answer to Mbeki should they not reach the targets. Otherwise it just becomes a woolly feel-good picture. The previous campaign failed; the picture of non-payment is a dismal one.&quot; (Pic: Thabo Mbeki)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - They've been described as student radicals, and they've certainly got the T-shirts earned during careers which took them from student activism to jail, exile and working underground for the African National Congress. But Billy Masethla, the new head of the South African Secret Service (Sass) and Barry Gilder, his deputy, would prefer to have themselves seen as &quot;democratic spies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their appointment brings the former comrades-in-arms full circle: they once worked together briefly in Botswana. Masethla, now 41, landed there in 1979 following his release from jail after helping as an underground ANC operative direct the uprising unleashed by events in Soweto in 1976 and reorganising the student movement, helping launch the Congress of South African Students and the Azanian Students' Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilder, now 46, served a term on the national executive of the National Union of South African Students (Nusas) before heading for London and ANC membership in 1976. He joining Umkhonto weSizwe and the ANC's department of intelligence and security (DIS) in Angola in 1979. He headed DIS in Botswana from 1983 to 1989 and served with Masethla on the regional political and military council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had the struggle not intervened, Masethla might have become a teacher; instead, he was trained in military combat work in Angola, specialising in intelligence and counter-intelligence and completing an intelligence officer's course in the former East Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilder, blessed with a rich baritone, was known for the political songs he wrote and performed at Nusas congresses. In exile he got involved in cultural politics, helping stage the Culture and Resistance Festival in Gaborone in 1982, before undergoing guerrilla training, specialising in intelligence, in the former Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He doesn't sing in public anymore, he says, &quot;Except in the bath when I have time to have a bath. It was impossible to keep up singing underground, apart from entertaining comrades in safe houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His and Masethla's training different in style and content to that undergone by South African intelligence agents under the old order has advantages, Gilder says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The training those of us in the ANC got in the former Soviet Union and East Germany, seen in relation to the training my present colleagues from the old order got, stands us in good stead as a service. We now have the best of both worlds.&quot; Their mission, defined by the changed realities of post- Cold War geo-politics and South Africa's transition, involves refocusing Sass. The old &quot;them and us&quot; paradigm no longer applies: national security today is defined less in military terms and more in terms of the full range of political, economic, military, social, religious, ethnic and technological factors that shape security issues around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closer to home, they have to oversee the cementing together in Sass of the various contrasting attitudes and styles of operating that the amalgamation of operatives from the liberation movement, the Bantustans and the old secret service has brought about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our biggest challenge is to change the focus and direction of Sass. The amalgamation brought to the party people who targeted each other in the struggle. That basis for intelligence has gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masethla's wealth of experience in political intelligence and organisational work are said to stand him in good stead for this. &quot;He is a very energetic person, very disciplined, with good leadership skills and a commitment to measured, achievable transformation,&quot; said an intelligence source. &quot;Despite his background, he is able to carry all sectors of the service behind him which is a very necessary skill in this period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, new legislation passed this year has set up a range of checks and balances none of their predecessors ever had to worry about. Said Gilder: &quot;This means we have to change how we behave and how we collect intelligence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described Sass's role as providing the government, which now has completely different information requirements, with &quot;the kind of intelligence it really needs and that will make sense to it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presence of foreign intelligence services had &quot;increased quite dramatically&quot;, he said. &quot;South Africa has become the pet interest of many countries in terms of trade and economic opportunities and political influence in Southern Africa and Africa. The bigger powers are keen to know what makes us tick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our strategic goals, in broad strokes, are to effect a transformation where we can change the nature and conduct of intelligence so as to be able to provide this new government with the intelligence it needs to conduct foreign policy and trade effectively with other countries and to watch out not only for dangers, but also for opportunities for the country.&quot; (Pic: Gilder) (pic:Masethla)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Caught between the rock of its abolitionist principles and the hard place of a constituency ravaged by crime and clamouring for revenge, the African National Congress seized control of the death penalty debate this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recommendation from the ANC's crime summit last weekend asked its leadership to &quot;consider reconsidering&quot; its long-standing opposition to the death penalty. Senior ANC MP Carl Niehaus moved quickly this week to &quot;clarify&quot; the resolution as little more than a recommendation to the ANC's National Executive Committee to &quot;consider whether we need to re-examine our position&quot;, but added that a &quot;positive outcome of the debate could be a move to restate the ANC's arguments against the death penalty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Niehaus noted that &quot;once the initial hype settled down, there has subsequently begun to be a serious debate on the issue&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sharp contrast to the recent focus on opposition campaigns for the reopening of the gallows, most major newspapers this week rallied behind the hard- won campaign which closed the door on executions last year. Human rights groups rallied behind their sacred principle, and the ANC's most vocal abolitionists dusted off their ammunition to launch a counter-offensive against &quot;knee-jerk responses to crime&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Human Rights registered its &quot;disappointment&quot; at the ANC's call to reconsider: &quot;It is difficult to imagine how the reintroduction of the death penalty will in any way assist the police, the justice system or the penal sytem in dealing with crime,&quot; said LHR national director Jody Kollapen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International expressed dismay at the possible volte face: &quot;South African society cannot be further brutalised by institutionalising state- sanctioned murder. The death penalty is the gravest form of human rights abuse, and the ANC should not be deterred from its course of human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Amnesty report on the death penalty suggested South Africa would be bucking the global trend away from capital punishment if it reversed the current status quo: 100 countries worldwide have either outlawed the death penalty or have not used it since 1985. Only four countries have reintroduced the death penalty in the past decade of these four, Nepal has since reabolished it and The Gambia, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines have not used it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's most celebrated death row survivor, Magoo's bar bomber and Deputy Director of Foreign Affairs Robert McBride, rallied behind the party's abolitionist stance, saying pro-hanging arguments represented a &quot;jump in logic&quot; for communities reeling from the crime wave. &quot;I've never come across a death row prisoner who thought at the time he committed the crime that he'd be hanged. Even in the heydey of apartheid, when they were hanging 167 people a year, crime skyrocketed. The real problem is that criminals know they won't be caught,&quot; McBride said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other ANC leaders argued that the death penalty provided no solution to the crime wave. &quot;There's no proof that it acts as a deterrent even in developing countries unless you're talking about an authoritarian society,&quot; said ANC MP Blade Nzimande.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC justice committee chair Johnny de Lange said the debate had diverted attention from the &quot;real issue of the transformation of the justice system&quot; which the party had begun to tackle at the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the summit's decision to &quot;acknowledge&quot; the public outcry in favour of hanging including public opinion polls placing support for hanging at about 70% and indicating substantial ANC grassroots support for the death penalty ANC leaders this week swiftly countered opposition calls for a referendum on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party, Inkatha Freedom Party, Freedom Front and some Democratic Party leaders said they were in favour of a test of the electorate, but ANC leaders stood firm in their belief that &quot;some issues cannot be subjected to the vagaries of public opinion&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nzimande said: &quot;If we were to hold a referendum on every contentious issue, this country would be nowhere. If we had subjected the Government of National Unity to a referendum, it would never have been accepted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McBride argued there were other equally contentious issues, like land reform, over which nobody demanded referendums: &quot;If we called a vote on land reform, most people would demand the immediate return of land that was taken from them under apartheid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial and Constitutional Affairs Ministry spokesman Mpho Mosimane warned that any attempt to chip away at the human rights culture enshrined in the Constitution's Bill of Rights could have a &quot;ripple effect&quot; on other rights. A return to the death penalty would require the removal or amendment of the right to life clause in the Bill of Rights, but &quot;other rights, such a abortion, may also be affected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If we were to hold a referendum on every contentious issue, this country would be nowhere'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Paul Ekon, the flamboyant young multi-millionaire who hosted Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's 50th birthday party, had a bizarre legal skirmish with a former Robben Island inmate who Ekon claimed accused him of drug dealing and hit-squad involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has recently emerged that Ekon (36) brought a R500 000 defamation action against African National Congress member and ex-political prisoner Peter-Paul Ngwenya in August 1994, but withdrew it 10 months later, days before the scheduled Rand Supreme Court hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papers filed by Ekon's lawyers claimed Ngwenya had said Ekon &quot;is a drug dealer&quot;; that Ekon &quot;worked with (former Security Police chief General) Basie Smit with a hit squad&quot;; and that Ekon &quot;was associated with the Robert Smit murders&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngwenya, a corporate relations specialist, denied in responding court papers that he had made the allegations. But the Mail &amp; Guardian understands &quot; warnings&quot; about Ekon who had befriended a number of top ANC leaders, possibly already before the organisation was unbanned in 1990 were circulated in the ANC at the time. Leaders were informed about an internal background check on Ekon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngwenya this week confirmed details of Ekon's defamation claim against him, and of its last-minute settlement. Ngwenya said he made no apologies and gave no undertakings: Ekon withdrew the suit and partly refunded his legal expenses. &quot;My feeling is he knew if it came to court he couldn't afford the negative publicity ... I was quite prepared to defend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G last month reported Ekon's claim to have co- sponsored Mbeki's 1992 birthday bash with two friends, &quot;ANC tailor&quot; Yusuf Surtee and clothing industrialist Charles Priebatsch. Both are on good terms with top ANC leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon's claim came after axed deputy minister Bantu Holomisa charged that hotel magnate Sol Kerzner had paid for the party, among other favours to ANC leaders. Mbeki broke his silence to confirm Ekon's version. But Holomisa, citing &quot;privileged information&quot;, maintained Ekon had only acted as a &quot;go- between&quot; for Kerzner. The party, attended by Kerzner among others, was held at Ekon's plush Houghton home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions remain about the circumstances in which Ekon who is friendly with Kerzner and dated Kerzner's ex-wife Anneline Kriel in the early 1990s left South Africa last year to base himself in London. Ekon said he left because of a &quot;business opportunity&quot;, denying he was the subject of a police investigation relating to foreign exchange irregularities or trade in precious materials. Ekon last month told the M&amp;G he had called ANC lawyer Ishmail Ayob, who in turn would have elicited an assurance from Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi that he was not under investigation. Ayob confirmed he acted for Ekon &quot;in commercial matters&quot;, but said: &quot;It seems to me you have something in your mind that is so big that the minister (Mufamadi) is involved ... Ministers don't deal with such matters ... Logic will tell you you don't pick up the phone to ask the minister, 'Are you looking for my client?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon also referred the M&amp;G to a letter lawyer Kobus du Plessis had written on his behalf a year ago to the South African Police Service, Interpol and the Witwatersrand attorney general's office. Ironically, Du Plessis's firm of attorneys, David H Botha, Du Plessis and Kruger, has also represented former Civil Co-operation Bureau (CCB) operatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter says in part: &quot;It is common cause that our client is presently resident in London, England, mainly due to business obligations. His intention remains to return to the Republic of South Africa as soon as possible, notwithstanding any possible police or other investigations against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Notwithstanding rumours and/or allegations ... it was confirmed to advocate E du Toit by your Mr Herman de Beer (of the attorney general's office) that our client is not currently a suspect in any criminal investigations, nor is he needed for any questioning ... Client confirms your Mr De Beer's confirmation that no warrant of arrest has been authorised against him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngwenya this week said Ekon's defamation claim resulted from discussions he had in July 1994 during talks on a significant &quot;black empowerment&quot; initiative for South Africa. The deal, which was driven by European interests and Ekon, and which in principle had the blessing of the ANC, later collapsed. During the course of the talks, he had been asked for a reference on Ekon, which he gave after making inquiries in the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngwenya said Ekon asked Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale to mediate on the court action. A meeting with Ekon ensued, during which Ekon offered to withdraw the defamation claim in exchange for an apology. Ngwenya refused, saying he was prepared to meet Ekon in court. Court papers show a settlement of the matter on June 19 last year, two days before the scheduled hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon was not available for comment at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This Friday sees the South African release of Crash, a movie so controversial it has not yet been News, features, released in the United States or the other services United Kingdom. Local distributors Nu-Metro are leading the international market with computing their bid to release the film completely uncut, but with a &quot;no-under 18&quot; (sex, nudity, violence) restriction, in limited cinemas across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nu Metro's decision was taken with extreme caution in the light of the fact that, three months since its award-winning premiere at the Cannes film festival, the film has yet to find a distributor in Britain. In addition, its American distributor, Fine Line, has put its release on hold until early next year after receiving an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. The harshness of the rating means that, as in the past, a portion of America's media will refuse to place advertising for the film.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Directed by Canadian David Cronenberg and based on a 1973 novel by British science fiction writer JG Ballard, Crash, which tells the tale of an underground cult which derives erotic pleasure from car crashes, created controversy from the outset. The film won the Special Jury Prize at Cannes but only after the jury was split down the middle and, after even lengthy discussion, remained divided. Eventually, the jury chair, Francis Ford Coppola, swayed the decision to give the award with his own vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to Britain's refusal to release the film, Ballard has lashed out at distributors for displaying &quot;timidity and triviality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, in the latest issue of Sight and Sound, a leading British film magazine, editor Philip Dodd says, &quot;To deny (Crash) will be to risk denying space for a whole range of 'difficult' movies, in which case Britain peculiar or not will be a much less interesting place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film-maker himself is far more direct, quoted on his home-page on the Internet as saying, &quot;Censors tend to do what only psychotics do ... they confuse reality with illusion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The realities of the South African release will only be clear after this weekend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Some of South Africa's top business leaders come under fire in a new book on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission co-authored by Water Affairs Minister computing Kader Asmal which fingers companies which supported apartheid. Reconciliation through Truth, soon to be published by David Philip, makes a strong case for the truth commission to seek testimony from company bosses who either supported apartheid or whose corporate practices trampled human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The text recalls pro-apartheid statements from men such as Gavin Relly, who took over the helm of Anglo American when Harry Oppenheimer retired in 1982.  Relly said at the time he, like Oppenheimer, did not favour &quot;one man, one vote&quot; as that &quot;would simply be a formula for unadulterated chaos at this point in time in our history&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors quote Oppenheimer's official biographer, Anthony Hocking, who said the magnate &quot;never subscribed to the view that apartheid was morally wrong. In his view, it was at root an honest attempt to cope with overwhelming racial problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rembrandt head Anton Rupert, now a member of the influential &quot;Brenthurst Club&quot; which advises the government on economic issues had similar views: &quot; After many African countries became free they got dictatorships like Idi Amin's. We have to find a solution that won't end up giving us one man, one vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors Asmal, his wife Louise and Trinidadian lawyer Ronald Roberts show that in the 1960s big business had been even more open in its support of Pretoria. In 1967 the South Africa Foundation, whose members included Oppenheimer and Rupert, said in an advertisement in the Sunday Times that ns should stop apologising for apartheid and instead &quot;substitute a tone of confident self-assertion which publicised the opportunities of apartheid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1971, the foundation claimed its propaganda efforts had helped to &quot;stem the tide of ignorance, criticism and misrepresentation against the republic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Asmals and Roberts say South Africa's truth seekers have so far not broached the idea of &quot;corporate war criminals&quot; like Japan's Kajimi Gumi company, tried in 1945 for using war prisoners and kidnapped Chinese civilians as labourers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the authors hint there is much light to be shed on the details of corporate connivance in apartheid, they signal the collaborating companies themselves were aware of the substance of their &quot;crimes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the late-middle 1980s, Anglo American directors privately discussed the fear their company would be remembered as the IG Farben of apartheid, a reference to the company that, through slave labour, became the industrial backbone of the Third Reich,&quot; they write.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors also accuse South Africa's mining giants of exploiting the migrant labour system, killing more than 69 000 workers in the past 94 years, and boasting of the availability of cheap apartheid labour to international investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the book implies the Truth and Reconciliation Commission should pay more attention to the corporate world's connivance in apartheid, it does not examine the sensational but unproved claims by human rights campaigners and lawyers that some companies indulged in &quot;dirty tricks&quot; operations claims which would be ideal material for any truth commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most celebrated of these allegations is that Sasol used KwaZulu police hit-squad operatives trained in the Caprivi Strip to help quell strikes in the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Goldstone Commission on &quot;third force&quot; violence, witnesses alleged that nine former Caprivi trainees including a man called Xesibe who was in charge of the trainees were dispatched to Secunda, the hub of Sasol's sanctions-busting synthetic fuel operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MZ Khumalo, Mangosuthu Buthelezi's right-hand man, told the commission at the time that they were sent as &quot;ordinary labourers&quot;. Asked how he could reconcile this explanation and the decision to send Xesibe to accompany the men, he said under cross- examination: &quot;The atmosphere was very tense in the mines and all the places at the time and I was anxious about keeping control of the group that they did not get involved in any of the violence that was taking place there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In written argument presented to the commission, lawyers cited evidence from Bongeni Khumalo that a Sasol official had on several occasions asked MZ Khumalo to organise men to act as strike breakers and that MZ Khumalo had personally selected Xesibe and the others to attack strikers. The commission was also presented with a letter sent to the KwaZulu Department of the Chief Minister, in which Khumalo referred to the secondment of Xesibe to Secunda for &quot;my project&quot;. However, a Business Day article quoted Khumalo denying that Sasol had used KwaZulu police members as hit men at Secunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission is unlikely, at this stage, to hold any hearings on human rights abuses committed by various companies during the apartheid era.  Harry Oppenheimer 'never subscribed to the view that apartheid was morally wrong'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - &quot;Even as we do theology, we should be careful not to be too critical of our religion (Christianity) because we will find ourselves with nothing to fall back on for spiritual comfort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Theology is 'God-talk' (the study of religions and religious beliefs) and therefore you can't put parameters to the nature of theology. The fear of being critical is grounded in the fact that the 'God-talk' is necessary and must go on. We are not out to tell people what is to be believed - that is done in the Cathedrals!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So went the debate between a Kenyan participant and the pioneer of the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians (CCAWT), Dr. Mercy Amba Oduyoye, during the Biennial Institute of African Women in Religion and Culture held in Nairobi, Kenya from August 26 to 31,1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former argument is typical of the fact that in the African context, it would be both misleading and inadequate to discuss theology without dealing with the question of spirituality. For one, to the African, religion is not a theory, it is a way of living; meant to help people with their everyday life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For about two decades now, theologians and committed lay persons have shared the passion for an &quot;African Christianity.&quot; Experiments are indeed taking place in theology through the likes of Dr. Mercy Oduyoye's brainchild, the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians-something that could be termed as a genuine challenge to the churches in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formed in 1989 in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians is faced with the task of promoting women's theological education in Africa - 'feminist theology'. The organization aims to encourage African women's theological authorship and reflect on the influence of religion and culture on the lives of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uniqueness about this body is that one not only has to be a woman to fit in but must also submit a paper on African theology before she can be considered for membership. Unlike most feminist organizations that are geared towards the overall liberation of the woman right from early childhood, the CCAWT is an academic group that meets to identify issues for debate, criticises them and is open to criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Oduyoye, women's spirituality is qualitatively different from men's in that the former's experience of socio- economic realities differs from the latter's. Similarly, women's dependence on religious beliefs, practices and ritual is more intensely demonstrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Ghanaian, Dr. Oduyoye argues that when women read the Bible, they often hear what is unheard by men. Therefore, women's theology originates from a different depth. She justifies feminist theology with the argument that the reception of liturgy and women's reaction to it is shaped by societal expectations and their experience of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it about gender sensitive language in liturgy? Because when Rev. Martha Ngugi, the Christian Education Secretary for the (Anglican) Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) was called upon to offer a prayer for the opening ceremony of the pan-African conference, she began thus; &quot;God our Mother, Mother of Hagai, Sarah and Rebecca..&quot; This is indeed promoting the inclusion of specifically women's concerns in the theory and practice of evangelism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Musimbi Kanyoro, one of the coordinators of the Circle and the Executive Secretary for the Geneva-based Women in Church and Society Programme of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), said although feminist theology is all about causing theology to look different, there is an urgent need to recognize sexism as a sin that needs confession and repentance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that the theme of the conference was Transforming Power; Women in the House of God, one would be quick to imagine that the governing discussion would be women in direct involvement in church leadership and decision making.  But a diversity of issues that hamper women's development were tackled - capacity building, conflict and crises resolution and politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The merging of Christianity and politics caused a stir among the women theologians as most of them were of the opinion that the two cannot mix - &quot; politics is a dirty game,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mrs. Tabitha Seii, a renowned Kenyan woman politician and Christian was most emphatic that appearing on the rostrum to give a political address does not &quot;subtract your Christian faith.&quot; She told the African women theologians that they can still render support to politicians by voting and encouraging them in the &quot;Christian light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contribution of the CCAWT will be to conduct research projects which would unveil positive and negative cultural factors, religions and myths that affect women's lives, and more importantly introduce &quot;bare-foot&quot; theology intended to cater for the grass-root woman so that she can interpret the Bible and religion better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women theologians were overly concerned about the inclusion of women's studies in religion and culture in the research carried out by institutes of African studies at universities or the continent and other tertiary institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Oduyoye proudly reported that Trinity College in Ghana has incorporated women as full-time students at the college. The same can be said of Bishop Tucker Theological College, Mukono in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We confess our failures, frailties and imperfections, including our past acceptance of violence and injustice in relations between men and women,&quot; says the women's creed, a composition of the women theologians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nearly 100 participants drawn from over 15 African countries, most of them directly involved in church leadership and over-ridden by feminist emotions, noted that violence against women is any gender-based act which causes physical, sexual or psychological suffering to women, compromising their gifts or diminishing full expression of their dignity and humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians challenges African churches to cease activities which pose the danger of being too comfortable and permanent instead of re-thinking about evangelization in depth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - In a book launched late August, Groaning in Faith: African Women in the Household of God, African women theologians from Eastern and Southern Africa have challenged the African church to address its discriminatory attitude towards women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 282-page book, edited by two renowned Kenyan women theologians - Dr.  Musimbi Kanyoro and Dr. Nyambura Njoroge, also criticizes some African traditions that continue to discriminate against women while claiming to be promoting cultural values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book approaches the African woman, church and culture from a social, cultural, economic and theological point of view. This is presented in 25 well researched papers written by African women theologians under two distinct -- cases. Women's Participation and Inclusiveness; Searching the Scriptures and Women's Well-Being in Culture and Religion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her paper, Groaning and Languishing in Labour Pains, which is also the opening chapter of the new volume, Dr. Nyambura J. Njoroge, says African women and men are called to confront the injustices that are sweeping across the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if we decide to remain silent, she cautions, the crises are too great to be ignored. She adds that the waiting has lasted too long and the sufferers are too many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan theologian who is the Executive Secretary Programme for Women and Men in Partnership, at the Geneva-based World Alliance of Reformed Churches (WARC) refers to the Bible to drive her message home. Quoting Jesus Christ in John 16:21-2, Kanyoro says, &quot;When a woman is in labour, she has pain, because her hour has come. But when the child is born, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world. So you have a pain now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing from a South African perspective, Sharon Potgieter regrets that despite the fact that women comprise 70 per cent of the total church population, &quot;they are usually absent from its decision-making bodies and hierarchies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two thousand years since its inception, the church is engaged in heated debates concerning the question of women's involvement or non-involvement in the first-century Christian community, she laments in her article, Church Praxis and Women Who Remain Within the Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Potgieter, attitudes towards women are based either on the position that the early church community was egalitarian and shared leadership roles, or on the position that patriarchy was entrenched in clearly delineated gender roles that prevented women from full participation in all spheres of church life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potgieter from the University of Western Cape, South Africa, says the South African church is not in any way ready for ordained women. And because of this situation, the task for women clergy remains awesome. &quot;The church appears to have failed in its attempt to liberate its male clergy. Women, both laity and clergy, will have to address this issue fervently if things are going to change at all. They will have to emerge from the closet to tell their own stories, which is an act of courage and of love, she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her contribution entitled, Women's Priesthood in Relation to Nature, Kenyan woman theologian Mary N. Getui says the church in Africa can hardly claim to have a real ordained woman in the vineyard. The few who have been trained in theology, she says, find it difficult to be ordained. &quot;The fewer who have been ordained can hardly carry out their duties because of the many obstacles they face, simply because they are women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the senior lecturer at Kenyatta University, also highlights biblical examples of women, who were good servants. These include Mary Magdalene, Phoebe, a deaconess of the church; Anna, the prophetess; Deborah, the champion of God's people against their enemies; Esther, the mediator for her race; and Judith, the saviour of Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On women in the Kingdom of God, Ugandan theologian Jessica Ketura Nakawombe says the cry of women for a more participatory and inclusive church and community emanates from their longing for a church which is more human. It is responsive to the prophetic role it has to play in the midst of the suffering humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a demand, to set the ecumenical house in order, to strip it of its hierarchical and crippling institutionalism, so that it can be a movement of concerned men and women engaged in a mission of healing and reconciliation.  The church is reduced to its bare institutional framework, both by men and women, argues the Ugandan graduate of Bishop Tucker Theological College in her paper, Women in the Kingdom of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing on Women's Dignity and Worth in God's Kingdom, Ada Nyaga, a doctoral candidate in Feminist Theology, San Francisco Theological Seminary, says the gospel cannot be a gospel of women at all unless it tries to change the oppressive structures that give them such a poor self-image, especially single parents. As long as the traditional church retains its traditional attitude by regarding single parents and their children with ignorance and contempt, the gospel will remain a hindrance to most women and children, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on The Veil: A Feminist Theological Analysis, South African graduate student in theology Sa'diyya Shaikh, says any study on the veiling of women, would be incomplete without reference to the manner in which it has been appropriated by the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism in the 20th century.  In terms of contemporary political analysis, Islamic fundamentalism can be seen as a response to a complexity of factors, she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the subject, God Calls to Ministry: An Inclusive Hospitality, Kenyan Dr. Musimbi Kanyoro laments that many churches preach an inclusive gospel, but find it difficult to link that with an inclusive church. Women are crying out for full partnership in the church, she says. There cannot be full partnership unless the churches re-evaluate and change the traditions and structures which tend to relegate women to the home and certain tasks considered to be women's work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kanyoro, who is the Executive Secretary Programme for Women in Church and Society at the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), Geneva, says Christian women have experienced the special vision of their worth and calling to discipleship as partners with men in all areas. The church is the place to which women can turn and ask for solidarity in identifying values and structures which stand in the full realisation of their worth and dignity in the service of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that women blame themselves for seeking self-promoting if they speak out, and those who speak out are branded such names as &quot;feminists&quot; which to many church people mean &quot;a bad woman,&quot; Dr. Kanyoro points out that &quot;most women suffer in silence. They fear that if they speak out, they would lose respect and embarrass themselves and their churches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kanyoro in her contribution blames the socio-economic and political conditions of our continent for killing our people. &quot;We are dying from injustice, war, disease, murder and physical and spiritual hunger,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her article, Women and Taboo, Olivia Nassaka, a church worker and teacher in Mityana Diocese, Uganda, argues that in the light of Jesus's words, there is an urgent need to set free African women from oppressive taboos.  Taboos, which dehumanize and hinder the well-being of women, she says, should be discouraged, while those that enhance the well-being of women should be encouraged to suit with the times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article, Widowhood in Zambia: The Effects of Ritual, talks of women's sufferings even before their husbands have died. Says author Mulambya P.  Kabonde, a parish minister in the United Church of Zambia, in some cases they may have started planning their futures in preparation for what might happen in the event of their husbands' death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is very practical, because when they are bereaved it may be impossible to think properly. Wives with children think deeply about the future. With the high cost of living and school fees to pay, widows with young children hardly have any peace of mind, she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Religion and Women's Health, Kenyan Hazel O. Ayanga points out that most women in Africa experience low nutritional levels. About 42 per cent of these women suffer from nutritional anaemia, while 51 per cent of pregnant women in Africa have a blood count of less than 11g/dl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS/HIV), the author says religious and cultural teaching on the place of women in society means that a woman may continue to be the recipient of the virus because so many religions, be they Islam, Christianity or traditional, require a woman to obey her husband in all matters. This means that the woman cannot say no to sex even if she knows that her husband has tested HIV-positive, explains Ayanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayanga in her paper says, Christianity and Islam have so far been unable to provide women with clear and unequivocal guidance on what to do if their husbands are HIV-positive. She advocates a religion that helps educate society on how best it can be made whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her article, The Kenyan Church and its Role in Women's Sex Education, Josephine Gitome from Kenyatta University is of the opinion that if the church constituted sex education for its congregation, it would create an invaluable forum for discussing issues and problems, and women would learn their rights and be able to defend themselves against sexual harrassement within the church and society in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The launching of the book, presided over by Ghanaian woman theologian and author of several books Dr. Mercy Oduyoye, coincided with the second pan- African conference for African women theologians, held in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi from August 26 to 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more than 100 African women theologians drawn from 16 African countries met under the auspices of the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians (CCAWT) debating the subject, Transforming Power: Women in the Household of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The occasion also witnessed the launching of another book, Violence against Women, a case study of the Kenyan woman from a religious and cultural point of view. The 85-page book, edited by Kenyan theologians, Grace Wamue and Mary Getui, discusses several sub- themes under the main subject.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A cure is yet to be found for HIV/AIDS. But as scientists and researchers continue to search for a curative drug, trends show increased prevalence among rural folks, who arguably are more vulnerable to fake treatment. Hence the need for more awareness and education programmes.  Meanwhile, from Benin comes another herbal invention from a Ghanaian herbalist who claims to &quot;completely clear&quot; all AIDS symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike other concoctors of drugs and herbal mixtures, who have publicly announced they have discovered a cure for the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), there are no frantic or anxious crowds at Haurana Ogoungbe Appiah's doorstep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has not gone fully public. In any case, his operational base is in one of the least affected countries on a continent where AIDS is believed to be rampant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet from his headquarters in Cotonou, capital city of Benin, Haurana, 42, treats AIDS patients with a concoction, the AKPU, that he calls &quot;the anti-HIV herbal mixture,&quot; which the Ghanaian government's reputable Centre for Scientific Research into Plant Medicine (CSRIPM) has passed as safe for human use. Other Ghanaian herbalists have used, or more categorically abused, such certification of safety to claim government approval of the therapeutic efficacy of their concoctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haurana claims that of the few patients he has treated in Benin some have been referred to him by medical doctors trained in the rigid and strict Western tradition. The same is true of other patients treated at a clinic in Ashiarman near Tema in Ghana, run by his eldest brother Toussaint Ogoungbe Appiah, 48.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Toussaint and especially Haurana remain cautious because &quot;treating AIDS is very complicated.&quot; You deal with both the disease and the mind of the patient as well as with his or her relatives and friends, says Haurana. He is &quot;still researching&quot; further into the efficacy of the mixture and related reactions, after which &quot;I will go fully public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But security also worries him. He cites Nana Drobo, another Ghanaian AIDS herbalist who was shot by unknown people about two years ago. Drobo who drew crowds to his house,was llegedly able to cure AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of Haurana's fear is people's &quot;unrealistic anticipations of 100 per cent results&quot; with herbal treatment, especially where AIDS is involved. &quot;The same is not true of modern medicine and patients continue to die in hospitals when their time has come but relatives and friends do not complain.&quot; Hence the need for caution and security, for which he has written to the Government of Benin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other countries such as Malawi, Uganda, Zambia and Ghana itself, thousands of patients literally stampeded to claimants who said they had found a cure for AIDS. Mostly from the more highly affected countries, a majority of claimants have been traditional healers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few of these &quot;inventors&quot; in countries such as Kenya, Uganda and Zaire have been medical doctors or conventional researchers. Yet others have been fanciful dreamers inspired by visions that come to them in sleep or otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately for the patients, a majority of these claimants have been proved liars, consciously or unconsciously. A few have been found to be crooks out to make a quick buck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even more damning, none is known to have willingly offered their concoctions for analysis for subsequent clinical trials. Nor have they disclosed the composition of their mixtures or other drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other than water, Haurana too will not disclose the nine ingredients that make up AKPU. He is, however, prepared to accept &quot;any serious and honest analyst or analysis that will not take credit or any other accruing benefits from me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently he admits his mixture can only but &quot;completely clear all symptoms&quot; . However, the &quot;cured&quot; patients do not convert to HIV- negative status as medical tests have shown. Saying that this was a step in the right direction, he claims that none of the patients treated with AKPU for the last two years have shown any recurring symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, some of the patients like Antaru Awudu of Ashiarman have not only recovered but are also &quot;now strong enough&quot; and have resumed their normal economic activities, he claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An interesting aspect of Haurana's treatment is that he insists on patients producing copies of the results of their HIV-positive status for those who have them. He then fills out his own treatment forms that clearly indicate the patient's complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also points to the appetite boosting side-effect of his medicine that is taken three times a day after meals. &quot;Appetite is good especially for AIDS patients and they should eat each time they feel hungry.&quot; He recommends less sugar and oil or none at all and no alcohol or tobacco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a treatment form, among the patients he treated around August last year was former Benin soldier Bruno Ediko Gbessou, who went public on television in December of the same year to announce he had AIDS. And as for a woman patient, 38, at Akpakpa Dodome, a poor suburb of Cotonou &quot;if it wasn't for this man (Haurana) I would be dead by now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman's elder brother jovially testifies to the claims. The brother contacted Haurana through Haurana's first cousin with whom the brother works at an oil company in Cotonou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born of a Ghanaian mother, Denise and a Beninois father, Albert Ogoungbe Appiah, Haurana is the third in a monogamous family of nine children. The family lived in Ghana until about 11 years ago when the elder Albert Agoungbe returned to resettle in Benin with his Ghanaian wife and some of the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two sons have since settled in Italy and England respectively, while Haurana came to Benin about five years ago. One sister is married in Cote d'Ivoire. It is the son in England who led APS to Haurana . The family is strictly Catholic and boasts of one nun belonging to order of the Sisters of St. Augustin in Benin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Haurana was later to convert to Islam not long after dropping out of school to join Toussaint, the eldest of Albert Agoungbes's children, in trading in motor vehicle spare parts. Though, as he admits, he left school because of illness, &quot;unknown voices frequently&quot; told him not to return to school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years the same voices over which he prayed a lot as he does with his medicine returned to him. They urged him to look for a cure for AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are characteristics easily identifiable with an unstable mind. Yet Haurana for all practical purposes seems a very steady man with a stable family background, and a steady family of his own consisting of a wife and three children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is either genuine, simply a smart crook or a confused man who may be afflicted himself,&quot; one skeptical government official told APS. Haurana, however, insists he is genuinely interested only in alleviating the suffering of people. To prove his case, he allowed APS to take a sample of his medicine for &quot;any testing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A research officer of the CSRIPM at Mampong-Akwapim, about 50 kilometres from Accra, told APS that AKPU was tested only for its toxic safety, a facility the research centre offers to all herbalists. About 70 per cent of people in Ghana and elsewhere in Africa depend on herbal medicine. This makes the CSRIPM which operates under the Ministry of Health an important arm of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research officer, a British trained pharmacologist with a masters degree, explained that of the AIDS herbal medicines they have tested for toxicity, on further investigations two have shown some therapeutic efficacy, but only in laboratory tests so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for AKPU like all other herbal mixtures, &quot;further work needs to be done on them in order to examine their therapeutic safety and effectiveness and to provide grounds for assessment of possible measures to be introduced before conducting clinical studies.&quot; The centre normally directs herbalists with introductory letters, to two national research laboratories for such further investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most, however, do not take this rather lengthy follow-up action &quot;because they are not researchers who are normally very patient. Instead, herbalists are too eager to prove their worth and make money,&quot; the research officer noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps it is time herbal medicine was taken more seriously and preliminary (as the CSRIPM is doing) and further tests carried out in all African countries. Herbalists already abound on the continent,&quot; he further said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the absence of a cure and given the prohibitive costs of modern AIDS drugs, argued the researcher, treatment with herbal mixtures should be allowed provided patients know they are not a tested cure or remedy for AIDS.  &quot;Meantime AIDS awareness and prevention must be intensified especially in the rural areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA - The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA)-Uganda has denied any role in the alleged death of &quot;many pygmies&quot; at the ADRA camp in Bundibugyo District, Western Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The denials by ADRA follow charges that the relief agency had played a role in shifting pygmies from the Semliki National Park - their forested natural home environment to Sempaya camp in Bundibugyo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late August, Ms. Christine Aporu Okal, a Ugandan Member of Parliament representing women of Kumi District in eastern Uganda, claimed that she had worked for ADRA in western Uganda and that &quot;many pygmies&quot; had died at their Sempaya camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ADRA country representative for Uganda Doris Jorgensen said she did not know how many pygmies had left the forest but noted there are 68 pygmies in Bundibugyo District. &quot;ADRA never asked anybody to come; those that came I suppose did so willingly,&quot; she commented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not think the pygmies are dying in or outside the camp - there could be natural causes of death even when you stay at home,&quot; noted Jorgensen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She accused park and government authorities of &quot;looking for a scapegoat.&quot; She said leaders in Bundibugyo had given land to the pygmies whom park authorities had evicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Booker Ajuoga, a senior employee of ADRA-Uganda emphatically denied that ADRA-Uganda had at any time employed one Christian Aporu Okol (i.e. the MP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to APS on telephone, he charged that those who had consistently fabricated charges against ADRA had flagrantly ignored a record that speaks for itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the agency's work in the area, Ajuoga explained; &quot;We look at pygmies as fellow human beings and work hand in hand with them. We invite APS to come and see our work and talk to the pygmies themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ajuoga said he believed the root of the crisis was that the forest dwelling of the pygmies was dwindling all over western Uganda. Pockets of pygmy communities are to be found all over the border region of Uganda with Zaire and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ajuoga believes there are fewer than 2,000 pygmies in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other communities of pygmies live across the border in Zaire and Rwanda particularly the Ituri forest of Zaire. The pygmies of these areas have been affected by the influx of refugees from trouble-torn Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILE - The Congolese government has banned all 15 private newspapers and magazines in this Central African country and ordered the seizure of all copies of the published papers following a government decree mid-August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, private newspapers and magazines disappeared from bookstores and newsstands and the population has to make do with the state run radio, television and one bi-weekly bulletin as sources of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has accused the media owners here of violating a new press law passed on July 2 which requires all non-governmental media and publishing houses to obtain a commercial licence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law includes provisions from a previous law which required media houses to submit to the Attorney-General's office a declaration including the objectives of each newspaper or magazine, its title, where and how often it is published, its price and the name and address of its publisher. This law was hardly enforced in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister for Communication and Democratic Culture, Albertine Lipou- Massala reportedly ordered the media houses to comply with the new law within ten days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She charged that some newspaper owners had in the past given false information while others had not provided the names of their publishers and the address of their headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She urged the press to conduct itself &quot;properly&quot; since there were &quot; important events ahead&quot;, a reference to French President Jacques Chirac's expected visit to Congo; the pan-African Music Festival (FESPAM) and the National Day on August 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During this period nothing will be tolerated,&quot; Ms Lipou-Massala was quoted saying, adding that the new law would be &quot;rigorously enforced.&quot; Many Congolese link the timing of the crackdown to FESPAM which is an annual event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it flops, it will be taken from here and the venue will be switched to Cameroon or South Africa. The government knows that the press is very critical, even biting. I think that is why they have kept the papers off the streets,&quot; said one citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, publishers have reacted strongly to the banning and confiscation of the publications. The publisher of Presence Economique, a new newspaper observes: &quot;I just can't understand that there are no papers in a country that is celebrating its 36th independence anniversary and which is hosting the FESPAM, instituted by the Organization of African Unity (OAU).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He points out that although he has &quot;everything they asked for&quot; his publication was not exempted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am registered with the Attorney-General's office. They asked me to have a commercial licence, but here is a memo which says that entrepreneurs have until September 15 to get the licence. &quot;I went to see the Attorney-General and the minister to find out what is going on since I complied with the requirements, but no one was able to tell me anything,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security agents are said to have made off with all 2,000 copies of Presence Economique, each of which costs about one US dollar to produce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Himbou deplores the loss adding that the situation is made worse by the fact that this was their first issue. Some of the publications have threatened to sue the government but according to a lawyer consulted on the matter, &quot;it would take over a year for any court to overturn a state decree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time of going to press there were no new developments on the government decree.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - Safety and Security Minister, Sydney Mufamadi has scheduled a meeting with media editors to discuss the controversial Section 205 of the Criminal Procedure Act under which a number of media organizations have been subpoenaed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, National Police Commissioner George Fivaz, said the subpoenas might be reviewed in consultation with the Attorney General concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement on August 23, Mr. Mudamadi said he was optimistic the meeting would address the complex issue of Section 205 to the satisfaction of all parties involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A subpoena served in terms of Section 205 allows police to demand information from individuals who face imprisonment if they refuse to give it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to The Citizen of August 24, Mr. Mufamadi said he hoped Justice Minister Dullah Omar, then attending the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Council of Ministers' meeting in Lesotho, would be able to attend the meeting scheduled to take place in Cape Town the following week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subpoenas were served to obtain information on violence in Cape Flats involving members of the militant Muslim group, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAGAD is blamed for the attack and subsequent murder of Rashaad Staggie, leader of a most feared drug-dealing group, the Hard Living gang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police served subpoenas on three Cape Town daily newspapers, Die Burger, The Argus and Cape Times, on Associated Press and the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the South African Press Association's Cape Town representative, Francois Krige, would also receive a sermon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting in Cape Town on August 23, representatives of the organizations decided to resist the Section 205 orders as a united front with all legal means at their disposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Compliance with the terms of the subpoenas would amount to a contravention of the basic constitutional rights to the freedom of the press,&quot; they said in a statement, adding that they would not hand over the material sought by the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAPA would support this stance if Krige was indeed subpoenaed, editor Mark van der Velden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Fivaz said he would request a meeting with editors, Attorney- General and their interested parties to discuss the application of Section 205.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will therefore recommend and if acceptable, request a meeting with media editors, media unions, Attorney-General and other stakeholders,&quot; said the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues he wished to discuss included a possible review, in consultation with the Attorney-General concerned, of all present Section 205 orders against members of the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Directing police to proceed with subpoena against the media only on the direct authorization of an Attorney-General, should also be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other topics listed by commissioner Fivaz for the meeting were:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Issuing interim directives to South African Police Service structures to exhaust all other investigative and information avenues before requesting the Attorney-General to sanction Section 205 applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Initiating discussion with Attorneys-General to achieve a shared approach to the issue of Section 205 orders against journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Fivaz said the issues raised after serving the subpoenas had to expeditiously defused and addressed in the interest of the credibility of both the media and police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While broad cooperation between the media and the police was vital to fight crime, police in a democracy could not expect the media to compromise their independence. They should not become mere extensions of the investigative capacity of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nevertheless, Section 205 is a legitimate judicial instrument and a vital tool in fighting crime in general,&quot; Commissioner Fivaz said. &quot;But it is clearly necessary to re-examine its practical application to specifically the media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Town meeting of representatives of the three newspapers, two news agencies and SABC resolved, as a united front, to expose the Section 205 subpoenas with all the resources of the law at their disposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group said its opposition was based on two fundamental issues; the safety of journalists and the public's interest in the free operation of the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the first issue, it was stressed that journalists would face serious threats to their own safety if their neutrality in reporting events was brought into question. Journalists could not be seen to be instruments of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, the media could not function if it did not enjoy the trust of the public. This required a clear separation of the functions of law enforcement agencies and the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group said its stance, therefore, concerned fundamental matters of principle as well as practical security concerns. Legal advisers believed the court would not uphold the subpoenas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Correspondents Association urged Justice Minister Dullah Omar to rescind the subpoenas. &quot;We believe the subpoenas violate the new constitutions's guarantee of freedom of the Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We fear that they will have an immediate and chilling effect on the gathering of news, and will endanger the lives of independent journalists who may now be unfairly seen as agents of the police,&quot; said the association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Institute for Democracy in South Africa (IDASA) said police investigating actions by vigilantes on the Cape Flats should have other sources apart from journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It should be noted that although the police do have a right to subpoena witnesses in their investigations, this right should not be extended to members of the media when engaged in their activities as journalists,&quot; said IDASA Executive Director Wilmot James.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Media Workers' Association of South Africa (MWASA) came out in support of the stance by SABC not to cooperate with police until the SABC's position had been formulated. MWASA said that Section 205 &quot;has no place in a democratic dispensation and it must go now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI - For the second year running, banner waving Catholics from various dioceses in Kenya on August 31 ululated and clapped at a prayer service in Nairobi's Uhuru Gardens as a bonfire consumed heaps of condoms and sex education materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the Catholic Church in Kenya, Maurice Cardinal Otunga denounced sex education and warned the Ministry of Education against introducing the subject through the backdoor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cardinal condemned the books that were set alight for advocating the use of condoms without emphasizing the need for abstinence and self control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last three years, the Catholic Church in Kenya has campaigned vigorously against sex education in schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In neighbouring Uganda, the Auxiliary Bishop of Kampala Dr. Mathias Ssekamanya has hit out at married couples who use condoms and practise artificial family planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a service to celebrate &quot;married people's day&quot; at Gayaza near Kampala late August, Bishop Ssekamanya said: &quot;It is very wrong for married people to use condoms because it means one of them is cheating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also warned such couples that experience had shown their conjugal life was threatened by such practices. &quot;Any time it will come to an end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Ssekamanya said the Catholic church considers natural family planning the best solution since it posed no danger to the woman's health. He said the church in Uganda had established natural family planning centres countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Anglican Bishop Misaeri Kauma, the Chairperson of Uganda AIDS Commission, has advised married couples to use the condom where one of the partners is infected with HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A condom has no position in God's sight,&quot; said Bishop Kauma at a workshop on AIDS held in Makindye, a suburb of Kampala, late August. &quot;However, for purposes of positive living, it is important to use it in order not to infect a partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Bishop Kauma I say be faithful to your partners, we advocate complete abstinence until you are married. But as Chairman of Uganda AIDS Commission, I say use a condom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bishop said he had lost a son and a daughter-in-law to the HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and warned the youth, especially girls to be watchful and avoid men who tempt them &quot;with such things as lifts in cars.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KYEBI, GHANA - The undue emphasis placed on money collection in the church is diversionary and ought to be stopped, Rt. Rev. Anthony Antwi Beeko, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ghana (PCG) has charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He regreted that 'although the Synod decided in 1993 to stop the 'Appeal for Funds' directed at exhorting money,&quot; the practice still goes on in some churches. Rt. Rev. Beeko was addressing the 67th Synod of the PCG held here late August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;When we therefore divert attention from the glory of Christ to the collection of money, then our emphasis is misplaced, distorted and the rhythm of the church's life is disrupted.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an earlier but related call, Mrs. Esther Hamilton, Headmistress of Apam Secondary School, charged that churches complain about abject poverty in society, yet did not initiate programmes to alleviate it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the 25th Anniversary of the Apam St. Joseph's Catholic Choir, Mrs Hamilton urged churches in Ghana to demonstrate their support for the needy by not collecting money from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She criticised the mode of silver collections in churches where every member on a pew is compelled to make a donation. Instead, she called for a system that allows only those who can afford to donate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an interview with APS, Fr. Anthony Kornu, Assistant General Secretary of the Ghana national Catholic Secretariat (GNCS) insisted that the practice of donating to the church was &quot;more voluntary than compulsory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless Mrs. Hamilton was referring to specific circumstances or contexts, said Fr. Kornu, her sentiments were contrary to practice and the general view of most Christians, particularly those of the charismatic tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Parish councillors and other Christians complain that the church was neither steadfast nor zealous enough in educating its followers to pay their biblical 'tithe' and other dues,&quot; he said. But inspite of such complaints, stressed Fr. Kornu, the church did not insist on the tithe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formerly taken as a form of tax to support the church and clergy, the tithe represented a tenth of the annual produce of land or labour that every faithful was obliged to pay to the church. In modern times, this would require followers to pay one tenth of their annual &quot;net income&quot; to the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fr. Kornu said that bishops have repeatedly spoken against &quot;enforced tithe, which in the Bible related to a particular and historical context that did not obtain today.&quot; He said the church was &quot;even softening on mission dues&quot; depending on individual circumstances, in preference for &quot;comfortably affordable donations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a familiar tone, the assistant parish priest in the area, Rev. Fr.  Luis Hamilton called on Christians not to allow economic hardships to distract them from God. &quot;Hardships,&quot; she said, &quot;should strengthen your faith in the Lord who is the giver of all things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from her criticism of the church on money collection and alleviating poverty, Mrs. Hamilton praised the choir and its role in the mission of the church. She observed that songs were an important alternative form of communication through which Biblical messages could b e conveyed to the public with great impact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young girl who has lived with her parents in the UK for the past eight years has sought help from an older cousin who is seeking the assistance of charities in London to help her prevent the girl from being &quot;destroyed for life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Kingdom-based charity, Foundation for Women's Health Research and Development (FORWARD) has taken up the issue of female genital mutilation (FGM) among African immigrants in Europe, and is mobilising worldwide opinion to eradicate the practice within 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it's vice chairperson Adwoa Kwatreng Kiuvitse remains doubtful, the organization says it has taken the first steps in its million mile journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main types of FGM include circumcision - the least common but mildest type of mutilation in which the hood of the clitoris is removed; excision-the most widespread form of mutilation which includes the partial or total removal of the clitoris and labia minora, and in some cases the labia majora; and infibulation-the most brutal, involving the removal of the clitoris, labia minora and at least two-thirds of the labia majora. The sides of the vulva are then pinned together by silk or catgut sutures or thorns, a tiny piece of wood or reed is inserted to leave a small opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 80 per cent of FGM's occur in Africa where 6,000 girls a day are estimated to be at risk. FGM is more common in the Horn of Africa, where in Somalia for example, 99 per cent of women are said to be affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sierra Leone, 90 per cent of women are at risk but in Uganda and Zaire, the figure drops to five per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laws of varying severity prohibiting FGM have had little impact because mothers, grandmothers and relatives who underwent FGM themselves continue to insist on its practice. Those supporting it say it is purely a cultural issue, a path those who practise must be left to tread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whether or not this path is to be regarded as ideal has become an international issue. And as worldwide campaigns to end genital mutilation in Africa intensify, it is becoming clearer that the practice is more widespread than initially thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, whereas, some campaigners in Europe had expected to involve literate African females to support the need to end the mutilation, &quot;it is sad that some of the more educated women in Africa are helping to entrench the practice,&quot; says Jennifer Wilde of a UK charity fighting to end FGM among African girls in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An increasing number of African migrants in Europe has highlighted the issue over the past few years. Its practice was outlawed in the UK in 1985 but health workers estimate the number of children at risk has risen from 10, 000 to 13,000 since then, yet no complaints have ever been brought to the authorities under the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights activists in Europe say over a million girls are known to have died from the practice. In the UK alone it is estimated that over 13,000 girls are at risk. This figure represents young girls from Somalia, Ethiopia , Sudan, Kenya and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though some African women in Europe argue that the practice is cultural, women worldwide are beginning to see it as torture. As a result, Amnesty International has thrown its weight behind the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Hannah Yambasu, AI's Women's Officer in Sierra Leone, her organization's involvement to abolish mutilation &quot;is not about interfering in African culture, this is about protecting children from torture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Sierra Leone, Christians as well as Muslim women are mutilated, but the church is too scared to speak out against the practice for fear of losing its believers. There is no religious law, neither Christian nor Muslim or any other, which say women must undergo female genital mutilation,&quot; she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hannah who was herself mutilated at the age of 10 says traditional reasons such as suppressing women's sexual behaviour and initiating them into womanhood has proved invalid. &quot;FGM is supposed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to reduce a girl's sexual appetite, but many women are being forced into prostitution because of the (civil) war and most of them have been excised.  But they are more prosmicuous because they have no sexual feelings and sex means nothing to them...,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some observers say in Sierra Leone the practice has become a political tool where candidates buy votes by arranging and paying for the girls of entire villages, whose parents otherwise could not afford to have them initiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adwoa objects to claims that FGM is not an issue for Westerners to address.  I think it is just ignorance which has prevented Westerners from getting involved,&quot; she says. &quot;They were afraid of being branded racist for disrespecting other cultures. But FGM is not cultural or traditional, it is removal of a healthy organ; this is a harmful practice endangering children's lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adwoa says it is not possible to estimate the number of girls who die worldwide after FGM but says it could be millions. A three- month-old daughter of Malian parents bled to death in France in 1982 after a traditional excision. Her parents were charged with criminal negligence and given suspended sentences.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI - There is growing concern about the low literacy levels among Muslim women throughout Africa because of the stereo-type idea that women are &quot;the wheels and captives&quot; of their husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was expressed by the Women's Desk Consultant of the Project for Christian-Muslim Relations in Africa (PROCMURA) Rev. Dr. Janice Nessibou during the August 26 to 31 pan-African conference for women theologians in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Dr. Nessibou said PROCMURA, though formed as far back as 1959, began to look at women's concerns as a specific issue only in 1989. The organization has since conducted women's seminars and workshops throughout Africa to help women seek to strengthen their own sense of identity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Anne Kubai, a member of PROCMURA and a Kenyan Muslim, attributed the low literacy levels of Muslim women to the fact that secular education was associated with Christianity and there was fear that if Muslims joined these schools, they would be converted. Besides, education for Muslim girls was not a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kubai noted that in the many situations of conflict which have set Christians and Muslims against one another in the past and even today, each side has been guilty of maximizing the differences, usually to the detriment of similarities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the situation of Muslim women in Ghana, Ms. Fatimatu Sulemanu described Muslim women in her country as being &quot;on the periphery of the periphery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said schools for Muslim girls had since been built by the fairly new Federation of Muslim Women's Association of Ghana (FOMWAG) which seeks to liberate Muslim women in this West African country and also help women to understand Islam better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hajia Katumi Mahama, a Ghanaian Muslim participant at the conference noted that Christians worship and speak of God in ways which often differ radically from those of Muslims but she called for mutual respect and understanding between the two religions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA - The Methodist Church-Ghana (Wesleyan), has elected Rev. Dr. Samuel Asante Antwi, its new head and ninth President of Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Asante Antwi, 59, the out-going General Superintendent and Chairman of the Kumasi District of the church, replaces Prof. Emenritus Rt. Rev. Kwesi A.  Dickson who has served his term of office. Prof. Dickson was first elected to head the church in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Antwi, one time principal of Trinity Theological College, Legon near Accra was elected President at the 35th annual conference held at Winneba, in the Central Region from August 22 to 28, 1996. He is expected to assume office in 1997, and will serve for a five-year term, renewable through balloting for a second term of two years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My vision is to seek unity and reconciliation so that we all can translate dreams and visions for action towards the 21st Century,&quot; said Antwi in his acceptance speech. The out-going President Dr. Dickson urged churches to work together to achieve &quot;the goals of the great commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founded in 1835, the Methodist Church in Ghana is pastored by about 555 ministers, 28 of whom are women. This membership forms part of the over 62 per cent Christians out of Ghana's population of about 18 million people. In 1960, the last Chairman of the Synod became independent in 1961.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Methodist Church-Ghana is a member of the Christian Council of Ghana, the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), the Geneva-based World Council of Churches (WCC) and the World Methodist Council in the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Dickson, the out-going President is a member of the AACC General Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the Rt. Rev. Anthony Antwi Beeko, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana has appealed to individual members to enter politics to represent the voice of Christians in matters affecting the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the 67th Synod of the church at Kyebi on August 26, he declared: &quot;People who have the mind and spirit of Christ, people who are prepared to offer their lives for the sake of others, should be at the core and centre where decisions affecting the destiny of the country are taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Beeko said even though the church cannot do partisan politics, &quot;it should however be interested in how the country is governed because the church is part of the society and complements the efforts of the government.&quot; The six-day synod met under the theme, The Lord our God, Hope of the Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moderator asked Christians who accept to go into politics to impress on their colleagues that truth should not be sacrificed for expediency and that the welfare of the people is the supreme law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reminded the electorate about the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections, and urged that, &quot;in voting for people, let us ignore tribal and other affiliations and look for people who by their own lives have proved reliable, faithful and selfless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Beeko appealed to the government to reconsider the decision to deny religious bodies access to frequencies saying that, &quot;the reason given that such stations stand the danger of fanning religious differences to usher in instability is unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Take a taxi to Soweto if you want to get in touch with your black market base. This is the message from Taxinet, a leading media company responsible for advertisements flagged solely in the taxi industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As advertisers realise that the black market is no longer an emerging market, but one of the largest sectors waiting to snap up their products, so have they decided to learn as much as they can about the black consumer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxinet, established in 1987, caters for this need in the industry where white media planners, marketeers and retailers are grappling with the realities of the black consumer market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Realising the potential of Soweto tours, Taxinet recently joined up with Tribius Tshabalala, a taxi owner operating independently as a tour guide in Soweto, and for the last six years several clients such as tobacco company Rembrandt and supermarket chain Shoprite/ Checkers have sent representatives on tour in a bid to &quot;experience Soweto&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly white marketeers and retailers have found the tour &quot;informative&quot; as they have never before ventured into Soweto on their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshabalala admits he was initially &quot;surprised&quot; at the &quot;ignorance&quot; displayed by local advertisers and businessmen who are &quot;clueless&quot; on Soweto township life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's strange but true that they have as much to learn as the overseas tourists,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But is taking a four-hour day trip to Soweto enough to enable white marketeers and advertisers to target South Africa's main market black consumers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Rightford, Searle Tripp and Makin media director Yvonne Johnstone says &quot;it's a step in the right direction. It's certainly a good start as no one, other than Taxinet, has attempted to do so. It is a worthwhile experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnstone says the trips to Soweto &quot;provide a real texture and feel&quot; for the lifestyle of the black consumer, but whether this is enough to put media planners and advertisers fully in touch with their markets, she is not sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herdbouys advertising and marketing executive chairman Peter Vundla agrees.  Although Vundla says he is &quot;glad&quot; that white media planners are attempting to &quot;understand the main market&quot;, he adds that &quot;hopefully they will gain some insight&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vundla says the ignorance sometimes apparent among white advertisers is as a result of apartheid and personal racial prejudices some may harbour. &quot; Although endeavours are at least being made, I hope that advertising agencies will strive towards bringing in more black media planners. One trip to Soweto will certainly not make media planners experts and is a mere dipstick into the lifestyles of the main market consumer. It will also not redeem white media planners,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National media manager of Rembrandt Daantjie Esterhuysen says the Soweto tour is &quot;excellent&quot; and assists people to &quot;get in touch with the black market&quot; and &quot; get to know it better&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was informative to see how the Taxinet operations work and it is a treat,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esterhuysen went on a day and night trip with Taxinet's Soweto tours. The night trip involves a &quot;shebeen crawl&quot; where local residents can be met in a relaxing, after-work environment. The night tours have police protection so people can feel &quot;safe&quot;, according to Taxinet officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the atmosphere is very relaxed in Soweto, I do find that people feel safer knowing they have protection,&quot; Tshabalala says. Taxinet deputy managing director Ken Varejes says the tours are not limited to Soweto.  Managing directors and media-planners are also able to study Taxinet's other operations its 30 kiosks countrywide, its Star Music operation and its outdoor advertising conducted on the exterior of taxis. Focusing on the taxi industry, Taxinet serves about 14-million people representing more than 72% of black commuters &quot;a captive market&quot;, says Varejes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-legged operation may soon extend into a fourth division with plans for a free sheet of information. The publication, aimed at consumers, will host advertisements from companies and keep clients informed of Taxinet's activities and advertising options. The move into print will soon materialise, following the joint venture concluded last week with Primedia, owner of Radio 702.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Primedia chief executive William Kirsh refused to disclose the amount paid for the 60% stake in Taxinet, but says the deal &quot;will bolster&quot; the company's alternative media and specialist marketing and promotions activities. It will also, he says, &quot;add further balance to the group's income from media activities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Varejes says the Primedia/Taxinet venture has &quot;assisted the company with its capitalisation&quot;, adding that Taxinet will now be able to better service its clients and also develop and expand certain areas of the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Varejes says Taxinet hopes to secure future shares in the Primedia group, but refused to divulge details on what percentage of shares Taxinet was vying for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxinet's three operations include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Star Music, distributing audio cassettes to more than 22 000 of the 85 000 taxis nationally. The cassettes are tailored to each region and 15 minutes of advertising is sold on each 90-minute cassette. The bulk of material on the tape is popular local and international hits presented by selected disc jockeys and is compiled specifically for each area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every two months the tapes are renewed with advertisers plugging different products and are once again distributed to taxi-drivers free-of-charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Outdoor advertising Taxinet sells advertising space on the exterior of 3 500 taxis at a &quot;branding&quot; cost of R650 per month per taxi. This advertising is referred to as Trans Ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxi drivers are paid about R125 for playing the Star Music and having the taxi branded. The criteria for branding depends highly on the condition of the taxi. If the taxi is damaged, the taxi owner is given 10 days to repair the vehicle or have the advertisement stripped off the van, Varejes says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Taxinet's Commuter Reach operations initiative, regarded as a guaranteed method of distribution to commuters via kiosks situated in the most densely populated taxi ranks nationwide. The kiosks operate under the Taxinet banner.  The kiosk is decked out in whichever product is being advertised. Staffers wear promotional T-shirts, and leaflets are handed out free-of-charge. If a client uses all 30 kiosks, it will cost about R67 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey conducted by Integrated Marketing Research in all nine provinces found that 97% of all taxi commuters recalled the Coca-Cola branding, 87% the Zama Zama campaign and 76% the Aids campaign. These were branded on Taxinet minibuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With taxis carrying an average of 154 passengers daily a passenger travels about 12 times a week, about 67 minutes a day no wonder it is regarded by Varejes as an &quot;obvious market to target&quot;. According to the research, 74% of commuters are responsible for household purchases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The &quot;David and Goliath&quot; battle concerning overcharging by the banks, spearheaded by the Financial Research Foundation (FRF), rages on even though the principals do not seem to differ on whether people are in fact paying over the odds. This week the government entered the fray by calling on the public to suggest changes in the law at the centre of the storm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRF's Dave Thomas is adamant the banks are guilty of &quot;overcharging&quot; thousands of people with instalment credit deals ranging from bonds to cars and thereby breaking the Usury Act and other credit laws daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He estimates that in the minibus taxi industry alone an average of R20 000 per transaction is overcharged &quot;and the figures owed to taxi owners run into billions&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However Nico van Loggenberg, general manager of the Council of South African Association of Bankers (Cosab), was quick to repudiate the FRF's claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosab has found evidence of a few isolated cases where people were overcharged. &quot;These instances have and are being corrected as they are being discovered and they are nothing more than largely the result of genuine human error,&quot; Van Loggenberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have done our own investigations. We admit that mistakes do occur.&quot; He added that these mistakes are not as many as the FRF made them out to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A highly placed government source told the Mail &amp; Guardian that while key decision-makers in the government were sympathetic to the views raised by the FRF and agreed that a solution should be found, there was concern about the methods the FRF uses as well as the implications for the government if it were seen to be taking the FRF's side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the government's move to seek changes to the Usury Act, Van Loggenberg said he welcomed both the need to consolidate the different laws that arose from the homelands legacy, as well as the need to make the law more &quot;understandable, user-friendly and to enable it provide more protection to the consumer&quot;. Asked why the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has decided to run adverts calling on the public to submit ideas to change the Usury Act, DTI official Lizell Schultz said the department felt the law needed to be reviewed because &quot;to our knowledge there has been no prosecution under this law since 1968 probably because it allows for wide interpretations&quot; . She said the DTI was aware of the claims made, but declined to comment on them. The FRF has taken these cases to the ministries of Finance, Justice, Transport and the DTI, but has received scant response to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRF legal adviser Doug de Lange says the key aspect of the law which the banks break with impunity is their refusal to disclose details of the deals in dispute. This, he said, is compounded by the judicial system, which refuses to look at the Usury Act provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Lange said he did not see any reason why the laws should be changed, as in his view the Usury Act is simple and clear enough to give adequate protection to all. What really irks him is that the law is not applied at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The attorneys general are not prepared to prosecute since it is generally accepted that the banks do not have the intent to commit a crime,&quot; said De Lange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In keeping with what appears to be the operational style of the FRF, the M&amp;G was supplied with press cuttings and references to undetailed cases, such as one in June involving criminal charges laid against Wesbank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocate Billy Downer of the Western Cape attorney general's office said the case docket had just arrived at his desk &quot;two days ago&quot;. A decision to prosecute or not still had to be taken and this may be in another &quot;two weeks or so or even up to two months&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So while the FRF will pull out one or a handful of cases to support its claims, the authorities seem to be taking all the time in the world to address the issue. Meanwhile, discontent is believed to be brewing, at least among sections of the taxi industry in the Cape who are reported to be planning disruptive protest actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Thomas: &quot;The banks are hoping the problem will go away if they keep their heads in the sand. They are aware of the heavy workload on the courts which make them unable to cope ... The banks need to be forced to admit preferably in court that they have overcharged. They also need to commit to pay back every cent that they have overcharged.&quot; And so the saga continues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government is considering &quot;outsourcing&quot; all its departmental computer divisions, in a bid to get the public sector online and providing a better service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract, to be awarded to a single company, could be worth between R1, 5-billion and R1,8-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Expenditure Director General Hannes Smit has confirmed that discussions are under way, but said the decision to &quot;outsource&quot; would be taken on the basis of what was best for the taxpayer. Smit denied such a project would be &quot;privatisation&quot;, rather it is &quot;outsourcing&quot; as the government would be sole owner of the operation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Public Service Director General Dr Paseko Ncholo, Cabinet has already taken a decision to remove information technology (IT) divisions out of the government departments and lump them into a single operation called the Joint Service Organisation (JSO), which could then be outsourced. The JSO will act as an IT agency to serve all public sector needs and ensure more effective administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncholo is passionate about the need to upgrade the technology and skills in the public service and dreams of something called the one-stop service where most interactions between members of the public and the public sector would be conducted through a mega-computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There would be machines where you could go and pay your rates, electricity and water and get your pension money or a copy of your birth certificate, and you would be able to go to any machine you want in any part of town,&quot; he said.  Ncholo feels the frustration of people who suffer at the hands of sluggish and inept clerks. Unfortunately, employing a vast number of computer boffins to replace these clerks with machines is out of the question as the public service is to shed employees, not gain them. But Ncholo believes revamping the service's technology is the only way to pull South Africa's vast bureaucracy into the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that private sector investment or management would be essential if Ncholo and the Cabinet's dreams are to be realised, because the public sector does not have the right skills and resources to pioneer such a project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior manager of computer personnel firm CPL, Ivor Rimmer, said a programmer with 10 years' experience could ask for between R100 and a R150 an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a person from a project house went in and managed that person on site, then it would be even more expensive and the really top guys would cost about R300 an hour,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior manager of Communicate Personnel, Charlie Hayward, said the public service would have to look outside its ranks to find the people with the right skills for the JSO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In order to attract the skills they need for this sort of operation, they would have to attract the type of people whose profile has not fitted the public service traditionally and they will have to draw them out of the private sector where they are used to fast-moving top-level projects. This will take a lot of money,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Information is power and the Central Statistical Service is determined to put it to better use than the old government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a paper presented in August for the Institute for Advanced Social Research at the University of the Witwatersand in South Africa, Deborah Possel focused on the relationship between counting and controlling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She argued that in the apartheid state &quot;routines of statistical measurement of the population were certainly enmeshed with the exercise of power. From this perspective, governance consisted of solving big national problems, through large-scale interventions, co-ordinated from the centre. And the agent of social transformation was a bigger, more powerful, more knowledgeable state ... centralised statistical information played an important part.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the apartheid state, its relationship with the Central Statistical Service (CSS) was therefore of paramount importance. Now the CSS, under the direction of its new head Dr Mark Orkin, is faced with the challenge of transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The questions being asked in the research community are critical. Can the CSS, as a stalwart of the apartheid system, substantively change its focus and become the organ of a completely different state with a radically altered approach to governance? Can it address the needs of a democratic, decentralised and delivery-oriented government, facing the challenges of the new millennium?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most importantly, can it face the challenges of a developing economy in the global context? The failure of many developing states to provide relevant, precise and timely information is a costly and well-documented problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present CSS inherited a grossly inefficient system, characterised by consistently late reporting, irrelevant information, as well as the more strategic problem of bias towards information that supported a particular system. Is the approach to data collection changing, or is the CSS now simply going to feed a new set of priorities, using the same approach?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanlie van Dyk, an applied research and policy analysis expert at the Graduate School of Public Policy and Development Management, puts it succinctly: &quot;Clearly one has to look at whether your research priorities follow the national strategic framework. If that is the Reconstruction and Development Programme then that should influence your agenda. My fear is that we are not thinking about research in a pro-active way before it becomes a crisis. Somebody has to begin looking at the future identify trends and scenarios before we have to mobilise around issues because they have gotten out of hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orkin, coming from a non-governmental organisation background, the Community Agency for Social Inquiry which continues to propose alternative methodology frameworks and approaches to data collection, is fully aware of these questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We face a tightly interlinked matrix of demands characteristic of any statistical agency in the global economy.&quot; The internal constraints are the institutional inheritance, as well as the new budgetary and rationalisation decisions of central government and the Department of the Public Service and Administration. &quot;No more money and no more posts.&quot; The external environment is of an international regulatory framework imposed by agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations. Both require that countries report faster, post their findings on the Internet, and account for everything. &quot;If you do not meet their requirements you can kiss your loan access goodbye.&quot; Finally, there is the challenge of developing new and appropriate demographic products. This entails both a backward-looking component that dismantles the apartheid approach to statistics, and a forward- looking one such as servicing the needs of provincial governments, and developing aggregable national standards of delivery, which can be monitored, evaluated and acted on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment the tools at the disposal of the CSS to meet these challenges are Census 96, the October Household Surveys, and over 100 economic surveys a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are serious about the growth and development strategy, we have to understand the lessons of international experience. I call it the 20/40/60/80 model. Sweden has 160 statisticians per million, Malaysia has 80, Botswana and the Philippines 40, and South Africa 20. Countries moving up the scale of economic development are recognising the need for critical economic and budgeting intelligence and, therefore, for a central statistical service size does count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orkin is categorical: the real challenge is to rightsize the public service so that it can best deliver on strategic priorities, which should be linked to the government's rationalisation programme. But Van Dyk wonders whether the CSS will ever be able to face the challenge of the country's strategic priorities since the products it is locked into delivering, and the heavily quantitative orientation of the staff, may prevent the kind of analysis that both she and Orkin stress is necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Orkin: &quot;The way forward is radical institutional transformation.&quot; The CSS appears to be well on its way to becoming a model for public sector reform. &quot;In one year we have leaped 15, we are able to learn from international best practice and jump to the forefront.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process has, however, been complicated: &quot;Half of the improvement we needed in timeousness was simply a question of better management.&quot; The first challenge was to create a new organisation with new strategic focus areas, and employ new people for the job. The Demographic Unit is an example of this the Chief Director &quot;Mr Census&quot;, Pali Lehola, is the first black appointment to senior management in the history of the CSS. The approach to the census has been radical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are methodologically taking democracy seriously,&quot; explains Orkin, through close interaction with government departments and in the approach to each citizen making the census available in all languages, as well as attempting to address each citizen as an individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, the CSS is now divided into 29 integrated work teams of professionals and experts, linked to a performance-evaluation system, which creates a sense of individual accountability in each public servant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of information technology, Orkin compares the improvements for end users to moving straight from DOS into Windows 95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More crucially, the innovations at provincial level will become a key leverage point for integrated national and economic planning. Each provincial office will become a source of relevant statistical information as well as a professional monitoring and evaluation tool for provincial governments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The rise in international oil prices triggered by the United States missile attacks on Iraq could have important ripple effects on the South African economy, analysts warned this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increases in key international oil prices are expected to boot up the petrol and diesel pump prices next month, which will hit inflation and the already shaky balance of payments by adding to South Africa's import bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, South Africa could at least rely on a higher gold price as compensation, but bullion's traditional role as a safe haven has been usurped by the dollar, which strengthened against all the major currencies this week, driving down the rand, and in turn adding to inflationary pressures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gold was trading in London at $385,90 to $386,20 per ounce, while the dollar hovered around DM1,48 and $1,5690 against the pound.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International oil prices have risen in the wake of the strikes because traders have pushed back the date at which they expect the United Nations to lift its embargo on Iraqi oil sales imposed after the 1991 Gulf war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the crisis, October Brent crude was trading just below $21 and hit a post-Gulf war high of $23,60 in Asian trade shortly after the US's first strike. At the time of going to press, oil was priced at $21,85.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London oil analysts said the uncertainty in the Middle East which is expected to rule out the return of Iraqi oil to the market this year and the onset of the northern hemisphere winter, which would boost demand for heating fuels, had injected bullish sentiment into the market. One analyst said he had revised upwards by $1 his forecast for the average Brent crude price in the fourth quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet economist Mike Schussler said if the oil price lingered around the $22 a barrel level, the country's annual import bill for the year would rise by about R1-billion. Schussler said these factors would encourage Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals to leave interest rates at their current high levels, to attract capital to pay for the increased imports. &quot;All possible downward momentum on the prime-rate has been shot out of the water.&quot; He calculated the petrol price would rise to between R2,25 and R2,30 a litre next month, from its current R2,08 if the oil price remained around $22. This week's 3 cents a litre price drop thus looks rather shortlived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Econometrix economist Tony Twine said the peculiar pricing of South Africa's petrol central to the regulated market could shield motorists from the effects of temporarily high crude oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's petrol is costed according to product prices in Singapore and Bahrain, despite the fact that local refiners import crude oil from the Middle East. He said Far East product prices would take some time to react and even then the Iraq-inspired increases would have to be sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, other analysts hope the jump in international oil prices will remind the government of the importance of a systematic energy efficiency policy, as highlighted in a recent report by the International Energy Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no incentives for new houses to be built with insulation or constructed facing north. The police do not impose fines for faulty tyre pressures, which add millions to the country's annual petrol bill. The government does not force motor manufacturers to improve the fuel efficiency of their cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategic Fuel Fund General Manager Kobus van Zyl, who is in charge of the state's oil procurement, said this week's events would probably postpone the sealing of any arrangement to buy Iraqi oil, which had been on the cards. The fund buys most of its oil from Iran and Egypt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - &quot;Now that we can afford to fly here,&quot; quipped Richard Branson, head of Virgin Atlantic, in an apparent side-swipe at the prevailing duopoly, &quot;many more investments will follow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First off is a Virgin Megastore; a site has been earmarked and discussions with potential partners &quot;one or two retail chains&quot; are ongoing, but details will have to wait until Virgin makes its inaugural flight on October 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more definite is a link-up with a local airline: Sun Air is the frontrunner. But hopes that such a move will spearhead the government's privatisation campaign are premature -- a marketing agreement, possibly on the lines of the British Airways-Comair deal, is more feasible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sun Air is the obvious choice, says an industry analyst, because it most closely matches Virgin's service ethos, and has an impressive growth record.  And from Sun Air's point of view, survival in the cut-throat airline world increasingly means hitching up to a global carrier. Virgin is keen to foster other partnerships in South Africa, reflecting its breadth of interests from Virgin Cola to Virgin Direct, a financial services division. &quot;The Virgin name is strong internationally, which is an immediate attraction,&quot; said Branson, &quot; plus, we bring in the expertise and share it with local companies. In this way we hope to contribute towards helping South Africa achieve its growth objectives, as well as encouraging other investors to come into this market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime, he added, should not be a deterrent to potential investors: &quot;We fly to plenty of high-crime cities. It's never stopped us in the past and it won't stop us now. But it is welcome news that the government is taking the crime issue seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branson was also confident of winning the battle in the air: &quot;We've never failed yet on a new route and this is a perfect scenario a comfortable duopoly that needs shaking up on price competitiveness and service. We intend to do just that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry analysts expressed some reservations, however, about tempting the lucrative business travel market away from established frequent flyer bonuses, but Branson was not deterred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bookings for October are going very well, and uncharacteristically, business travellers have signed up well in advance. We're looking forward to being a major force in this market.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another rugby cathedral, Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria, stages the final act in which Australia confront Kenya and South Africa seek a hat-trick of victories over Ghana in what could prove the title decider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pirates, struggling to maintain high standards with a squad tired from too much football, have received a welcome boost with the return of centrehalf Gavin Lane. Known as Stability Unit, the burly defender was one of the heroes of the shock Champions' Cup final triumph over ASEC in the Ivory Coast last year and has been sorely missed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from Lane, Pirates are blessed with an outstanding goalkeeper in Nigerian Williams Okpara and a highly under-rated defender in Hendrick &quot;Phiri&quot; Tsotetsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No less an expert than senior coach and TV analyst Eddie Lewis rates Tsotetsi as national squad material because he is an outstanding man-to-man marker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buccaneers have not been exceptionally sharp in midfield lately, partly due to the fact that Dumisani Ngobe has often had to drop back to solve a defensive manpower crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Moeti and Helman Mkhalele have been playing virtually non-stop since the beginning of last year and it is a constant source of amazement that they are still ticking over, albeit at low revs. Jerry Sikosana returned to action last week following a three-match suspension and deservedly earned a call-up to the national squad for the Four Nations' Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pirates' biggest problem has been scoring goals and much will hinge on Sikosana, whose superb run and goal took his club past Mufulira Wanderers of Zambia in the previous round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While South Africa lifted the Champions' Cup at only the third attempt, Nigeria have been trying in vain for three decades to get their hands on the prestigious club trophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stars reached the last eight with impressive aggregate victories over Mangasport of Gabon 5-2 (4-0 home and 1-2 away) and Dynamos of Zimbabwe 6-4 (5-1 home and 1-3 away).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these results suggest Stars are poor travellers, it should be remembered that the Nigerians took four-goal leads to Libreville and Harare, which almost inevitably led to a slight weakening of resolve. The Nigerian club have no stars as the best players from the West African nation like Finidi George, Jay Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Daniel Amokachi and Emmanuel Amunike perform in various European leagues. Kalu Umar is worthy of special attention from Pirates, though, having scored five goals in four Champions' Cup matches, including a hat-trick against Mangasport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goalkeeper Abiodun Baruwa made international headlines last year when Zimbabwe accused him of being more than 23 years old and, therefore, ineligible for the Olympics qualifying tournament. Fortunately for Nigeria, who faced disqualification from the Games, the Zimbabwe allegation could not be substantiated and the West Africans went on to claim gold at Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pirates narrowly defeated another Nigerian club, BCC Lions, on their way to glory last year and Stars are likely to prove even tougher opposition, especially on their own ground in the university city of Ibadan. The Simba Four Nations' Cup grows in stature each year and the 1996 line-up is the strongest invited to an annual event which offers more than $100 000 in prize money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa shared the title with the Ivory Coast in 1994 and last year were outright winners, topping Egypt, Zambia and Zimbabwe in a tournament plagued by bad weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National coach Clive Barker has been forced to name a 29-strong squad, such is the uncertainty surrounding many members of the &quot;Foreign Legion&quot; based in Europe, notably Lucas Radebe and John &quot;Shoes&quot; Moshoeu. But as Pirates senior citizen Marks Maponyane noted recently, the man from Durban has a habit of turning adversity to his benefit and it could well be the case again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia boast a 100% record against South Africa, having beaten them in Adelaide and Sydney two years ago while Bafana Bafana have had the Indian sign over Ghana, conquering them twice. Last, but certainly not least, come Kenya, the country which caused the biggest shock of the 1998 World Cup qualifying competition by eliminating Algeria 3-2 on aggregate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan under-23 team were unlucky losers to their South African counterparts at Milpark Stadium this year and the same coach, Yugoslav Vojo Gardesevic, is in charge of the seniors. With Nations' Cup qualifiers beginning in October and the first World Cup matches due one month later, the Simba Four Nations' Cup represents a golden opportunity to prepare troops for battle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Someone had to say it, and All Black coach John Hart did not disappoint. One foot on the plane? A New Zealand Test team? Pull the other one. There has never been a wearer of the silver fern who has not concentrated his all on the job at hand. The Springboks earned their victory the hard, blood-and-guts way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it truly was a magnificent victory in the face of a barrage of adversity, injury and an All Black side pumped up to take a 3-0 whitewash home with them. It was, even for as committed a side as Sean Fitzpatrick's New Zealanders, a bridge too far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 32-22 win for Gary Teichmann's side has engendered a number of important things for Springbok rugby. Not least of them will be a revival of confidence in a side that has been under fire from virtually every quarter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the win produced the result that has so often threatened sans delivery, it cannot, in all fairness, be equated with the decisive significance of a Waterloo. But it did- swopping campaigns and generals -- have some of the elements of bravery of the charge at Balaclava about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow, if they could find a horse standing tall enough or stirrups of the length required, you can just picture Teichmann leading from the front, wielding a sabre and rallying the flagging enthusiasm as the roar of the guns grows in intensity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rangy Natalian has been an inspiration this season both in the way he has lifted his game to peaks that only a year or so back would have seemed beyond him, and how he has grafted this industry to the business of accepting the onerous task of captaining a losing side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, it is of note that Francois Pienaar, one of the most inspirational of on-field leaders, and Morne du Plessis, a man who has matched this priceless ability both on and off the demarcated playing area, have not truly been a part of the mini-revival. Pienaar through injury; Du Plessis through an almost tragic indifference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One questions whether Du Plessis will ever be persuaded to again put his personal interests on the back-burner and lend his not inconsiderable knowledge to the cause of South African rugby. More to the point, put in his position, would you? The way he has been treated is a tragedy beyond belief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pienaar's position has far more thorns. It is open knowledge that he and the top brass of the South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) have mutually decided that swopping Christmas cards this year would be an unaccustomed politeness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, too, is a tragedy. But then perhaps the writing was on the wall when coach Andre Markgraaff, a man who had nothing to do with the World Cup victory, made Pienaar, a man who was central to it, prove himself by playing through an injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was one of those incomprehensible decisions which must have left Pienaar -- if you pardon the continuation of the military analogy -- wondering why he was being so badly strafed by what is ineptly called friendly fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a time for the consideration of the fact that players are the assets and should be treated as such. Selectorial policy should be about the safeguarding and honing of these assets, merely a means of gathering the riches and distributing them wisely and evenly. In Pienaar's case, the thinking was surely a trifle profligate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pienaar, one suspects, will have to do what he has done so many times in the past and come storming back. One also suspects that right now the odds are stacked against him. From a personal point of view, all power to his arm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The players knew the value of both Pienaar and Du Plessis in the very ethos of that face-saving victory at Ellis Park last Saturday though. It was a win which took the edge off the disappointments of a series -- one Hart quite rightly points out now stands 4-1 on a home-and-away basis this season -- and Teichmann surely had the backing of his side when he dedicated it to Du Plessis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a gesture that engendered a petty piece of churlishness from Louis Luyt, who emerged from his self-imposed isolation to immediately snatch away the offering of the players, maintaining that it was &quot;for the 43 million South Africans, not for an individual&quot; that the Springboks had finally come good and posted the biggest-ever Test score against an All Black side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luyt, a sports administrator with the perspicacity to become the first official to initiate talks with the ANC in the days when they still wore communist horns, must surely have missed the point that, in picking a man convicted of a killing with racial overtones, there is a large proportion of those millions that have lost all recently-acquired faith in Springbok rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then Luyt, for all the many attributes he has proved to have, has ever cast some bewildering shadows. The victory also gained some much-needed breathing space for the coach whose record currently stands at three successes in the last eight outings. Few would doubt that he needs it.  Injuries have played a major part in the havoc which has surged around him.  No one of sound mind would gainsay that fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is also cause to examine the inconsistencies in what Markgraaff has done. John Allan has disappeared without trace. Steve Atherton has flitted through the side, into obscurity and then back to the bench, and James Small has been consigned to an uncertain limbo after a superb performance at fullback against the Wallabies in Bloemfontein. Add this up if you have the arithmetical ability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other anomalies. Yes, losing Johan Ackermann from the second row could not have helped. But Markgraaff, a better-than-average lock in his own playing days, has taken fully eight Tests to get the lineout working to anything like international standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, last Saturday's pairing of Mark Andrews and Kobus Wiese are to be congratulated. Before he went off to be replaced by Fritz van Heerden, Andrews showed one of the biggest pluses of lock forward play in this country of late. Jumping at No 4, Andrews took the loop ball with ease, nullifying to all intents and purposes the lunging tactics of Ian Jones and Robin Brooke on the flat, snap throw-in which has been the Springbok norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Wiese. Truly magnificent. This, for me at least, was the performance of the match. His sheer physical presence and cerebral approach to the tough business of stoking the fires in the very innards of the scrum might have cost him a vicious eye-gouging, but it earned him a huge amount of New Zealand respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiese, to quote the vernacular, vat geen kak van helicopter pilots. And on top of that, took every one of his own put-ins. In this, he was surely helped by the return of his Transvaal teammate James Dalton at hooker. And here was another player who made a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dalton is not without his detractors. But he remains a fine player whose mobility adds significantly more to broken play than does the cumbersome Henry Tromp. The Bullet also has the ability to burrow in from a stance built disconcertingly close to the playing surface and rip out the ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all added some much needed extra fire-power to the South African eight ..  . and in consequence laid the platform of the extra half metre for Joost van der Westhuizen's brilliance to truly shine. Two glitteringly individualistic and opportunistic tries signalled this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also some almost kamikaze tackling for the All Blacks to think about and this, too, made a difference of some substance in the overall dynamics of the game. Japie Mulder's references were clearly spelt out by Frank Bunce, who rates him highly. One can only hope that Mulder -- remember that devastating tackle on Jonah Lomu in the World Cup final? -- can shake off his back problems for good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Henry Honiball, one tackle on Bunce's centre partner Walter Little clearly spelt out the intentions of the lanky Underberg farmer. Little was both driven back a full two metres and unceremoniously dumped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite apart from the fact that he must subconsciously have been looking for the next Honiball defensive blitzkrieg, that tackle had the effect of reversing the momentum and holding the gainline for the rest of the South African backs to arrange themselves behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are still some problem areas. The front row remains a coaching nightmare, but this, one feels, can be remedied. So too can the indecision about flyhalf and the role that this pivotal position occupies in present and future tense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what it all adds up to was a growing understanding that here was a side both able and willing to impose its joint and several authority on a game against an extraordinary team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African rugby, its players and supporters alike, can take heart from this stirring outing and, while it might not fully be the plinth from which to launch the euphoria that followed a victory few in the packed Ellis Park stands would have bet on before the first whistle, is a sound basis for future embellishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A word of caution though. It is certainly not cause for the coach and selectors to follow the example of the cavalry at Balaclava and charge headlong at the guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way Morne du Plessis has been treated is a tragedy beyond belief</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Jan Bergman believes he is the best boxer in South Africa.  This weekend he has a chance to prove his boast correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a kind of prickly arrogance about Jan Bergman which comes across as alternatively endearing or plain irritating, depending on your vantage point.  He's a man who &quot;knows&quot; he's the best boxer in South Africa, and even though he doesn't yet have much to show for it in terms of the baubles this game dishes out, he demands to be treated accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others among the country's fighting elite, like Vuyani Bungu, Mbulelo Butile and Philip Holiday, who could make similar claims and have the titles to illustrate the point, are the picture of understated modesty, but Bergman comes from a different tradition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he upsets the 7:1 odds and lifts the IBF junior welter crown from the brush-cut head of the brilliant, unbeaten, Aussie-based Russian, Kostya Tszyu, in Newcastle, Australia, on Saturday, there will be no end to expressions of his renowned pride and recalcitrance, so it's worth knowing the roots of the condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing up in the toughest corner of the coloured township of Toekomsrus, Bergman was raised to show absolute loyalty to his &quot;own&quot;, to protect fiercely everything he'd achieved, and to be wary of those who might want to take it away. He grew up in a family which was an island of stability in a little world ruled by gangsters, corrupt cops, drugs, alcoholism and deprivation and it was in this environment that he learnt to survive, thrive and protect. He was pretty, bright, did well at school and sport, and most of all he could fight like a cornered alley cat when the occasion demanded, as it so often did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mummy was a factory worker and my father worked on the mines, so they were away the whole day. I was the oldest of six children, and I had to look out for the others. The section we grew up in was very, very rough in those days -- there were lots of gangs -- so when I was nine I joined Bokkie Martin's Eagle Boxing Club to keep out of trouble, but there were fights all the time in the streets and I couldn't avoid them. You fight different in the street -- no rules -- you use your head, your feet, your knees, but the boxing training helps 'cause you learn to avoid punches, to get in quickly, get out quickly and finish them off. I had plenty of street fights and I never lost one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, winning a street fight doesn't come with a referee raising your hand; it tends to involve beating the other fellow senseless before giving him a few turns with the boot, just to make sure. Most boxers come from comparable backgrounds, but with Bergman you sense an element of this adversarial approach and desire for closure have been taken into life more generally. To his credit though, throughout his career he has shown a stolid refusal to pucker up for anyone, and from the start made it clear that whatever his apartheid classification, he was black and proud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, when officials from the old government Boxing Board robbed his Toekomsrus homeboy, Aladin Stevens, of his national lightweight crown, and then diddled him out of a return with the favoured Danny Myburgh, Bergman had no compunction about giving an emphatic verbal finger to them, before putting in his own challenge. The all-powerful board ignored him, so he stepped up in weight and whipped Myburgh's stablemate, Aaron Kabi, for the national light welterweight crown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, when his first promoters, Gerrie Coetzee and Rhoan Gardiner, failed to deliver on their promises, he haughtily walked out, and moved over to their sworn rival Rodney Berman. Soon after, one of Bergman's &quot;international&quot; opponents dropped out of a Berman bill, and he refused to fight a last-minute local substitute. He said he'd rather not be paid than face the indignity of squaring up to an unknown South African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By that stage Bergman was already a brilliant fighter, but he had never received anything approaching professional-level training. Bokkie Martin was not up to the job but, contrary to everyone's advice, the fiercely loyal boxer insisted he was part of the package. So both the fighter and his long- time trainer, as well as Bergman's wife and former high school sweetheart, Prudence, and their young son Evander (named after former world heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield), were relocated to Las Vegas. A second son, Jameel, was born there soon after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An elite United States trainer, Kenny Adams, was retained and Bergman began to make the necessary adjustments. The arc of his devastating left hook was tightened, his stance was shifted to make him less open, his workrate was increased and he was taught to make openings, rather than wait for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My style has changed since I arrived here,&quot; he acknowledges. &quot;I've become more aggressive. I stay very busy, I don't counter-punch as much, and I don't expect a knockout with every punch. I set up my punches, so I'm more dangerous. I'm also much smarter now, my jab has improved no end, and I'm fitter and stronger than I've ever been before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been several years since his promoters first talked about imminent world title shots. Last year he became the mandatory contender for Julio Cesar Chavez's WBC title, but when Bergman's people challenged the fading Mexican, the WBC dropped Bergman for a less threatening contender and then removed him from their rating altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, the IBF stripped Tszyu of his IBF title when he refused to fight Hugo Pineda in Columbia, and Bergman and Pineda were set to contest the vacant crown. But Tszyu took legal action and won and Bergman had to wait yet another year to get his chance. On Saturday afternoon he finally gets his chance to show his stuff, but most international &quot;experts&quot; believe the result is inevitable: Tszyu on a knockout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They reason the Sydney-based Siberian was one of the finest amateurs in history, winning a world title and losing only three of 272 fights, and that his performances in the professional arena have been even more impressive.  After only four months he started whipping a series of former world professional champions and it was not long before he was pounding the daylights out of Jake Rodriguez to lift the world title himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's an immensely powerful, extremely accurate puncher who never lets an opponent off the hook when he has him going. Add to that his quick reflexes, conditioning and his solid chin, and the picture does not seem too encouraging for the South African. But as Bergman points out, the man is not without his flaws. Like most European-trained amateurs, he stands too erect.  He does not move quickly around the ring and takes too many punches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know everybody overseas thinks I've only got a tiny chance against Tszyu, but I know that fate will carry me through,&quot; says Bergman. &quot;I'll work him with my jab. He'll be looking out for the left and left hook, but I will counter him with the right. He likes to go all out in the early rounds, but that's exactly what I want. I will pick him off and prove to him that a good boxer can beat a good brawler. You can tell my people at home that they don't need to worry because I'm going to be smart in there, and at the end of the fight I will be crowned world champion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tszyu is stronger, more durable and probably has the better chin. Bergman is taller, faster, more fluid and may have the bigger concussive punch. I share Bergman's view that he's the best boxer in South Africa today, and I like to think that's good enough to beat one of the 10 best fighters in the world. Bergman on points. (But maybe that's just wishful thinking.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - CITIZEN AND SUBJECT: CONTEMPORARY AFRICA AND THE LEGACY OF LATE COLONIALISM by Mahmood Mamdani (James Currey/Fountain/David Philip, R79, 95) -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan academic Mahmood Mamdani, who worked in South Africa for a time, has written a wide-ranging and highly theoretical book which attempts to discern a pattern in the process of colonialism in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He begins by giving an outline of Africa's impasse, the legacy of late colonialism: tribalism, the failure of democratisation, despotisms of various sorts, and policies which oscillate between modernism (civil society) and traditionalism (communitarianism). The central problems of the post- independence states are succinctly stated: &quot;The failure to democratise explains why deracialisation was not sustainable and why development ultimately failed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamdani expounds a theory which lays bare the roots of this situation.  Citizen and Subject is divided into two parts, the first analysing the structure of power in post-colonial Africa. He defines the central difficulty for colonisers as the &quot;native question&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the problems of political economy and labour emerged, it was the need to control the native population which most exercised the colonialist policy-makers. This concern marked a shift in colonialism: from a &quot;civilizing mission&quot; to the more Machiavellian task of wielding power economically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan Smuts formulated this problem in other terms. Either the African becomes a citizen of a state (direct rule), in which case he becomes a caricature of European man, or he must be ruled in a way which allows him to preserve his tradition and culture. The latter route, which Smuts prescribed, was the policy of institutional segregation -- allowing tribal structures to flourish beneath the rule of the modern state (indirect rule). This virtually Africanist philosophy paradoxically became a central pillar of colonial rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually colonial Africa was governed through both forms of rule, a complementary mode which emerged through trial and error: direct rule for citizens, indirect rule for subjects. Or civil society for the elites (citizens), and state controlled tribalism for the indigenous majority (subjects).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This arrangement Mamdani refers to as the bifurcated state, a modern state set over and above an absolutist, patriarchal state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy of indirect rule served as a precondition for the development of what Mamdani calls decentralised despotism, the form of state which he argues emerged as the norm in colonial Africa, and indeed in independent Africa, either intact or as a variation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decentralised despotism is characterised by a central authority which rules the periphery through the virtual creation of tribes and tribal authorities.  The imperial power mobilises tribal authority, makes members of the tribe subject to a customary law which is a caricature of the customary law of indigenous communities. Tradition becomes deformed into a form of tribalism that is functional for colonial rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the modern period this arrangement leads to a reversal of one or other aspect of the form of state: either the despotism becomes overly centralised, as in radical one-party states and military rule, or the central authority ceases to have any relation to its periphery, to the rural countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In every case, there is a failure of democratisation and in the development of an authentic civil society, a failure of the state to reach out into the rural areas to traditional communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second part of the book analyses the structure of resistance. In Mamdani's view, the form of resistance is always determined by the form of power, just as the state is always the outcome of the dialectic between power and resistance. He analyses the South African scenario as an example of successful resistance in the civil sphere - though he also sees a failure to mobilise (Zulu) rural resistance to apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the other pole, Uganda is shown to have an effective rural resistance to colonialism. Mamdani stresses that tribalism is not inherently retrogressive, while anti-tribal movements are not necessarily progressive. Rather, in Africa power mobilises tribalism, but so too does resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An interesting principle of Citizen and Subject is the contention that apartheid, rather than being an exceptional form of colonial state, is instead paradigmatic of colonialism in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africans will be impressed by Mamdani's interpretation of apartheid and its prehistory, but also by his analysis of the dangers of our current situation. He warns of a preoccupation with civil society at the expense of rural society -- a failure to extend democracy to the periphery and to incorporate the rural into the mainstream being the greatest danger of our transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamdani must be commended for attempting an analysis which does not shirk a realistic perception of the state of Africa. He manages not to be ideologically blinkered and yet does not slip into bland pragmatism. His analysis is rigorous, and breaks new ground. He challenges established positions, and in some cases resolves previously intractable debates. He passionately desires Africa to free itself from its impasse, and essential to this is the creation of a true state-form -- a relation which works.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When Elias and Aaron Lerole were small boys, they were already to be found on the streets and at Johannesburg's Zoo Lake every Sunday earning a living as pennywhistlers. Now, Elias's children are carrying on with the tradition. His son Tebogo, 19, has just released a CD called Kwela Tebza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lerole family are a veritable Jackson clan -- they're all crazy about music and they all play or sing. Elias still plays and teaches, his wife Thembi plays piano, organ, sings, reads music and teaches. Tebogo's sister Carol, 23, sings on the album and his brothers Mpho, 18, and Tsepho, 15, also play pennywhistle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tebogo got to record Kwela Tebza (&quot;Tebza&quot; as in an affectionate shortening of &quot;Tebogo&quot;) through winning the category of Best Solo Performance in the Shell Road To Fame, a category into which his mother entered him by mistake.  He was there to enter the dance category with a group of enthusiasts who didn't get beyond the first rounds. Fortunately though, when his name was called for a solo performance, mum just happened to have a pennywhistle in her bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the songs on the CD were written by Tebogo, with a few co-composed by Kelly Petlane, who also plays pennywhistle on the album. The musicians include three of South Africa's best -- Bakhithi Khumalo and Victor Masondo on bass and Isaac Mtshali on drums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tebogo, a quiet, shy boy, is still doing Standard 8 at Cedarwood College in Wynberg. He wants to study music at university, aiming at a doctorate in music, although exactly what aspect of music is not yet clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't his young friends think he's crazy to play this old stuff? &quot;It's our real music. It's African music, it's our roots,&quot; he says. &quot;Some of them think it's old-fashioned, not all of them. I also like modern music, though. Some call me madala (old man) or Kenny G, all those names. It doesn't worry me.&quot; He adds later: &quot;My friends don't mock me. They can see where the gold is hidden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elias, now 58, played with the Alexandra Shamba Boys, Zig Zag Jive Flute and Black Mambazo. Aaron Lerole's composition, Tom Hark, was a huge hit in the 1950s. In fact, it was even big in the United Kingdom and clarinettist Ted Heath recorded a jazz orchestration of the song. Aaron, who switched to saxophone, may also be remembered for Lion Killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was something joyful and entertaining about those pennywhistle songs, or kwela songs, as they were called. Kwela apparently means &quot;pick-up&quot; and the name comes from a line in the song Tom Hark which goes &quot;Here come the khwela khwela vans&quot;, a reference to police vans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The song, according to writer Muff Andersson's Music in the Mix, netted Columbia a quarter of a million rand, of which Elias Lerole saw next to nothing. &quot;We used to get paid five pounds for a session. There were no royalties, we knew nothing about royalties. We had a big fight with the record company when we first found out about royalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a lot of hits. Tom Hark was the biggest, another one was We Thula We Mama. I made more than 40 records, 78s and singles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stopped playing as the fad for kwela died out, the musicians got older and some moved on to saxophone and township jazz. &quot;But last year the original Black Mambazo members got together and recorded an album's worth of material.  It's me, my brother Aaron, Zeph Nkabinde (older brother to Mahlathini), David Ramosa and Piet Khumalo.&quot; Naturally, they recorded kwela. &quot;And it rocks the nation!&quot; pronounces a loyal Tebogo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since leaving the groups of his youth, Elias has made a living as a taxi driver, not exactly the country's safest profession. &quot;Now I'm doing nothing.  I was in the taxi business, but they burnt six of my vans at a taxi rank in Meadowlands. Others were stolen. Ai! They stripped me, really, really. I'm trying to start again. I wasn't insured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Tebogo of his CD, which has been getting a lot of airplay according to Polygram: &quot;I'm very happy, really, very, very happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adds his beaming father: &quot;When he started learning, he used to fight, he used to cry.&quot; Didn't he want to learn? &quot;Oh yes, I wanted to learn,&quot; says Tebogo, &quot;but it was very hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does Tebogo's career mean Elias is having a chance to relive his youth?  Elias laughs: &quot;I feel very nice when I look at them. It really does something for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopefully, Tebogo will find the pot of gold hidden somewhere in the music industry. It would certainly help redress the injustices suffered by his father and uncle in the 1950s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tebogo Lerole will be performing live with a 12-person band at an SABC function on September 20 and at a trade exhibition at Nasrec in October</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The invitation to Canned Africa at Cape Town's Association for Visual Arts describes it as a photographic exhibition. This, however, is a trifle misleading. In these 11 giant works, Geoffrey Grundlingh has pushed the frontiers of photography into another dimension.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been the head of the photographic department at the Michaelis School of Fine Art at UCT since 1980 and during this time 17 of his photographs have been purchased or commissioned by the SA National Gallery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Works from this exhibition will be travelling to Oslo, Norway in 1997, where Grundlingh has been invited to exhibit with 14 other South African artists (these include William Kentridge, Penny Siopis, Lukas van Vuuren and Willie Bester) at the Nation Museum for Contemporary Art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unusual for a &quot;photographer&quot; to be invited to exhibit with artists, but Grundlingh will be at ease since his work represents a vital departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grundlingh uses his camera like a brush and his tripod as an easel: it is not photography that you see on the wall. Rather, the works take the viewer on a strange ride through the realms of echoes, connections, odd coincidences and unexplained resonances. Using the reflective technique of triptych, he harnesses disparate images that assume a life of their own -- they actually converse with each other -- leaving the viewer to guess, for a very long time, exactly what those relationships are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a mischievous artist who shatters assumed perceptions and invokes an emotional reaction of lunatic ambiguity. A diamond-mesh fence becomes the outline of Table Mountain; the bronze bust of P W Botha in a museum is a cadaverous shadow. &quot;Happy Valley&quot; in Port Elizabeth is toned and crafted into a landscape of bleak desertion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grundlingh's work is never overtly political (or social or historical) -- it is the voluntary associations the viewer is enticed to make between photographs in the diptych of triptych that gives the work its content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the saddest part about this exhibition (which closes on September 7) , is that only one of the 11 works has been reserved. Apparently large corporations do not buy &quot;photographs&quot; -- particularly those that pose some challenging questions above the boardroom table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Grundlingh: &quot;The idea of buying photography for the corporate lobby is a concept that is beginning to happen in Europe, but not here. Buyers from the large companies want innocuous still-life and flowers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a pity -- these are broad canvases which play merry havoc with our common understanding of &quot;reality&quot; and lead the imagination into some intriguing by-ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grundlingh's photographs are on show until September 7 at The Association for Visual Arts in Cape Town</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the beginning there was the word. Then the word became print, opening up a seemingly magical world in which information could be reproduced and circulated for mass consumption. Then came the book, containing the continuum of experience and the moving pictures of the imagination within its covers, reassuring readers they were not really alone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps that was the impetus behind art collector and self-confessed bibliomaniac Jack Ginsberg's obsession with books. Not your common or garden text and illustration books, mind, nor those coffee-table door-stoppers designed for rookie intellectuals. Ginsberg's books are not for conventional reading. They nestle in walnut shells, are made from mirror, shaped like accordions or teddy bears, and printed on wood, sackcloth or found objects by fine artists, film-makers, calligraphers, conceptualists and other creative spirits. And his unique collection of artists' books forms the spine of an exhibition which speaks in volumes, not only about the book as subject and object but also the bonding of private, meditative labour with public culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-curated by Ginsberg and David Paton, who is completing his masters thesis on book collection, this mammoth endeavour is second in scale only to one held recently at the Pompidou Centre in Paris. It is also extremely timeous, given the controversy raging over the release of the Film and Publications Bill on Censorship and particularly for a country which -- in previous years -- took such pride in violating all forms of creative expression. This is also an exhibition which beckons to communities who normally dread crossing the rarefied gallery threshhold. After all, as the poster points out, the show is by authors who do not write. Comprehension, therefore is not dependant on literacy levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consisting of books by artists worldwide, including Willem Boshoff, Belinda Blignaut and Pippa Skotnes of South Africa, Artists' Books presents curatorial challenges which are hardly ever confronted within the context of a conventional art exhibition. For, while it is acceptable to contain or suspend an art object for purposes of contemplation, the serial nature of a book militates against this strategy. Books demand direct access. And artists' books in particular function primarily as installations to be viewed from multiple perspectives. The curators were faced, therefore, with the task of choosing which aspects of the books to display at the expense of others.  But they have risen to the challenge by using photographs showing the different states of the books, treating the gallery as an exo-skeleton of sorts and the exhibition space as a book in itself. For example, the spine of the exhibition correlates to the spine of a book. And, as visitors flip through the &quot;pages&quot;, a history unfolds, from the primitive presses of the industrial revolution and the surrealist fetish objects of the 1930s to the art books for social change produced by the 1960s conceptualists, to the Codex computerised books of the information age. Simultaneously, Artists' Books offers a literal (sometimes literary, but primarily visual) kaleidoscope of concept and craftsmanship, proving the old adage that a book should not be judged simply by its cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artists' Books is on show at the Johannesburg Art Gallery in Joubert Park until October 27</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Okwui Enwezor is the man chosen to steer the South African community into the 1997 Johannesburg Biennale. The Nigerian-born, New York- bred poet, publisher, critic and independent curator was the unanimous favourite among the (as yet unspecified) list of South African contenders for the title of artistic director of the 1997 Biennale. But his appointment has been accompanied by a cloud of confusion over the future of South Africa's second international art extravaganza.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher Till, who spearheaded the first biennale in 1995, has been replaced as Johannesburg's director of culture by Victor Modise, previously of the Gauteng legislature. Supporters of the controversial art event are concerned that Modise may relegate the biennale to the back burner in favour of more pressing cultural development priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And questions are being asked -- Enwezor's undisputed cultural credentials and the international nature of the event notwithstanding -- whether a home- grown candidate should have been chosen instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The founding editor of Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art, Enwezor has written and lectured extensively on contemporary art discourse throughout the world. He has contributed to prestigious art publications such as Flash Art, Atlantica and Third Text. At the recent African Studies Association conference in Orlando, Florida, he co-organised a panel on postmodernism and critical methodologies, as well as chairing a panel on African artists at the ACASA Triennale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to having numerous curatorial notches in his belt of achievement, he sits on the advisory board of the Foundation Art Gallery, as well as the Sankofa Visual Art Centre in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, in the true nomadic spirit of postmodernism, his vision for the 1997 Biennale incorporates the theme of Trade Routes: History and Geography. Using the confluence of the Atlantic and Indian oceans in Cape Town as his metaphoric entry point, Trade Routes aims to embark on a literal mapping of the historical channels of commerce, examining various cultural resettlements and the ways in which they have relocated or dislocated during the enduring events of the cultural diaspora. The role of Africa, in particular, and notions of national identity will be explored in terms of their position within the late 20th-century scheme of things.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Finality on Bantu Holomisa's status as an African National Congress (ANC) member could be reached as early as next week. The ANC National Executive Committee (NEC), which must hear Holomisa's appeal against his expulsion by a disciplinary committee, is scheduled to meet following the Constitutional Court's judgment on Friday on the new Constitution. If the text is referred back to the Constitutional Assembly for amendment, as it is expected it will be, the NEC will have to give its ANC negotiators a fresh mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that Holomisa's appeal will be dealt with at the same time, as ANC leaders want to conclude the matter as soon as possible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC is also now moving to brief members at branch level to dispel perceptions that Holomisa is being made a scapegoat. The Gauteng region of the ANC has called a meeting of the chairpersons and secretaries of its branches alliance partners the South African Communist Party (SACP) and Cosatu and the South African National Civic Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are concerns within the ANC that branch leadership, left out of the information loop and under pressure from grassroots members unhappy with the action against Holomisa, could act out of line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move follows a protest by Soweto ANC members outside Shell House last Friday when Holomisa arrived for his disciplinary hearing, and his invitation, in contravention of ANC instructions, to speak at a rally in Thokoza on Sunday. This week the ANC Youth League, the ANC branch in Thokoza and the SACP all scurried to disassociate themselves from staging the rally or inviting Holomisa to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are fears within the organisation that one section of the alliance could be used against the other: ground-level leaders often wear more than one hat, and the Thokoza rally's ANC organisers are understood to have defended themselves by saying it took place under SACP auspices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng ANC provincial secretary Paul Matshatile said Monday night's meeting would be addressed by Gauteng premier and ANC provincial chair, Tokyo Sexwale. &quot;When people are not briefed it is easy for them to formulate the opinion that someone has been victimised,&quot; he said. &quot;It is important we have this meeting so that the leadership can explain to the people, who only know what they have been reading in the newspapers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While regional leadership has been kept informed about the reasons for Holomisa's disciplinary action, this has not filtered through adequately to ground level. Talk on buses, trains and taxis is no accurate measure of the true facts of a matter, but can indicate the depth of people's understanding and their mood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While debate is fierce, many people feel they have lost, in Holomisa, a politician in touch with and able to articulate their concerns in a new political paradigm that has seen a gulf open between people and party, and party and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter written to the ANC's parliamentary caucus by an active Guguletu ANC member this week spoke for many: writing as a &quot;loyal and disciplined member&quot; of the ANC, Theo Nkohla said he was disturbed by developments taking place in his organisation. No explanation was given to structures when Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was dismissed as deputy minister; now Holomisa had been expelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We only hear from the media, who give us their own version. Is the ANC now elected by the media?&quot; He and others were left to speculate that &quot;the only sin&quot; Holomisa committed was &quot;to speak the truth&quot; before the truth commission &quot; but for him it was a death sentence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa retains his seat as an MP but has officially been expelled as a member of the party. The ANC will inform Parliament of his expulsion only once it has been upheld by the NEC, however, as the interim Constitution which says an expelled member of a party must lose his seat has no mechanism for reinstating a member once his seat has been vacated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This clarification came on Tuesday, after disciplinary committee chair, Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya announced that Holomisa would not be allowed to take up his seat. Only hours after the release of the statement, however, ANC chief whip the Rev Arnold Stofile said Holomisa's expulsion as an ANC member was also on hold pending his appeal.  This is not the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Ethiopian community in Toronto, Canada, have joined their compatriots in other parts of the world in urging the immediate return of the Aksum obelisk looted by Mussolini in 1937, and not yet returned in accordance with the Italian Peace Treaty of 1937.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Executive Director of the Ethiopian Association in Toronto, Inc., Ato Noah Amberber, has written on matter to the Italian ambassador in Addis Ababa, His Excellency Mr. Maurizio Melani.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his letter he says:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am sure that Your Excellency is very much aware of the fact that this pride of Ethiopians was looted on the personal orders of the dictator Benito Mussolini, under whose misrule both Ethiopia and Italy suffered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am appealing to Your Excellency directly to take this matter up, and to restore the obelisk to its rightful owner, Ethiopia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development the &quot;Voice&quot;, the principal black newspaper in London, quoted a spokesman of the Addis Ababa-based Aksum Obelisk Return Committee as demanding the obelisk's restitution, and declaring: &quot;It is a crying shame that the Italian government have kept it so long. We are always prepared to wait for justice, but when it becomes a matter of 50 years, we become impatient&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - When there is going to be real and significant economic growth in Ethiopia, politicians will not have to sacrifice their &quot;precious&quot; time of intrigue and machination to unduly trumpet it on the mass media, because economic growth would be everywhere for all to see and observe. In fact, once real and appreciable economic growth is set in motion, its momentum could so propel it as to impose the necessity of reining it in to avoid overheating, as once, in recent years, was the case in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When shall we say there is such growth in Ethiopia? When the Ethiopian economy is launched on a clear-cut growth path, partisan politicians and bureaucrats will not need to take turns at trying to convince the public that there has been growth; the public will already have long noticed it. In such a situation, there may be conflicting economic statistics, but the public would not believe them if they do not point in the direction of growth.  People would be filled with hope and enthusiasm and would be looking for jobs and finding them most of the time; they would almost ceaselessly talk about their shopping plans and mortgages, which would materialize soon enough; The whole country, especially cities and towns, would bustle with the frenetic tempo of physical and non-physical economic activity; for sure, there would be a construction, especially a housing construction boom, cranes would menacingly dangle in the sky everywhere as concrete mixers clink and clank down below; the hustle and bustle of kerb-vending, hawking and formal trading would be such as to be literally palpable; in the countryside, commercial farming would flourish with an eye not only to the domestic market, but also to markets beyond national frontiers; streets would be congested with human and vehicle traffic; in short, the whole country, especially its cities and towns, would be abuzz with the magical commotion wrought by the invisible hand (thanks be to the genius of Adam Smith who gave us that immortal term!)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have you seen such a vibrant commotion in Ethiopia in recent years in places other than the &quot;Merkato&quot; in Addis Ababa and a few other such trading spots elsewhere in the country? Although it has its ebbs and flows, the &quot; Merkato&quot; has always been a scene of commercial mayhem irrespective of the type of political regime in power. So, if things were so radically different now from what they were in the past as far as economic activity is concerned, then we would have not just the same one &quot;Merkato&quot;, but several &quot;Merkatos&quot; in Addis Ababa as well as in other places where economic activity tended to converge on. During the first few years after the seizure of political power by the EPRDF, the incumbent political group, there was an unprecedented burst of kerb-vending and hawking in the country, most noticeably in Addis Ababa.  Many had come to believe that this was the beginning of the magic of the invisible hand at work, and that before long it would spread to every facet and scale of economic activity being carried out in the country. But, alas, the politicians thought this was too much a sign of the manifesto of the market-based economy they were professing to rally behind, and so they gave it a blow on the head with a police truncheon it could never quite recover from! It hasn't to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How then could there be real economic growth in Ethiopia if the people's fledgling impulse to truck and barter is so thoughtlessly nipped in the bud?  Every human being is naturally endowed with the instinct to struggle for survival; so the direct or indirect production of food, clothing and shelter is something nobody of working age can possibly dispense with. It would thus be a crime to bar anybody from any kind of legitimate production activity geared to answer this basic natural imperative on any legal or other pretext; legal order may be brought to the potential chaos that could emerge from the raw struggle for survival, but the struggle itself cannot and should not be stopped. In fact, one of the basic functions of government is to guide and encourage this basic struggle; to draw up the rules of the game so it does not descend into chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But try to struggle for survival in Ethiopia and see what you meet Ton the way. Imagine a penniless but able-bodied twenty-year-old lad who has just thought of planting trees for firewood and housing construction as an indirect production activity geared to earning money for food, clothing and shelter. He walks up to the relevant branch of government and pleads thus:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've noticed there is a serious shortage of fuelwood in town. I have the basic knowledge and skill to plant trees and make them grow. I need a piece of land to do that. Could I please have it as a grant from the government.&quot; The long arm of the state would reply with obvious disdain:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What makes you think you can have land just like that? &quot;Grant&quot;, did you say? You must be the wisest fool I have ever come across. How could you have anything for nothing? Don't you know that land is valuable state property and that you need money to enter yourself for a land auction and lease it. Even if you had the money, you would have to wait until the government got in the mood to want to put on a land auction!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disappointed lad may be smart enough to talk back as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You tried to bamboozle the people into believing that land is a gift of nature and should therefore not command a price and be owned by private individuals. You then proceeded to endorse what you predecessor regime did to dispossess the people of their land. But now you are leasing land for unChristian and unIslamic fees, ensuring that these fees remain so by maintaining a monopoly on land ownership! Let me tell you one thing. I am of planet earth. I am a terrestrial creature who does not know where he came from and where he is going, but I know I must survive here on planet earth, and for that I need land-a bit of planet earth!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what is all this sentimental rhetoric to the long arm of the state? In under-developed countries, the state survives by controlling the means of survival. So it is not going to weep for the individual who is trying to have a share in the control of these means of survival!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This then is what must change. The state must realize that it can increase the resources at its disposal only by nourishing the struggle of the individual for survival; by enabling its citizens to be so motivated by the primordial instinct of survival as to work hard, be creative, productive and efficient. At each stage of development, the means of survival change. A telephone is not an absolute necessity here in Ethiopia at present, but in the United States of America a person without one is seriously handicapped!  At this point, it can quite safely be presumed that the message here is clear: the motive power of economic development is the individual's drive to survive at each stage of human progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When then shall we say there is growth in Ethiopia? Consider the following major yardsticks:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* When the state begins to genuinely help every individual or group to make a living;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* When citizens have unencumbered access to land for a price or free of charge, depending on their present financial conditions;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* When, by the joint efforts of the state and the people, individuals or groups have easy access to: relevant and quality education, health services, credit and foreign exchange;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* When the state provides efficient services associated with: property and commercial legislation and its enforcement, registration, licensing, supervision, customs clearance, and the like;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* When the state succeeds in building an expanding network of rural and urban roads and nation-wide telecommunications and power exchanges and stations, and water supply systems;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the next few years, we shall be able to know whether the above-mentioned policies have been adopted by keeping an eye on the following key physical indicators:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An increase in the percentage of the irrigation-based farmland from the present estimated less than 5 percent of the total to 10, 15 and 25 percent;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A visible increase in commercial crop production, tree planting and animal breeding;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A significant rise in the total volume of exports and the introduction of at least two major new export products on a sustainable basis;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A boom in the housing construction sector, especially in Addis Ababa and other major towns in the country;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The completion of the following major government development projects: Gilgel-Gibe hydropower project; Fincha Sugar Factory; Gode, Alwero and Agelele-Bolhamo irrigation projects; Limestone factory project; 12-town drinking water projects; Most of the major rural and urban road construction projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, here is a famous election campaign credo to wake us all up: &quot;It is the economy, stupid!&quot; You just might want to guess who said it!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in neighbouring Somalia does not seem to be favouring Ethiopians doing business there. Since the recent military action taken by a contingent Ethiopian force 75km into Somalia, more than half a dozen Ethiopian business men have been shot dead in Mogadishu said BBC. Vehicles carrying commercial goods to Ethiopia have also been ambushed on the way. So far no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somali businessmen and intellectuals have condemned the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Road Accidents Are Inevitable Considering ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Traffic bureau has placed the blame on the rise in the number of accidents, on the Addis Ababa's inadequate and often faulty traffic lights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Addis Lisan, region 14 official newspaper, the picture looks quite dismal. Not only is the number of traffic lights inadequate, but out of the city's existing 23 traffic lights, two were completely out of order while the rest did not have all three colours in working order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper quoted Captain Zewdu Bayeh of the traffic bureau who said that only one traffic light in the city had a working yellow light, making it hard work for drivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The captain noted that nothing was being done by the Traffic System Office within the Ministry of Work and Urban Planning to make sure that traffic lights were in order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Told To Be Wary of Illegal Aliens</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Central Police Bureau has issued a statement concerning new measures taken to combat terrorism, reported Addis Lisan, Region 14 official newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From now on, individuals are expected to check the papers of all foreigners, to see if they are legal residents, before renting out houses or vehicles.  The paper quoted Ato Getachew Woldesemayat, the bureau's public relation officer, who said that the public's participation was needed to make any headway in the fight against the recent insurgence of terrorism in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He furthermore warned against what he called carelessness witnessed at the time of the Wabe Shebelle Hotel bombing. Police patrols have been stationed around Addis Ababa. Special training has also been given to security personnels of the city's 26 big hotels, as well as to those employed in Kebeles, governmental and private organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mystery Abductions Get Noticed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports are coming in from various sources regarding the disappearance of citizens. Twenty-nine people have been named by the Berlin-based Solidarity Committee for Ethiopian Political Prisoners, however their whereabouts remain unknown, said the private Amharic weekly, Tobia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same paper quoted the Ethiopian Human Rights Council stating that in its report two months ago, 115 people have so far been abducted. Eighty-six people were from Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was said to have denied all knowledge of these happenings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Wednesday, September 11, 1996 is the beginning of the Ethiopian New Year. WE WISH ALL OUR READERS A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the people of Ethiopia, this is the time year for reflection - for looking back on the past year but also for looking ahead to the challenges we face with the beginning of a new year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty eight years ago, Robert Kennedy said, &quot;The youthfulness I speak of is not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over love of ease....It does not accept the failures of today as a reason for cruelties of tomorrow. It believes that one man can make a difference - and that men of goodwill, working together, can grasp the future and mold it to our will.&quot; One of the challenges for 1989 is for the Ethiopian people to understand how to work together. To understand that what we need in Ethiopia is not division; what we need in Ethiopia is not hatred; what we need in Ethiopia is not violence or lawlessness, but love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, regardless of their ethnic background or political outlook.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Little good seems to have come out of Tuesday's mass demonstration, staged by the business community in Addis. In a rare show of unity, a large number of shops around the city closed down, as owners took to the streets in protest against the new rents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a BBC report, the police put the number of demonstrators at 150,000, while the organisers claimed a turn out of half a million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators objected to the rent increases on the grounds that the regulations were not well thought out, and have not taken into consideration their paying capacity. Their objections were totally ignored. The Office of the Prime Minister told them that it could not interfere in the region's business. The region 14 Council on its part, rejected the allegation saying the regulation was thoroughly studied before being implemented . It even went further and said that the premises of those who did not sign the new contract will be auctioned, reported ENA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 27,100 commercial houses, verandas, and such, will be affected by the new rent increases. Accordingly, rents will now be calculated on as much as 34 birr per square meter -- depending on which of the three &quot; grade&quot; classifications the kebele, in which the premise is located, falls under.  Tenants are therefore complaining that they are now asked to pay 12 times what they paid previously, while the region is contending that rent has now decreased by four times, said ENA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The region's right to raise the rent is also questioned by many who feel that the properties that were confiscated by the previous government, should be returned to the rightful owners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Nobody seems to know exactly how much the country's outstanding external debt is. Several figures are cited, some including rouble-denominated debt owed mainly to the former Soviet Union, some excluding it. In a recent press release, Ethiopia's Finance Minister, H.E.  Ato Sufian Ahmed, put the country's non-rouble external debt outstanding at only 3 billion US dollars or about 19.0 billion birr at the current rate of exchange (&quot;The Ethiopian Herald&quot;, Aug. 29, 1996). Dr. Befekadu Degufe, a well- known Ethiopian economist, cited the figure of about 28.7 billion birr for the magnitude of the non-rouble portion of the nation's foreign debt in an article he wrote in the Amharic monthly magazine &quot;Tobia&quot;, (4th year, No.9).  For what it indicates to be Ethiopia's US dollar-denominated external debt outstanding, the Planning and Research Dept. of the Ministry of Finance quotes the figure of roughly 4.4 billion US dollars or about 27.9 billion birr at the ruling rate of exchange. On the other hand, some IMF documents suggest that the country's total external debt outstanding (i.e., including the rouble- denominated part) is as high as nearly 60 billion birr. Official external debt statistics do not usually give figures on arrears, but these are estimated to be over 4 billion birr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confusion over the exact magnitude of the country's external debt outstanding and arrears is repeated in the computation of external debt/GDP, external debt/exports and debt service ratios. In the source indicated above, Ethiopia's Finance Minister cited the proportion of 47 percent for the country's debt service ratio, which relates the figure for the sum of annual interest and principal payments to annual foreign earnings from exports and non-factor services. Other statistics indicate external debt/GDP and debt service ratios of 73 and 34 percent, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However confusing the external debt statistics of the country, there is nonetheless no denying that: a) the country's total external debt burden is heavy; b) the debt has been increasing significantly over the past five years; c) the country has accumulated arrears because of its inability to service part of her debt; and d) the various debt burden indicators, including the debt service and debt/export ratios are quite high. Bilateral and multilateral creditors are at present considering a special initiative to help what they call heavily indebted poor countries, basing their decision to do so on the following major eligibility criteria:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A debt service ratio of over 25 percent; A debt/exports ratio of over 250 percent; Low per capita income; High creditworthiness; Adoption and implementation of an economic reform programme</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new debt relief initiative for heavily indebted poor countries may grant a reduction in the stock of debt owed to Paris Club creditors of up to 90 percent. In addition, the IMF and World Bank are expected to put together a debt relief programme for the first time to ease the burden of debt owed to them by these poor countries. Ethiopia is poised to benefit from the special debt reduction initiative on most of the eligibility criteria mentioned above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But why is the country's external debt burden increasing rather than easing under the incumbent government? Rising foreign debt under the Derg regime was understandable, because it was waging a protracted war. Isn't the EPRDF, the ruling political group, using foreign loans and credits effectively? Or is it because most of the development projects financed with these foreign loans and credits have not yet come on stream because of relatively long gestation periods? At any rate, the government has not so far newly conceived of and put up any high-profile development projects to its name like the Derg did with the Muger cement factory, the Melka-Wakana hydropower project and several other such large-scale development schemes. The government's much- vaunted agricultural extension programme is really nothing more than a massive fertilizer purchase and distribution scheme. The Addis Ababa ring- road project, which by the way is not a newly conceived one, has foundered.  Just to make sure, let us run through the major development projects which the current government still carries under its public investment programme and try to find anything big or new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here we go:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Gode irrigation scheme. Alwero irrigation scheme. Agelele Bolhamo irrigation project. Abayita Soda Ash factory. Gilgel-Gibe hydropower project.  Assab Oil Refinery Strengthening project. Fincha Sugar Factory. Hamaressa edible oil factory project. Tabor Ceramics factory. Limestone factory project.  Aluminium Sulphate factory. Pesticide Project. Addis Machine Tools Factory.  Mekele Business College. Ministry of Finance Office Building. Ministry of Information Office Building. Aksum Airport. Addis Ababa Water Supply Stage III. Arbaminch Textiles factory. Calub Gas Project. National Fertilizer Project . Tana Beles Water Regulation Dam Project. Sor, fiche and Debremarkos electricity project. Semer-Dawiat rural road project. Lalibela-Sekota road project. Awash-Mile road repair project. Aksum Television Station. Debrebrhan Television Station. Mekele Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, has there been anything new? There are a few, but none appear to command nation-wide importance. Mekele Business College and Institute projects and the Aksum television station project are among the new projects.  These are largely of regional importance. Some of the big projects started by the Derg which have still not been completed include: Angele-Bolhamo irrigation project; Gilgel-Gibe hydropower project; Fincha Sugar factory; Tana-Beles project</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the completed ones, the following deserve mention: Tabor Ceramics Factory; Aluminium Sulphate Factory; Calub Gas Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All in all, the new government has not so far come up with any new big public sector projects on the scale of the Melka-Wakana hydropower or Fincha Sugar factory projects. Nor has it been able to complete large-scale projects such as the Gilgel-Gibe hydropower or Tana-Beles projects. Further, there is strong statistical evidence that development project expenditure is heavily skewed towards the Tigray region. For example, out of the total 17.2 billion birr investment capital approved by the Investment Office of Ethiopia from 1992 - 1996, over 18 percent or about 3.1 billion birr, is planned to be undertaken in Tigray, well over the 14 percent and 6 percent planned for the so-called Oromyia and Amhara Regions, respectively. Further, most of the new public sector projects appear to be concentrated in the Tigray region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more important question from a nation-wide perspective is: if there have been no public sector projects big enough to catch the eye, what has the government been doing with the increasing loans and credits it has been receiving from abroad? The total non-military external debt outstanding of the country is reported to have grown from slightly over 6 billion birr in 1989/90 (i.e. just before the downfall of the Derg) to nearly 29 billion birr in 1994/95. Part of the increase would be attributable to exchange rate changes, but still a lot of it is accounted for by quantitative increases.  Has the government been using some of the new foreign debt incurred for consumption? Finally, why is Ethiopia financing the Assab Oil Refinery strengthening project? As Ethiopia is paying substantial fees for reining services, any investment expenditure should be borne by the proprietor of the Refinery. By the way, who is auditing the country's capital budget expenditure?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - The Zambian high court Tuesday discharged two of the eight accused opposition leaders charged with treason, after the director of public prosecutions entered a nolle prosequi against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DPP, Gregory Phiri, appealed to the court to discharge Muhabi Lungu, former President Kenneth Kaunda's press assistant, and Rabbison Chongo, central committee member for finance in the United National Independence Party (UNIP).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phiri said, however, that the state had only decided to enter a nolle prosequi to discharge the two and not acquit them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was submitting before Lusaka high court judge Peter Chitengi in the ongoing treason trial of eight members of UNIP who have been charged with treason and murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight have been accused of belonging to the clandestine group called 'Black Mamba' that claimed responsibility for the bomb blasts that occurred between April and June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have also been charged with the murder of a police officer who died in one of the bomb explosions at Lusaka international airport on June 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Chitengi warned the two that their discharge did not mean they had been acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was jubilation by UNIP members and sympathizers when justice Chitengi discharged the two accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with PANA, one of the accused, Lungu, expressed disappointment that the DPP only discharged him and Chongo when a state witness who implicated him in the charge had mentioned five accused persons as the people he saw at distant at Kaunda's residence and UNIP headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is sad that the DPP has only decided to discharge the two of us when in fact the state witness who linked us to the charge also mentioned UNIP vice- president senior chief Inyambo Yeta and Morris Kaulungo'ombe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial continues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The widely-read monthly, which focused on political, social and economic developments on the continent, was produced in London by renowned Nigerian Journalist, Peter Enahoro.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in an interview that the magazine had gone off the newsstands because of cash flow problems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi - Joachim Ruhuna, the catholic archbishop of Gitega, in Central Burundi, is feared to have been killed in an ambush laid by armed gangs in the locality of Mubarazi Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, military sources said in Bujumbura Tuesday that the prelate's body and those of his driver and a nun, believed to have been killed in the same ambush, had not yet been found.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources said the archbishop's burnt out clothes and vehicle have been found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political and church leaders in Bujumbura said Archbishop Ruhuna was a &quot; very strong moral personality who played a catalytic role in the search for a solution to the Burundian conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a long time, he was the target of armed gangs, the official phrase used for Hutu rebels, for his uncompromising views, sources said at the headquarters of the Confederation of Christian Churches in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other church leaders in Burundi, such as Bujumbura archbishop Simon Ntamwana, have survived several assassination attempts in a climate of ethnic violence and hatred, which has engulfed the central African country since the first democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was killed in an abortive coup attempt in October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndadaye's assassination by elements of the Tutsi-dominated army, sparked off the ongoing political and ethnic fighting between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis, in which more than 100,000 people have been killed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dakar, Senegal - Three trucks carrying food to revive nearly 5,000 severely malnourished children have arrived in the strife-torn Liberian jungle city of Tubmanburg, where more than half of the city's estimated population of 35,000 is suffering from extreme hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the children are near death, a news release from the World Food Programme said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight more trucks with emergency food supplies are expected to arrive Tuesday with another 74 tons, enough to feed 10,000 older children and adults for the next two weeks, the release said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supplies will follow as inhabitants who took to the jungle to seek edible leaves and nuts return to the city. The food is being distributed by staff of Medecins Sans Frontieres and Action Contre La Faim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Programme said that relief workers met devastating scenes as they entered the city, where factional fighting has prevented people leaving to farm or buy food. Since January, relief agencies have found it impossible to ship in supplies to the embattled city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is very bad,&quot; said Dipson Tulay, a World Food Programme aid monitor, who accompanied the first trucks into Tubmanburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One old woman could not even make it to the distribution center. She said she was tired, she could not walk very far. She dropped to the ground and died before our own eyes, just two yards from the distribution center,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The children are all malnourished, many have swollen hands, swollen feet and swollen belies and you can count their ribs. The people told us that for the past seven months they had been eating leaves, wild yams, palm nuts and palm cabbage in the jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also told us people were dying at the rate of 10 to 15 a day. From my own experience, I would say if we had not gone in when we did, the rate would soon have risen to 20 to 25 a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kordu Brown, a representative of a Liberian Christian relief organization working with the World Food Programme, Tuesday described the scene in Tubmanburg as &quot;horrible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never seen anything like it, except during the massacres in Monrovia,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were starving people everywhere. People were lying on the ground, a small child died right in front of my eyes. Even as we speak more people are dying there. Even experienced international relief officers broke into tears at the sight&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, World Food Programme officials warned that similar horrors may await them in other parts of Liberia cut off from food and relief for many months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange's (ZSE) revival continues as foreign investors respond to the recent announcement by the central bank they can increase their holdings in the equity market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZSE, which has seen foreign investors pour in nearly 300 million U.S.  dollars since June 1993, is enjoying a new lease of life after a seven-week lull during which there was heavy selling amid uncertainty about the future of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, in a bid to revive investor confidence, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe increased from 35 to 40 percent the maximum foreign investor participation on the ZSE, and from 5 to 10 percent the limit per every quoted counter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the announcement Sept. 4, the key industrial index has been breaking daily records, breaching the 6,000 point barrier for the first time on Sept.  3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the index, normally used as a barometer to measure economic performance, broke through the 6,500 mark, and ended the day amid active trading at 6,506.35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market analysts said the future looked bright for the ZSE, which was in 1993 labelled the world's worst performer by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) after it crashed by over 70 percent in value terms under the weight of a drought-induced recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, recovery has been dramatic, with the introduction of foreign investors in June 1993, providing much-needed incentive to the local bourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFC now lists the ZSE among its top five performing indices in the emerging world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sagit Stockbrokers said in a commentary Monday the bull-run on the ZSE had been partly fuelled by the fall in the inflation rate to 22 percent in July, and the reserve bank announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major counters to benefit were such blue-chip companies as Delta Corporation, where buyers increased the company's price from 27 zimdollars (2.  70 U.S. dollars) to 30 zimdollars (3 dollars) before dealing at 29 zimdollars (2.90 dollars); and the First Merchant Bank, whose share price went up from 30 zimdollars (3 dollars) to 35 zimdollars (3.50 dollars).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - The owner of Zimbabwe's largest underground gold mine has arranged a 40 million-U.S.-dollar financing package to provide much- needed working capital and reduce expensive debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana said in a statement Monday that the deal, reached with the Union Bank of Switzerland and the New York-based Dresdner Bank Metals group, would provide 28 million dollars for debt relief and another 12 million dollars to finance the expansion of the Freda Rebecca Mine near Harare.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financing has been structured as a seven-year pre-paid forward gold sale, with the gold delivery underwritten by Ashanti's parent company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashanti group treasurer, Mona Caesar-Addo, said the financing package, negotiated by Ashanti treasury staff, had been put in place to maximize cash- flow needed for future investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were looking for something better than a conventional gold loan which, even for borrowers of the highest standing, rarely extends beyond a five-year term. The advantages of this facility will enable the Zimbabwe subsidiary to prioritize its cash-flow for investment in the mine,&quot; She said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gold production at Freda Rebecca Mine, formerly owned by Cluff Resources PLC which was taken over by Ashanti in 1995, has in the past seven months increased by 8 percent to an annualized rate of 95,000 ounces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same period, a fourfold increase in exploration drilling has led to 19 percent increase in the mine's gold resource, and 17 percent increase in proven and probable reserves.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has rejected opposition demands for the repeal of the latest constitutional amendments, which bar former President Kenneth Kaunda from running for office in this year's scheduled presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking live on state radio and television Tuesday, Chiluba also refused to scrap the controversial national voters register prepared by Nikuv, a private Israeli firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that his Movement for Multiparty Democracy government was taking steps to de-link the electoral commission from government, as demanded by the opposition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also announced adjustments to the Public Order Act. He said that political parties will now need to give a seven-day notice to the police for meetings and other processions instead of the 14 days originally provided for under the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Electoral Commission will have three of their members appointed from among suitable qualified people like high court and supreme court judges, whose appointments shall be ratified by parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elections office, which is currently under the office of the vice- president, has been brought under the direct control of the Electoral Commission which is to enjoy autonomous status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition has demanded, among others, that this year's elections be held using the 1991 constitution and voters registers and national registration cards. They claim that the voters cards issued by Nikuv were produced from registers which contain numerous anomalies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Chiluba said Tuesday that he considered the 1991 voters registers as inappropriate. He said that many voters on the old registers could have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government appeals to all political players and interested parties to cooperate so as to build confidence in the final register despite the mistakes which have been detected so far,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba said that he would not suspend the controversial Constitution of Zambia Amendment Act 1996. Doing so, he said, would be acting against the wishes of the people who, he said, had petitioned in favor of an indigenous Zambian for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the new constitutional amendment, only Zambian-born citizens with both parents born in Zambia qualify for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law has been widely condemned by opposition parties, the church, private lawyers, donors and local civic organizations as undemocratic and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda has likened the law to &quot;apartheid&quot; and vowed that he would fight it as vigorously as he did against similar laws in apartheid South Africa and other neighbouring former colonial territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda boycotted scheduled second round of bilateral talks with Chiluba Monday, intended to defuse current political tension ahead of the elections.  Kaunda said it was futile to talk with Chiluba in the absence of other political leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since last week, Chiluba has been conducting a series of &quot;one-on-one&quot; consultations with the various political leaders including Kaunda whom he has met once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to Chiluba on Friday, Kaunda said that he could no longer continue bilateral talks and suggested that all the political leaders should meet the president at one meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda - An international workshop in Kampala has endorsed human trials of an HIV vaccine in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued at the end of the workshop Tuesday, said scientists believe the trials will help in the development of a future AIDS vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed trial of the ALVAC-HIV vaccine is to be conducted at the Joint Clinical Research Center in the Ugandan capital. No date has been set for the trials until legal, ethical and social aspects have been resolved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was proposed that up to 50 percent of the participants in the trials be women restrained from getting pregnant during the trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uganda's commitment to the vaccine trials is not a question of debate any more. But every interested party will be brought on board,&quot; Omwony Ojok, director-general of the Uganda AIDS Commission, told journalists at the end of the workshop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protestant church objected Monday to the trials if the safety of the participants is not guaranteed. But scientists at a press conference Tuesday said a person on ALVAC-HIV vaccine was safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The proposed vaccine has a very high safety record. It has undergone stringent tests in the United States and France, and has been scrutinised by Uganda scientists who concur that it's safe,&quot; Dr. P. Mugyenyi of the joint clinical research center said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparations for the trials have been going on for six years. Studies on 4, 600 soldiers in the last few years conducted by the center indicate vaccine acceptability of 82 percent among interviewers, scientists said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Approximately 1.9 million Ugandans are infected with HIV. The infection rate is 18-25 percent in urban areas and 4-10 percent in rural communities.  Development of an effective vaccine presents our greatest hope for stopping this terrible epidemic,&quot; Dr. Katongole Mbidde of the Uganda Cancer Institute said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports indicate that 50 volunteers will be identified for the trials who will receive four injections of the vaccine in the first phase. The second phase will include 100 to 200 people of high risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third phase will cover a large number of people usually over 1,000 to test the efficacy of the vaccine, said Professor Roy Mugerwa, the trials principal investigator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that a safety monitoring board will be set up and will include people who have no interest in the trials to guarantee independent and unbiased decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugerwa said a final decision of the trials will be made by the president of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Medi Kaggwa, a minister of state minister in the office of the president, reaffirmed the government's commitment to the vaccine trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ultimate weapon against the AIDS pandemic is a preventive vaccine that works well&quot; he told the participants at the closing of the workshop.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo - Malaria continues to be one of Africa's major health problems and a serious impediment to the continent's economic growth and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This view is contained in a report circulated in Brazzaville last week to delegates at the 46th session of the ministerial regional committee of the World Health Organization (WHO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, prepared by the Brazzaville-based WHO regional office for Africa, malaria is responsible for 30 percent of infant mortality on the continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization says it is concerned at the continent's deteriorating health situation characterized by mounting disease, suffering and death related to the loss of human potential, in spite of international aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides malaria, WHO mentions diarrhoea, respiratory diseases, measles and neonatal tetanus as other diseases which threaten the lives of millions of African children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also places HIV and AIDS, which had infected 12 million people in sub- Sahara Africa by the end of 1995, among the continent's health problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 75 million cases of curable cases of sexually transmitted diseases were also recorded in Africa in 1995. Sexually transmitted diseases have also become a principal cause of mortality, the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also highlights the fatal link between the Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV) and that of tuberculosis, which enhance the devastating effects of each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO urges governments to increase the population's access to reproductive health services. Currently, the report says, the continent's contraceptive utilization rate was less than 20 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also urges governments to undertake priority actions to meet the vast family planning needs and to reduce the continent's exceptionally high rates of maternal deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report wants governments to combat malnutrition. It says that at least 170 million people in Africa are under-nourished and that 30 percent of children below the age of five years are affected by protein deficiency, while many others suffered from anaemia due to iron and vitamin A deficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These deficiencies, the report adds, leads to serious health problems, impedes the intellectual growth of children and increases infant mortality rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malnutrition negatively affects the reproductive health of women and reduces the working capacity of adults, it says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo - Health ministers from 40 African states have appealed to eastern and central African governments observing an economic embargo against Burundi to ensure that vital products, especially medicine, reach the country's vulnerable groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeal features in a resolution adopted Tuesday in Brazzaville, by the 46th session of the Africa Regional Committee of the World Health Organization, which opened in the Congolese capital, Brazzaville, last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers urged the WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Ebrahim Samba, to help Burundi obtain &quot;all the necessary humanitarian assistance&quot; and protect the health conditions of the Burundian population &quot;in the name of African solidarity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting encouraged Samba to continue his consultations with the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity to ensure that vital products earmarked for vulnerable groups were exempted from the embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zaire and Zambia imposed a stringent economic embargo against landlocked Burundi following a military coup in Bujumbura on July 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the resolution, the health ministers specified that the most vulnerable groups likely to suffer from the embargo were women, children, the elderly, the sick and displaced people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the resolution, Burundi's health minister, Juma Mohamed Bariburyo, said it was not a victory for his military government as such but a basis for the resumption of emergency health work, including immunization, the protection of pregnant women and other patients, which had been suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's neighbors, who met in Arusha, northern Tanzania Sept.6 to evaluate the impact of sanctions, decided to loosen the embargo on medicines and humanitarian assistance to the country's displaced persons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - Academic life remained uncertain in Nigeria Wednesday, 24 hours after the expiry of the military government's seven-day ultimatum to striking university lecturers to resume work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from across the country indicated that despite the ultimatum which included a warning to eject defiant lecturers from their official quarters, lectures have yet to resume in most of the nation's 38 state-run universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exceptions were the University of Technology, Minna, in the northern state of Niger and the University of Benin in the mid-west.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of the university of Benin, the vice-chancellor was reported to have picked up the chalk to teach a course in a bid to encourage the reluctant teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities of the university at Minna claimed that nearly all teachers had signed to resume classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other campuses where partial academic work was reported included the University of Bauchi and the University of Sokoto, both in northern Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But reports from the northern state of Kawara said some 291 lecturers of the University of Ilorin have resigned en masse and requested the authorities to pay their entitlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to the university registrar after a meeting on Monday, the teachers said &quot;the academic staff of this university (Ilorin) are ready to disengage from the services of the university once our entitlement are settled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the University of Lagos, the situation remained fluid, with some teachers who are willing to teach complaining of poor attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a class of about 80 students, only about 10 usually turn up,&quot; one lecturer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-month crisis followed the strike called April 9, by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), which was demanding adequate funding of Nigerian universities and better pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When negotiations broke down, government proscribed the union and threatened to sack and eject the lecturers if they failed to return to classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of the banned union have criticized the government action, saying it would only aggravate the education crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, scores of Nigerian lecturers are reported to have fled the country in the wake of the crisis to seek better-paid employment abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers have warned that the situation could deteriorate further unless a negotiated solution is found to the dispute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Following is the statement by the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee on Burundi issued September 6, 1996, as transcribed by the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs Integrated Regional Information Network in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee composed of representatives of Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and OAU Secretariat met in Arusha, Tanzania on 6th September, 1996 to review the implementation of sanctions on Burundi. Zaire was not represented.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Committee welcomed the recently adopted UN Security Council Resolution 1072 (1996) strongly supporting the decision of the Arusha Regional Summit of 31st July, 1996 to impose economic sanctions against Burundi as well as efforts of the regional leaders, the OAU and the Facilitator of Burundi Peace talks to obtain a peaceful settlement to the Burundi crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Noting that the Buyoya regime had not met any of the conditions set by the Arusha II Summit of 31st July 1996, namely:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) The restoration of Parliament; (b) The unbanning of political parties; (c) The immediate and unconditional negotiations with all groups within and outside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee therefore, decided that the sanctions should be strictly maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Committee recalled the decision of the Ministerial meeting held in Kampala on 16th August, 1996 in which the issue of humanitarian supplies was examined and exemptions of human medicines and emergency basic food items for Rwandese refugees in Burundi was agreed upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In this regard, the Committee decided to address genuine humanitarian concerns in a manner that does not undermine the very essence of the sanctions. To that end, it considered and decided to allow, subject to strict verification and control arrangements, the importation by the UN agencies of the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(i) Baby foods and other essential requirements including personal hygiene provisions for infants and hospital patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(ii) Emergency medical and laboratory supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(iv) Limited quantities of kerosene for the cold chains for vaccines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Concerning the movement of personnel involved in genuine humanitarian activities and members of the diplomatic community resident in Burundi, the Committee decided to allow a restricted number of the UN flights to and from Bujumbura, co-ordinated by the Resident Co-ordinator of the UN System in Nairobi, and authorised by the Kenya National Sanctions Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The Committee also decided that emergency flights will be authorized by the National Sanctions Committees on a case by case basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. For the sole purpose of getting across humanitarian assistance to Burundi, the Committee decided to allow restricted road access to and from Burundi for personnel of the UN and other humanitarian agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. In order to facilitate the distribution of humanitarian supplies and the essential operations of the UN agencies and resident diplomatic corps in Burundi, the Committee decided to allow these agencies to import limited and controlled amounts of diesel and petrol for their own use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The Commitee decided to allow the UN Agencies to import communication equipment for their own use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The Committee commended all participating countries and the OAU for the solidarity and cohesion shown in strictly applying the sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. The Committee also commended the International Community for its support of the region in its search for a peaceful and lasting solution to the Burundi conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. The Committee expressed its appreciation to the Government of Tanzania for playing host to the meeting and for the hospitality accorded to al the delegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. The next meeting of the Regional Sanctions Co-ordinating Committee will be held in Kigali, Rwanda on 1 October 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6th September, 1996 Arusha, Tanzania.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - This is number 25 (2 - 8 September 1996) in a series of weekly reports from IRIN on general developments in the Great Lakes region. Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC) met for the first time on Friday and decided that sanctions on Burundi should be 'strictly maintained' while also agreeing to allow UN agencies to bring in emergency relief items, personnel and fuel to enable them to address 'genuine humanitarian concerns'. The decision to continue with sanctions was explicitly linked to the failure of the Buyoya regime to meet 'any of the conditions set by the Arusha II Summit of 31st July 1996, namely: (a) the restoration of Parliament; (b) the unbanning of political parties; (c) the immediate and unconditional negotiations with all groups within and outside the country.' Earlier in the week in a press conference in Nairobi, Julius Nyerere - former Tanzanian president and the main mediator in the peace talks - suggested that sanctions might be relaxed once Burundi's new regime began serious negotiations with Hutu rebels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RSCC decided to allow UN agencies to bring in 'baby foods and other essential requirements including personal hygiene provisions for infants and hospital patients', 'emergency medical and laboratory supplies' and 'limited quantities of kerosene for the cold chains for vaccines'. The Sanctions Committee also agreed to allow a restricted number of UN flights to and from Bujumbura, emergency flights to be authorized by the National Sanctions Committees on a case by case basis, restricted road access to and from Burundi for personnel from the UN and other humanitarian agencies, and crucially the importation by UN agencies and the resident diplomatic corps of 'limited and controlled' amounts of diesel and petrol for their own use. They will also be able to import communications equipment for their own use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move has been welcomed by UN agency spokespersons as a positive step.  The UN is currently seeking clarification regarding the process for NGOs seeking exemptions from the sanctions and how this process should relate to the UN's own arrangements. The next meeting of the Sanctions Committee is set to take place on October 1 in Kigali, Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Around 100 rebels were killed during several days of fighting between government forces and rebels on the outskirts of Bujumbura. The Burundi Army launched a sweep of the area on Wednesday after rebels lobbed mortar shells into the capital and shot into the air in the surrounding hills as part of a warning that &quot;they could attack the capital at any time&quot;. Two helicopter gun ships and a light plane armed with rockets and heavy machine guns were used by the Army during the sweep. The Army is reported to have lost three soldiers in the fighting. Aid workers said that more than 1,000 peasants fled from the hills during the operation to displaced persons camps in the capital.  Two sites on the northern outskirts of Bujumbura are now home to about 10, 000 displaced persons of Hutu ethnicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The World Food Programme (WFP) issued rations on Thursday to some 16,000 people affected by recent fighting in Kayanza province. Army reinforcements had been brought into the province following reports that rebels killed 10 people in a camp for displaced Tutsis, the local communal administrator and a soldier during an attack on Tuesday. By Thursday fighting was reported around Butwe, which is situated between the towns of Ngozi and Kayanza near the main Rwanda-Burundi highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel leaders said earlier in the week that they were trying to stop goods blocked by sanctions from being transported across the border from Rwanda. A truck carrying beer was ambushed near the western town of Rutegama and three people in the truck were killed. Some rebel activity was also reported to be taking place in the south of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Bujumbura lost two thirds of its electricity last week as a result of power lines being cut. The price of imported food has soared. Rebels have also been trying to persuade farmers not to take their produce to Bujumbura to sell in the markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Twenty-two FRODEBU parliamentarians resident in Tanzania issued a statement on Tuesday in which they expressed support for the armed opposition organized by the CNDD and FDD. The same day three FRODEBU members of parliament resident in Kenya issued a similar statement of support for the rebels. The three parliamentarians said that the 25 July coup which brought Major Buyoya to power had &quot;ended any chance of a political and peaceful solution to the Burundian conflict&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># A US air force C-141 flew 31 foreign residents out of Bujumbura on Wednesday. The flight included Americans, Belgians, Britons, French people, Indians, Pakistanis, South Africans and Tanzanians and they had to pay for their own seats. The plane left some 50 Americans working in Burundi, down from about 100 two months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Major Pierre Buyoya's wife and two children as well as three officials from the Burundi regime were forced to return to Bujumbura after having flown out of Burundi to Entebbe in Uganda. The officials had reportedly intended to deliver a message to the regional states and the family members were heading for Europe, but Uganda blocked their travel as part of the regional sanctions imposed on 31 July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Fourteen people were killed and more than 75 wounded in a hand grenade attack in Cyangugu on August 17, according to a UN HRFOR statement on Tuesday.  Spokeswoman Marie van der Elst said the deaths and injuries occured when unidentified attackers tossed three hand grenades into a market in Nyakabuye.  The UN HRFOR is undertaking investigations to try to determine who was responsible for the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># A Burkina Faso court on Wednesday turned down a request for the extradition of a Rwandan army officer accused of involvement in Rwanda's genocide in 1994. The court in Ouagadougou ruled against the public prosecutor's demand that Alphonse N'Teziliyayo be extradited to the International Tribunal in Arusha. Mr N'Teziliyayo, a lieutenant-colonel in Rwanda's former government army, has been accused by the Rwandan Government of being one the main leaders of the interahamwe and having supervised operations during the genocide in is his position as district commissioner of Butare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># WFP warned on Thursday that some 750,000 Rwandan refugees in Goma, eastern Zaire could face serious food shortages after the refugees boycotted a population census in the camps. A three-day count aimed at establishing the number of refugees in Goma was called off on Monday when refugees refused to cooperate. WFP said that donor countries had warned they would not fund further food supplies to the camps until the count had been carried out. Non- emergency services were suspended for three days by aid agencies following the boycott but by Thursday normal activities had resumed. Camp leaders said that refugees feared that the count was linked to recent agreements by Rwandan and Zaire officials to close the camps before elections in Zaire in the first half of next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Five Zaireans of Banyamulenge origin were killed last week by Zairean soldiers deployed in the hills around Uvira by the local authorities, according to reports from local people. One man was allegedly stoned to death in Uvira town, while four others were reported to have been killed in villages nearby. There have also been reports that a number of people were arrested in Uvira town and held in a military camp at Luberizi. Amoung those who have gone missing are Catholic and Protestant priests from the diocese of Uvira. The Banyamulenge are Zaireans of Tutsi ethnicity who migrated into the area from the historic kingdom of Rwanda over the course of several centuries.  They appear to be being targeted much as Zaireans of Tutsi ethnicity in North Kivu have been persecuted over recent months and forced to flee to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The Red Cross suspended its operation in eastern Zaire for one week on Sunday after two employees were killed and 34 injured in a land mine blast.  The incident happened on Saturday when a bus transporting Red Cross volunteers to Kibumba camp, north of Goma town, ran over a mine which had been planted on the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Mobutu Sese Seko, President of Zaire, had his Swiss visa extended to allow him to stay in Switzerland following his slow recovery from an operation for prostate cancer. It was also reported last week that Kengo wa Dondo, the Prime Minister of Zaire, had had an operation to remove a tumour when he visited Mobutu during the week beginning August 26. The visits have drawn attention to the millions of dollars allegedly owed to Swiss creditors by the Government and the Presidency. The unpaid bills relate to the rental of buildings used by Zaire's UN mission in Geneva, that of the Zairean embassy in Berne and a mansion for Mobutu being built on the shores of Lake Geneva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Georges Nzongola Ntalaja, the deputy chairman of Zaire's national electoral commission (CNE) resigned on Tuesday, blaming the Government for deliberately placing obstacles in the way of the elections. Nzongola, the representative of Etienne Tshisekedi's opposition movement on the CNE, said he deplored the climate of &quot;uncertainty and tension&quot; created by the inability of politicians to respect deadlines ahead of the elections due in the first half of next year, and accused the government of a &quot;lack of sincerity&quot;. He said that the current situation had made the work of the CNE &quot;very difficult, if not impossible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army killed about 40 people in attacks in the suburbs of Gulu town in northern Uganda last week, according to reports in the government-owned New Vision newspaper on Friday. The paper said that about 60 rebels attacked Koch Ongoko and Bungatira divisions of Gulu district on Wednesday, killing 10 people. This brought the number of deaths resulting from their attacks to about 40 since the previous Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The Tanzanian Government commission charged with investigating the May 21 ferry disaster on Lake Victoria issued a report on Friday accusing the ferry company of 'gross negligence'. The report into the acccident, which cost 700 lives, also blamed the Belgian Ship-Builders Corporation, which supplied the ship (MV Bukoba), the Tanzanian Railway Corporation and the Tanzanian Government. William Kusila, Transport and Communications Minister, said, &quot;It is not possible to pile all the blame on a single person... it is necessary to recognise the many factors that led to the accident in relation to each concerned party&quot;. Mr Kusila has ordered the resumption of police investigations into the accident in order to allow a presidential commission to further probe the disaster.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, D.C. - Fourteen U.S. relief and refugee-assistance agencies have urged President Clinton to take additional steps to avoid repetition in Burundi of the mass violence which took 500,000 to 1,000,000 lives in neighboring Rwanda two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an August 21 letter to the White House, the agencies asked the President to press U.S. allies to work more closely with African governments to cut off the flow of arms to the region and to stem cross border violence. The agencies also called for contingency plans to protect potential victims should diplomacy fail and more widespread violence erupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specific measures recommended included consultations between the U.S.  military and international organizations and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) operating in neighboring states to identify ways the U.S. military could help the humanitarian community meet critical refugees needs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agencies also called on the President to press U.S. allies to be prepared to provide ground troops for an intervention force should one have to be mobilized. In addition, the President was asked to go beyond the outstanding U.S. offer of logistic support for such a force and also to furnish modern equipment, training, and financial backing. The letter cites a recent University of Maryland poll indicating that two-thirds of the American public would favor even stronger U.S. action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of letter:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 21, 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President William J. Clinton The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20500</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. President:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing genocidal violence in Burundi, already responsible for an estimated 150,000 deaths, could accelerate to catastrophic levels without any further advance warning. We call on you, as President of the world's most powerful and influential nation, to take the steps necessary to forestall repetition of the tragedy which shamed the international community two years ago in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We appreciate the attention which senior members of your administration have been giving to the continuing crisis in Burundi, in particular the visits of Ambassador Albright and National Security Advisor Lake, as well as the recent personal involvement of Secretary Christopher. We also laud the generous assistance provided by the U.S. government to refugees in and from Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is apparent that the earnest preventive diplomatic efforts undertaken by the U.S. and key African leaders have not defused the situation.  The recent coup and subsequent embargo add to internal pressures which could tear the country apart. Both more vigorous American diplomacy to prevent such a blowup and realistic contingency planning for limiting the loss of human life if diplomacy fails will be welcomed by the millions of Americans who support our agencies' goals and operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several of Burundi's African neighbors have sought to facilitate an end to the violence with the backing of the Organization for African Unity. However, it has been difficult for them to deal with some of the key issues, including cross border violence and the continuing flow of arms to the area. The United States and allied governments with long-standing influence in the region have resources and leverage which should be committed to resolution of these problems. It is particularly important that the administration communicate to the leadership of the French government the great importance it attaches to collaborative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If widespread violence erupts in Burundi substantial population movements will occur. Neighboring states will be more willing to allow Burundians fleeing violence to find refuge on their territory if more affluent members of the international community have pledged financial and logistic support.  To prepare for such a contingency, we ask that in addition to conveying the appropriate assurances to the neighboring governments, you authorize the appropriate U.S. military commands to engage in consultations with the international organizations and NGOs operating in Tanzania and Zaire. The objective of these consultations would be to identify ways in which the U.S.  military could help meet critical refugee needs exceeding the response capabilities of the humanitarian community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are aware that the United Nations has tried to make contingency plans for intervention in the event that a collapse of governmental authority leads to even more widespread killing in Burundi. The need for such intervention will be essential if Burundi's neighbors do not permit refugee outflows.  However, it has become clear that no such intervention will occur unless the United States is prepared to play a role consistent with its power and influence. This role should go beyond that currently contemplated. The U.S.  should be encouraging commitments by U.S. allies of the ground forces needed to lead such an intervention. It also should indicate to African governments willing to contribute their troops to such a force that the U.S. will provide not only logistic support but modern equipment, training and financial backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian assistance and respect for human rights have long enjoyed strong bipartisan support among the American people and their political leaders. A survey published in July by the University of Maryland indicated that 66% of the American people would even favor contributing U.S. troops to a UN peacekeeping operation in Burundi should forces there engage in genocide.  The more modest effort we recommend would undoubtedly be well-received by the vast majority of our fellow Americans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - In a letter today (September 9), Human Rights Watch and the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) urged the Security Council to create an ad hoc international tribunal to prosecute those charged with massive human rights violations in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following is the text of the letter, addressed to the Council president, Ambassador Alfredo Cabral of Guinea-Bissau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch and Federation Internationale des Ligues des Droits de L'Homme (FIDH) welcomed Security Council Resolution 1012 in August 1995 to create a United Nations Commission of Inquiry for Burundi with the mandate to &quot;establish the facts relating to the assassination of the President of Burundi on 21 October 1993, the massacres and other related serious acts of violence which followed.&quot; As you may be aware, we sponsored, with several other organizations, the International Commission of Inquiry into Human Rights Violations in Burundi, which published a report in March 1994 concluding that important officers in the Burundi army were responsible for the assassination of President Ndadaye, that large numbers of Tutsi were killed by Hutu, sometimes under the leadership of local administrators, and that the army and police retaliated with massive killings of Hutu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our findings (referred to in the commission's report as the &quot;FIDH report&quot;) are frequently cited and largely confirmed by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry in its report published in August 1996 as document S/1996/682. However, after documenting the indiscriminate killing of civilians by the Burundian army and Gendarmerie and &quot;acts of genocide&quot; against the Tutsi which were instigated by officials and leaders of the FRODEBU party, the Commission reaches the shocking conclusion that &quot;(t)o make the suppression of impunity a precondition for the solution of the crisis is completely unrealistic and can serve only to give excuses to those who are unwilling to take the necessary actions.&quot; This conclusion contradicts completely both the letter and the spirit of Security Council Resolution 1012, which explicitly called for the commission to recommend legal, political and administrative measures to bring to justice those persons responsible for the acts and **to prevent any repetition of deeds similar to those investigated by the commission and, in general, to eradicate impunity..**.&quot; (emphasis added).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Security Council recognized in designing the mandate of the commission, the cycles of violence in Burundi cannot be stopped unless the impunity that has contributed to perpetrating human rights abuses is ended.  In a situation where fear increasingly motivates all actors, only the assurance that those guilty of serious abuses will be punished provides a reason for refraining from violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission acknowledged that international jurisdiction should be asserted to address the massacre of Tutsi, but assigns responsibility for prosecuting the army's indiscriminate attacks on Hutu exclusively to the national courts of Burundi. Given that such attacks by the army appear to constitute genocide under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as well as crimes against humanity, those cases should also be subject to international jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We urge the Security Council to disregard the conclusion of the commission and to uphold the principle clearly enunciated in Council Resolution 1012. To demonstrate that the Convention for the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as well as the customary international law concerning crimes against humanity have meaning, the Council should create a tribunal to prosecute those charged with these massive violations in Burundi. We therefore call on the Security Council to establish an ad-hoc international tribunal to prosecute those charged with massive human rights violations in Burundi. To maximize its deterrent effect, jurisdiction should include future such violations committed in the course of the current crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To turn away from such clear evidence of guilt would show the weakness of the Council in the face of human rights abuses that threaten international peace. It would also invite continuing violence not only in Burundi, but also elsewhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for you kind attention to this important matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States government welcomes the inauguration today in Monrovia of the new Liberian Council of State Chairperson, Ruth Perry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her selection, coupled with the other important decisions taken at the August 17 ECOWAS Committee of Nine Summit, offers renewed hope for the successful conclusion of the troubled peace process in Liberia. The United States urges all Liberians, especially the faction leaders, to seize this opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest Abuja Summit established an amended timetable for implementation of the 1995 peace accord and provides for an immediate cease-fire, disarmament and demobilization of factional fighters, and internationally supervised elections for a democratic civilian government by May 1997. The United States calls upon all faction leaders to honor their commitments made to ECOWAS leaders and to extend their full cooperation to the West African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG), humanitarian relief organizations, the United Nations and others working to support the peace process in Liberia. In addition, the United States commends ECOWAS leaders for creating a mechanism to verify compliance by Liberia's warring factions and for their stated readiness to take tough measures against faction leaders (who) fail to comply with Summit decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has strongly and consistently supported efforts to end the war and bring democratic governance to Liberia. We look forward to working with Chairperson Perry and the other Council members to support implementation of the peace process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - The White House has dispatched President Clinton's special envoy Paul Hare to Angola to press for progress in the peace process, according to a statement issued September 9, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is concerned by the lack of progress in the Angolan peace process over recent months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President has sent Special Envoy Ambassador Paul Hare to Angola to meet with President dos Santos and Dr. Savimbi to underscore American commitment to the fulfillment of the peace accords and concern over continuing delays. His trip follows a series of high-level discussions with Ambassador Donald Steinberg, who was in Washington last week for consultations. Ambassador Hare arrived in Angola today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Persistent delays in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol threaten to undermine the substantial progress achieved toward lasting peace and national reconciliation. The United States calls on the signatories of the Lusaka Protocol to take tangible steps toward achieving full military integration and formation of a government of national reconciliation in the coming weeks.  In particular, it is important at this stage that UNITA surrender its remaining heavy weapons and complete the quartering of its forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States welcomes the arrival in Luanda today of six UNITA generals, some of whom are among the initial ten senior generals to be integrated into the national military. This is an important step toward the full incorporation of UNITA's army into the Angolan Armed Forces. We also welcome the commitment of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA leader Dr. Jonas Savimbi to meet inside Angola within the next ten days.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This attack is one of many that Fotoform Printers has experienced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">over the years. The last attack on Fotoform was on April 30, 1993, when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police officers raided the premises, shut down the printers and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">impounded all of its equipment. At the time, Fotoform had been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">publishing the Economic Review magazine, Finance magazine and the now-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">defunct Society magazine. Shortly after that bombing, Dominic Martin,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - Hutu rebels killed Burundi's Roman catholic Archbishop Joachiam Ruhuna, ambushing his vehicle and setting it on fire, an army official told this writer by telephone. Citing the testimony of a cleric, Lieutenant Colonel lsai Nibizi said a deacon arrived on the scene at 5.30 pm on Monday shortly after the attack, to find the bodies of the Archbishop and a nun burning inside the four- wheel drive vehicle in a valley in the centre of this tiny central African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The deacon pulled the bodies of the archbishop and the nun out of the vehicle and went off to seek help&quot; Nihizi said.&quot;When he got back, the archbishop's body had disappeared&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army said six other people, including two nuns, were also ambushed as they drove through the troubled central province of Gitega. According to Nibizi, the deacon did not see any other bodies. &quot;The others may have been taken hostage&quot;, he said. By late Tuesday, only three bodies had been recovered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of the white missionary order who is close to the diocese said the archbishop's death-- which constituted the highest level assassination of a religious leader- since the outbreak of inter-ethnic violence in December 1993- had stirred up strong emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The papal Nuncio in Bujumbura had refused to comment on the death- simply said until the Holy Father Pope John Paul II has been informed officially.  Other sources said The holy father will probably celebrate mass in honour of Ruhuna and other victims of the attack, the sources added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source close to the archdiocese said the Archbishop left the parish of Gitonga at 5.OO p.m Monday on his way to a meeting at the seminary at Burasira. &quot;The rebels were waiting for him in Mubarazi valley&quot; between the two locations the disclosed. The rebels themselves blamed the Tutsi- dominated army for the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman- Jereme Ndiho, for the main rebel organisation, the National Council for the defence of Democracy said that as&quot;opposed to the rest of the catholic hierarchy- strongly pro-Tutsi and discriminatory-- Monsignor Ruhuna was a man of reconciliation&quot; &quot;You have to look at who benefits from this crime&quot; he said. &quot;we have no interest in the disappearance of such a constructive personality.&quot; Ruhuna was born in October 27, 1933 and was raised like any African rural boy. He was ordained on 8, September 1962 and was named bishop of Ruhugi in 1973 consecrated the same year appointed co-adjutor of Gitega in 1980 and made Archbishop 6 November 1982.. The 62 yr old cleric was travelling without an armed escort in Gitega province one of the most embattled in Burundi, which has been in the grip of bitter inter ethnic fighting for three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1993 the rebels have been locked in a civil war with the army which has left more than 150,000 people dead, mostly civilians, according to Africa watch report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A diocesan priest from the diocese of Gitega who has since fled to Nairobi and working in one of the Kenya catholic diocese told me in an interview that the Archbishop had received numerous death threats after celebrating a mass in July for about hundreds massacred in the Bugendana area, during which he criticized extremists on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, was also present at the mass, but fled in his helicopter after an enraged crowd started throwing stones at him. That evening, Ntinbantunganya took refuge in the US ambassadors residence where he remains, and two days later. Tutsi army major Pierre Buyoya retook power in a bloodless coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon Ntamwana, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Bunjumbura said the attack against the Archbishop as &quot;extremely serious aggression against the Church&quot; He said Ruhuna was &quot; a very moderate man who had sought dialogue and fraternity and who was not involved in politics&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l don't think it was necessary to condemn him to death like that&quot; he said, recalling that Ruhuna escaped death by inches when the vehicle in which he was travelling was ambushed by Hutu rebels near Bujumbura in September 1995.  Seventy percent of Burundis 5.9 million people are Christians, the vast majority of them Roman Catholic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 12 Roman Catholic clerics have been assassinated in Burundi since a coup attempt in October 1993 in which the country's first Hutu President Melchior Ndadaye was murdered. Buyoya, who had been president from 1993 until being ousted in an election by Ndadaye, said he took over this time&quot; to save Burundi from Chaos and genocide&quot; but neighbouring countries are blockading Burundi in a bid to force him to negotiate with the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi, a republic since 1966, near the equator in East-Central Africa, has its capital at Bunjumbura. The first permanent Catholic mission station was established late in the 19th century. Large numbers of persons were received into the church following the ordination of the first Burundi priests in 1925.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first native bishop was appointed in 1959. Most education takes place in schools under catholic auspices. 1972-73, the country was torn by tribal warfare between the Tutsis was torn by tribal warfare between the Tutsis the ruling minority, and the Hutu. Burundi maintains diplomatic relations with Vatican city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Make way, lads -- the lasses want more of the game -- a report on the quiet revolution in the coverage of sport that's raising the profile of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is 4.46pm on Saturday and the first results come tripping out of the teleprinter. Des, Trev, Gary and Stubbsy are familiar faces as the post-match analysis begins to wind its way into the night. Over on Radio 5, British radio personality David Mellor prepares to take up the mantle voice of the people on his regular 6.06 show. All very laddish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's a revolution afoot, lads: the lasses are hot on your tails.  Take the best-selling football mags in Britain: the weekly 90 Minutes is edited by a woman, Eleanor Levy, while the first, and easily most successful (80 000+ circulation) of the new magazines, FourFourTwo is run by founding editor Karen Buchanan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadsheets, too, have seen an influx of new talent, with young pretenders like the Observer's Amy Lawrence joining such legendary veterans as Julie Welch. Even Football Focus, formerly the preserve of suave ex-pros, has its female face now, tough-talking Scot Hazel Irvine. And Radio 5, the football fans' favourite station, is effectively fronted every Saturday afternoon by the much-respected Eleanor Oldroyd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not just in football that the profile of the female sports journalist has risen. Laura Thompson, author of a best-selling book on horse racing; Kate Battersby, one of the most versatile of Britain's sports writers; and Sue Barker, Des Lynam's only serious rival in the smooth-links stakes at the Olympics, have all proved that the days when women did the odd bit of commentary at Wimbledon are long gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's Olympics coverage -- with Hazel Irvine, Virginia Wade and Sharon Davies also on hand -- could possibly have been regarded as a watershed in women's long march through this most male of environments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a far cry from the days when Julie Welch, now a sports writer for the Sunday Telegraph, first walked into a football press box more than 20 years ago. The striking scenes in her semi-autobiographical film, The Glory, Glory Days said it all: dejected look on her face, no one to talk to, unable to get a phone to put through her copy, she looked every inch the lone woman in a man's world. &quot;For the first few weeks it was all right. They thought 'She'll go away soon',&quot; she recalls. &quot;But when they realised I wasn't, they started to think 'What is this woman doing in our preserve?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first 10 years of Welch's football career were the loneliest of her life. It is easier now because there is weight in numbers. There is also a new generation of male sports writers who are more open to the idea of working alongside women on an equal basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is still a male world but it's a much nicer world because you are part of the furniture,&quot; Welch says. &quot;And if I've done nothing else, I was responsible for getting women's toilets installed in the press box.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new female writers such as Amy Lawrence can only imagine what Julie Welch endured. &quot;You do feel under pressure at first to prove your worth,&quot; says Lawrence, &quot;but that goes for men and women. Once it's clear that you love the game and know what you are talking about you will be taken seriously.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sun sports writer Janine Self agrees: &quot;Journalists judge each other on actually doing a job. Once you are in that situation they decide whether or not you are up to the task.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working on a tabloid, where building and sustaining relationships is crucial to the all-important exclusive, is one of the hardest jobs for a female journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the stories come from whispers in corridors. The lads get the big stories when they go out night-clubbing with the players. If I go up to a player and suggest going out for a drink it could be misinterpreted,&quot; Self says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But being a woman can bring some advantages. &quot;Men find it hard to be rude to women. So even if a player doesn't want to talk to anyone after a game, he might tell the men to get lost but he won't say that to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Gibson, sports editor of the Sunday Telegraph, says women writers are known on the circuit as &quot;fluffies&quot; -- light and bubbly, but lacking substance.  But because they are at least initially isolated from the pack, they find their own distinctive style, which gives their work a freshness some male writers lack. He should know: he regularly employs an impressive line-up of female writers including Welch, Claire Middleton, Judith Palmer, Lewine Mair and Cathy Harris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women look for the human interest angle,&quot; says Sun sports reporter Vikki Orvice. &quot;You don't necessarily focus on the player, you don't go straight into the football, so you get a broader view. You write about what someone said on the way to the ground, the music that was playing or something funny that happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although women do write match reports -- Louise Taylor of the Times is reckoned to be one of the best analysts of the game -- it is in the feature format that they excel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Daily Telegraph's Sue Mott, 1996 sports feature writer of the year, Sunday Times golf correspondent Lauren St John and Sarah Edworthy of the Telegraph are all a dab hand at interpreting that amorphous thing called mood.  And with the growth in coverage of sport both within the regular sports pages of national papers and in new pull-out sections, the feature article and keynote interview have new space to flower in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While opportunities have been brought by the proliferation of sports supplements, particularly in football writing, far fewer women get to write about rugby league, horse racing or boxing. And there is still a dearth of female journalists stuck writing about women's sports like netball, hockey and lacrosse. &quot;I'm not bitter and twisted,&quot; says Claire Middleton, &quot;but I do feel typecast -- 'Here's a women's sport, Claire can do that'.&quot; In fact she would like to tackle football or rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the profile of female sports writers continues to grow, it can only serve to reinforce the idea that women generally can be knowledgeable about sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Eleanor Oldroyd says: &quot;If a woman is in a pub and her boyfriend is talking over her, and refuses to let her make her point, she can challenge him: 'How can you say women don't know anything about football? Radio 5 employs women to present their football shows'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But breaking into commentating has not been so easy for women. The Murray Walkers and Geoff Boycotts look set to dominate for the foreseeable future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to commentate at local level to then go on and do it at a national standard,&quot; says Charlotte Nicol, Radio 5's football producer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if women did come through at local level it would be a daunting prospect. &quot;There would be so much pressure on the first woman commentator, she really would be exposed to criticism.&quot; And with a perceptible shiver, Nicol added: &quot;Thank God it won't be me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being reflective about sport is not simply a female trait. Soccer star Ruud Gullit's popularity soared during Euro 96 because he waxed lyrical as a commentator about the philosophy of football, describing and comparing different styles of play in stark contrast to the more traditional approach of, say, Alan Hansen. It is surely not accidental that it took someone outside Britain's football establishment -- a black, dreadlocked Dutchman --- to add a different perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who come from outside a specific sporting culture can add a new dimension. &quot;It's not always necessary to be incredibly knowledgeable about football,&quot; says Emily Boulting, producer of Sky Sports' Soccer AM, &quot;There's room for more entertainment-led programmes, for people who aren't obsessed with facts and figures.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - On Monday this week the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa (BCCSA) heard two submissions from the public which challenged the South African Broadcasting Corporation's revolutionary broadcasting of controversial gender material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What linked the hearings was South African society's staunchest taboo's -- the frank discussion of female genitalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The catalysts for outrage were prizewinning artwork by Kaolin Thompson called Useful Objects -- the scarlet ceramic vagina with cigarette resting at its centre -- debated in SABC 2's Focus of August 20. And SABC 1's two-part documentary Abortion -- The Last Resort screened on August 13 and 20. The coincidence highlighted the BCCSA's role as guardian of non-reactionary morality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the average 850 000 complaints received by the SABC annually, the BCCSA hears about 100. Hearings are purposely conducted in an informal manner, making them less intimidating for public complainants as well as emphasising the commission's status as a recognised but not legal forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Procedure is simple and reasonably brief. The offending material is screened, after which both complainant and defendant are each allowed a maximum of 20 minutes in which to state their case before being questioned by the panel. (Owing to the casual convening of Monday's hearings, the punctual women from the pro-life Women's Social Upliftment League there for the second objection, were inadvertently exposed to Useful Objects -- twice.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first hearing, Focus presenter Max du Preez, to whom the complainant Colin McGuinness had referred in his letter as &quot;that grinning idiot&quot; and &quot;pervert&quot;, appeared rushed, irritated and ready to defend his journalistic integrity as well as his ego. The complainant, a seemingly affable and surprisingly seedy looking man, was of a nervous rather than vitriolic demeanour which defied the prudish tone of his missive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In need of a soothing smoke, McGuinness and his companion were pulled up on an ashtray issue themselves when BCCSA commissioner Dr Caroline White suggested they either make final use of the plain white ceramic vessel on the table before them, or leave the non-smoking area. The complainant was compliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGuinness began his verbal submission with an apology to Du Preez for the abuse directed at him personally. The general manager of the SABC's central complaints office, Malan Otto, then read out an eloquent submission which lent integrity to the Focus debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGuinness argued that not only was the &quot;so-called artwork&quot; offensive to women, but that its artistic value was questionable, saying that &quot;anyone could have made it, given a piece of clay&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Dr Rex Mathie stated that he, for one, could not have done so.  McGuinness said the close-up of the ashtray had looked like a &quot;gyne shot ...  The closer it got, the worse it looked.&quot; Du Preez argued the importance of zooming in on the Gauloise Blond cigarette rather than the vagina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Censorship and viewer warnings were discussed, and everyone had their say, as proceedings progressed in a measured and civilised tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same can't be said of the second hearing. The agitator, however, was not the neat, ad-hoc Women's Social Upliftment League complainant. The heckling pro-life contingent was led instead by an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">un-named middle-aged woman in flowing floral with demented hair and a face that seemed to express a thousand furious thoughts every minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the screening of Abortion -- The Last Resort began, the anonymous Bodecia planted herself firmly behind BCCSA chairperson Kobus van Rooyen, for a more advantageous perspective, and proceeded to huff and shake her way through the viewing. Once both half-hour episodes of the documentary were over, the protester returned to her seat. Momentarily relieved, the chair attempted to proceed as usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the unsuspecting representative for the formal complainant was still being coaxed to complain, the furious lady in floral punched the air and demanded to be heard. Her interruption was cut short by Van Rooyen, who braved rebuffing the aberrant contingent with some details of official procedure; that is, only complaints already received in writing may be heard at the hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After some persuading, a hush fell and the correct pro-life representative calmly reiterated her league's feelings on what they considered to be nothing short of a pro-choice film which has &quot;used&quot; the SABC to &quot;present lies to the public&quot;. The league therefore proposed that the least the SABC could do was to redress the imbalance allegedly created by the film by commissioning a pro- life programme of equal length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film, in fact, showed a variety of opinions from both sides, but focused more on real abortion issues (that is, women who had had abortions) than moral debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC argued that Abortion --The Last Resort was not a pro-choice production, while the aberrant contingent snorted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Dr Mathie, principal of Rosebank Bible College, pleaded for a rational, compassionate response from the complainant, she remained unmoved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, film producer Ingrid Gavshon offered film participant Sister Sheila Mary, a Catholic nun, as an example of positive pro-life response to the film. The complainant ignored this comment, as did the hecklers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue was too emotional to be argued rationally and once the hearing was adjourned, fire and brimstone hailed down upon the heads of the SABC and BCCSA alike, and they were damned as promoters of &quot;death and destruction&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BCCSA panel, however, ruled in favour of Gavshon on the basis that the programme was insightful on the issues relating to abortion and was not a for- and-against debate about the topic of abortion or the phenomenon of abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;the programme was an excellent piece of television journalism which was an honest effort to bring enlightenment and did not seek to solicit support for any legislation that is now before Parliament,&quot; the panel said in its finding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that all aspects of abortion were dealt with and contrary viewpoints &quot;fairly represented&quot; resulting in a &quot;balanced and fair&quot; programme.  Gavshon was also noted for her &quot;sensitive, insightful handling&quot; of the topic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There were full-page advertisements with the editor's mugshot and personal signature. There were posters across the Cape Peninsula.  And there was a 10-day count down to when the newspaper's makeover was unveiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when The Argus was relaunched as the Cape Argus, it certainly did not blow everyone's mind, as differing opinions exist on whether the colourful masthead works.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also debate on whether a &quot;relaunch&quot; constitutes more than just a change in masthead and typefaces; or if it includes adapting editorial content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media observers and representatives from respected local advertising agencies are divided on their impressions of the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The managing director of Jupiter Drawing Room in Cape Town, Kevan Aspoas, says he &quot;hated&quot; the new masthead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I regard the Argus as a noble publication with integrity, but the new look has negated the heritage of the newspaper. Changing a newspaper's look should reflect the quality of the publication as well as its traditions. The new masthead does neither,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the page layout is &quot;refreshing&quot;, the use of &quot;Cape&quot; in the masthead &quot;certainly does not work&quot;, argues Aspoas. He says it creates the impression that the idea for a revamp &quot;was born from a research group who sat in a room and decided that the newspaper has to be geographically specific without considering other important factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People read newspapers because they regard them as somewhat credible publications. The new masthead has no impact and looks cheap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aspoas, however, admits that the newspaper has &quot;a lot more colour and better use of visuals&quot;, but is adamant that it has gone too far in trying to rid itself of an age-old stuffy look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Argus editor Shaun Johnson disagrees. He says the newspaper has not lost any of its heritage as the first publication printed in 1857 had the same masthead as the revamped newspaper carries today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only 20 years ago did the newspaper become The Argus. I have remained traditionalist in several areas, but have been modernist in my design.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, local newspapers should not purport to be national . The Cape Argus is being steered towards becoming a polished regional newspaper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson says the design by United States specialist Mario Garcia is at the cutting edge in world trends, claiming that circulation has increased and readers' responses are positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor George Claassen from Stellenbosch University's Journalism faculty, however, agrees with Aspoas. Claassen argues that the Cape Argus is not a &quot; serious paper of record&quot;, and changing its masthead, he says, is not going to do the trick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the newspaper is more &quot;visually attractive and reader-friendly&quot;, Claassen argues that there is a lack of quality feature journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigative articles, he says, are not apparent in the Cape Argus, but this is a problem facing most local newspapers who no longer regard investigative articles as essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson counters that the makeover is not merely cosmetic, but that the content has also improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claassen disagrees: &quot;Newspapers have become hooked on sound bites, and their excuse remains that people have no time to read. On the contrary, people will make time if they are presented with a quality newspaper article.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob Meintjes, a journalism lecturer at the Pensinsula Technikon, says content is as important as redesign. &quot;Relaunching is not just about packaging, but maximum impact relies on good writing,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi managing director in Cape Town, Neil Gurney, says its more than just good writing that captures a market. &quot;It's catering for the needs of your local readers that is important,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the name change was &quot;shocking&quot;, the innovation displayed by Johnson captured Gurney's attention. &quot;The newspaper has tapped into what is important locally, such as having detailed reports on the weather, using graphics and giving Capetonian readers what they regard as important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gurney says the new-look is &quot;cleaner&quot;, but admits that the editorial content is not that different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charisse Tabak, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's media director in Cape Town, says the newspaper's layout is a &quot;vast improvement&quot;. It is clear that the Independent Group -- parent company of the Cape Argus -- has spent a lot of its money on the cosmetic revamp, she says, but &quot;whether the editorial side of things improves, remains to be seen&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will take some time before readers become accustomed to the new look, argues Tabak, but the circulation figures in six months' time will reflect whether readers are pleased with both content and design.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media department head at Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising agency in Cape Town, Lucinda Dare, says the masthead is &quot;bright and visible&quot; and the overall use of fonts and layout is fresh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new look, I believe, will not lose appeal, but will succeed in retaining that part of the market which we cater for,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dare is optimistic that the relaunch is the start of bigger and better things for the Cape Argus, but like most advertisers she says the change and improvement on the editorial side, admittedly a slow process, remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Deputy president Thabo Mbeki's task group on government communications -- Comtask -- will recommend that the South African Communications Services (Sacs) be dissolved and replaced with a new and much leaner government structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will allow for a &quot;more streamlined professional body&quot; to disseminate information concerning the government, says Comtask convenor Mandla Langa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four major print conglomerates -- Nasionale Pers, Perskor, Independent Newspapers and Times Media Limited (TML) -- will also be scrutinised when the operations conducted by these print stables are brought to the attention of the Competition Board. The board works under the auspices of the Department of Trade and Industry, which is considering drawing up new competition legislation, possibly anti-trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with some Comtask members, the Mail &amp; Guardian got an idea of what the group's findings will be. The report promises to be a heavyweight compilation of impressions, recommendations and alternatives offered by members of the team, as well as the input and concerns of stakeholders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comtask believes the Competition Board, or the committee reviewing competition legislation, could assist the team with its brief on foreign ownership and diversity in the media by placing the spotlight on those print stables believed to have unlimited clout and an unfair advantage in the press industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task group was commissioned by Mbeki earlier this year to investigate the relationship between the media and government and the effect foreign ownership has had on the diversity of local media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that Comtask is concerned about the stranglehold held by, among others, Independent Newspapers and TML. Comtask members are concerned with the distribution bases of the print stables. Langa says Comtask's findings will be referred to the Competition Board in an effort to flag the state of the print industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depending on the legislation drafted, legal measures could possibly be taken against those print groups believed to be in control of the print and publishing arena, but this route may be a last resort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he cautioned that the recommendations regarding Sacs and the print stables had to be &quot;discussed further&quot;, and possibly amended, once all the responses are gathered and studied at Comtask's colloquium in the first week in October. The colloquium involves getting feedback from various stakeholders, government departments and several broadcasting and print groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The responses to Comtask's findings will be debated again, before the report is finalised and handed over to Mbeki in mid-October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operations of the four major print groups involve the publishing, printing and distribution of newspapers. Concern is mounting that it is only a handful of large newspaper houses which appear to dominate and control all three practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comtask is focusing its attention on distribution and who is responsible for this task. The team found that in the English press the dominant player in printing and distribution is Independent Newspapers. The stable has its publishing done by Allied Publishing, a company partly owned by TML.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one task team member put it: &quot;The reason we are interested in distribution is because it can so easily be a controlling mechanism.  Distribution can be seen as a gateway to the dissemination of material.  Diversity in the print media is not possible unless the gateway of distributing dailies and weeklies is not vested in the hands of a select few players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having a hold over distribution is having effective control of who comes into the newspaper arena and what material goes out and where that material goes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current publishing and distribution practices carried out by the four print houses could possibly be tested when the new competition legislation is drafted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the finer details of when the findings will be referred to the board still have to be thrashed out. Langa stressed that no formal relationship will be developed with the board, but that the intention of the task group is merely to draw the board's attention to the situation prevailing in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent group deputy chief executive Ivan Fallon says the &quot;stranglehold theory is absolute crap peddled by the Mail &amp; Guardian&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fallon argues that the group does not have as many printing presses as other stables and that Allied Publishing is a not a money-making mechanism, but a necessary operation which is costly and complex and in line with international press operations. Independent owns five printing presses in Gauteng, three in Durban and three in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langa says Comtask members are aware that the control of distribution goes hand-in-hand with having the economic clout and can only work on a &quot;co- operative basis&quot;, but who wields the economic clout has to be examined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says although Comtask was aware that some newspapers' holding companies were offshore, it also recognised that some stables were at the forefront of black empowerment. &quot;Although some groups push black frontiers, they have to at the same time take cognisance of a need for equity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Print media is also &quot;far too white&quot;, which created a &quot;disturbing picture&quot; as newspapers catered for multitudes of people, the majority of whom are black in South Africa, says Langa. This imbalance would be addressed in Comtask's report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As concerns Sacs, the idea is to streamline with more professionals on board -- the expertise, if necessary, drawn from talented people outside of the government, Langa says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The perception of one task team member is that Sacs consisted of &quot;hangers- on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was considerable debate on the future of Sacs as it was found that in most instances there was duplication of tasks. Expertise is also needed at Sacs as most of the people employed are not sufficiently trained to be doing the job that they are doing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is apparantly an insecurity prevailing among Sacs staffers who have the option to resign and accept a package -- if they do, they are prohibited by law from working for the government again. Staffers can choose to remain at Sacs and be part of the transformation, but it is believed that the positions they currently hold are not guaranteed. Staffers will have to reapply for their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langa says Comtask investigated internationally and locally the pros and cons of having a ministry of information directly linked to the government and concluded that &quot;it will not be proper for South Africa&quot;. He says international trends indicated that bulky departments of information are no longer operational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trend is towards much smaller communications structures (with competent people),&quot; he says, adding that government departments and various ministries had to buck-up and become more efficient with less bureaucracy. &quot; We have to develop streamlined communication facilities to be in line internationally,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attitude of the media also had to be addressed, says Langa. &quot;Age-old fossilised thinking'' apparent in most reports published in local dailies and weeklies has to be seriously addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media, he says, tends to quote mostly white people, developing a situation of &quot;unrecognised disempowerment&quot;. This, Langa explains, is when reporters consciously or sub-consiously choose to illustrate the points of white people in senior positions rather than those opinions of black people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; A rethink of our own attitudes has to take place,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A partnership, Langa argues, has to develop between the government and the media. However, this did not mean that the press has to &quot;jump into bed with the government and consummate its relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, no, no. It means that the relationship, if not amicable, has to be one of accurately informing the public of what is happening. The media can no longer operate from a premise of false assumptions, but will have to ensure that it carries well-researched articles based on fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has to ensure that its responses to media inquiries are more timeous, while the press has to strive towards producing more analytical material that is well-informed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - The decision by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) the Basle-based central bankers' club, to widen its membership to include nine emerging market countries, represents a critical milestone for the global economic order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been evident since the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) 50th anniversary meetings in Madrid in 1994 that the richer industrial countries can no longer cajole or bully their developing country counterparts to order, any more than they can prevent the export of jobs to Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, however, emerging market nations have had real difficulty in making it to the top table. The efforts to redistribute quotas, the equivalent of shares, to newcomers has stalled. Germany continues to block the sale of IMF gold to support debt forgiveness for the poorest countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the richer countries are willing to allow the newly emerging surplus nations, like Singapore, to join their emergency funding facility, they still continue to balk at allowing the newcomers to join in discussions of broader issues, such as credit risk in the banking system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the inherent conservatism of the BIS, which is best known for developing rules designed to underpin the safety of bank balance sheets, it is perhaps the last place most people would have looked for reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quietly, however, its general manager, Andrew Crockett, has been working behind the scenes to widen the franchise. He has changed the nature of BIS monthly meetings, to give a wider group of central bankers the chance to air their views. Now he has been successful in winning places for them on the BIS board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new intake will include the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the People's Bank of China, Banco Central do Brasil, Reserve Bank of India, Banco de Mexico, the Russian central bank and the Saudi Arabian and Singapore monetary authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the newcomers will now be able to directly influence the views of the G10 leading industrial countries. Moreover, by drawing countries like Singapore into the net, it should be easier to ensure their co-operation in future banking crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Membership of the BIS will bring with it status but also greater global responsibilities. The BIS -- set up in the wake of the World War II as a payments organisation for German reparations -- has, in effect, become the first global financial institution of the 21st century.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The high-pressure environment at Liberty Life is getting to Kyle and Wesley. It's only 11am and already they're at blows. It happens often these days, say staff, looking on wearily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyle and Wesley are two of the more than 50 children who come to work with their parents every day to stay at Liberty's creche in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. Liberty Life is among the first of South Africa's corporations to provide childcare at work as an added benefit for the employees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trend has grown in the United States and it's likely to be imported into South Africa as trade unions and educationists begin marketing the concept of having &quot;boardroom babies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Liberty Life's creche is no bland, bare boardroom. It's a state-of-the- art creche with colourful murals, the best toys and equipment and oodles of TLC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our standards are high,&quot; says principal Brenda Havenga. She employs 22 staffers, most of whom are highly qualified. They all attend regular refresher courses to stay at the cutting edge of pre-school care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The creche is designed to get working mothers back on the job soon after the accepted maternity period of three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Havenga accepts babies from two months old and keeps them until they're three. &quot;After that we encourage parents to find schools in the communities.&quot; Spaces are booked well in advance -- over 40 pregnant mothers have already reserved their places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babies are placed in the nursery until they can walk, when they graduate to the toddlers group and then finally to the play-group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is a downside to this creche it's the absence of a dirt and grass outdoor playground. Security concerns and the surrounding concrete environment made the creche's architects decide not to build outdoors.  Instead, the little ones romp to the strains of &quot;Old McDonald had a farm&quot; in a space called the inside-outdoor area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They play in sandpits, a water-trough and an Israeli gym with hundreds of different bits. There are also lots of swings, slides and little cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although tempting, the parents of the older children don't come downstairs all the time. &quot;It would be too disruptive,&quot; says Havenga. &quot;But the parents of babies can come down as many times as they like. The mothers are more productive. When they're away from the child, there's lots of concern, especially from first-time mothers,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberty Life's state-of-the-art care comes with a reasonable price-tag. It costs R450 a month; though this amount is substantially subsidised by the company. In addition, a limited number of baby bursaries are available for staffers who can't pay the fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lobbying For Childcare In The Workplace (Sidebar)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda Adams of Corporate Childcare leads the pack in lobbying for the provision of childcare at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's knocked at the doors of this country's major corporations to get them to start creches. Her perseverance is paying off. &quot;More companies are requesting feasibility studies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberty Life creche is one of three that Adams and her partner, Dillys de Leiburne, have started in South Africa. It's a deluxe centre, though creches can be designed according to what a company can afford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams recommends that corporations contract out creche management to organisations like hers &quot;because we understand that corporate companies are not in the childcare business&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labour Department could soon turn its attention to childcare at work.  There is no legislation on the subject, though senior officials are set to assess international standards on the issue when they visit the International Labour Organisation soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a new issue in South Africa,&quot; says a Labour Department representative.  The department inherited this area of work from the Welfare Department. &quot;We are planning a survey on (workers') access to care-givers and the role of care-givers,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams says creches should not only be seen as social responsibility exercises. They can often be run profitably and are of &quot;strategic value&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They can be used to head-hunt key skills of men and women.&quot; And most importantly the creche can serve as an incentive to keep well-trained, professional women staffers who often have to opt out of the job market to raise their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kudos for creches usually come from mothers, but Adams has found that fathers benefit too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it's a father who works at the company with a creche, &quot;he has the opportunity to become actively involved in the growth and development of their children,&quot; says Adams.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Fears that the country will lose the essential skills of its scientists, engineers and technicians is driving a government investigation into the brain-drain from the public sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the science and technology division of the Arts, Culture, Science and Technology Department has already launched a formal investigation into its skills losses, other government departments are clamouring for a broader investigation into the loss of skills in all areas in the public sector, and losses inflicted on the country by emigration in the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Rob Adam, deputy director general of the department, a ministers' meeting chaired by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki agreed that the department's investigation should be regarded as a pilot study for a much broader look at the brain-drain next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pilot study has been contracted out to Deloitte &amp; Touche at a cost of R74 000. Preliminary results will be ready by the beginning of November.  Questionnaires will be sent to engineers, scientists and technologists who have left the public sector, to find out how they are employed and whether they intend to emigrate. So far this year, 142 engineers and related technologists have emigrated; last year 319 emigrated and in 1994, 393 emigrated, according to the Central Statistical Service. Nobody has any data on how many of those were from the public sector. But the government is worried, and not just about the emigres.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hear horror stories of nuclear scientists who used to work for the government now running fish-and-chip shops or pool-cleaning services, and while they may be contributing to the economy, their experience and expertise in nuclear science has been lost to the country,&quot; said Arno Webb of the science and technology division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the shift in the government's priorities had led to the loss in the public sector of numerous skilled people in defence and scientific research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we discussed this investigation in the ministers' meeting, other departments said 'hey, you guys are not the only ones', and suggested this study should be broadened to include the whole public service,&quot; said Adam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Webb said there was a move to set up a system to maintain links with skilled people who had emigrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if they have left the country, their skills do not have to be lost to the country,&quot; he said. &quot; We could perhaps create a data base of South African experts abroad and these people could be brought in for research or for certain projects. Other countries have done this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This investigation sits uncomfortably with the public sector's drive to shed 300 000 employees over the next three years, to cut the wage bill. Part of the strategy is to offer voluntary retrenchment packages, which can only be granted if they are &quot;in the interests of the state&quot;. The voluntary package programme has been launched without any real assessment of its impact on the service's capacity to deliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director general of the public service, Dr Paseko Ncholo, said they were hoping, through this programme, to retain skilled people in the public service and shed the dead wood, partly by changing the culture of the public service, and partly by offering market-related salaries at the top-end of the service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, government officials and outside observers are sceptical, believing the government may be closing the stable door only after the horse has bolted. Sources in the Department of Finance say they are concerned that the voluntary packages will encourage skilled people to take what they can get and run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reconstruction and Development Programme monitor Gavin Lewis said this week: &quot;They are in trouble because they are losing people at the provincial level and many of those people, whatever their past political allegiances, have got considerable technical experience ... only a foolish white male in his 40s would not seize a voluntary package with both hands, because his career prospects in the service are grim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that in the area of housing, the capacity to deliver according to the housing programmes is being severely hampered by the loss of skilled people, to the extent it is actually going to cripple delivery in all but two of the provinces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said last week that 905 of his staff had been granted permission to take early retirement, many of whom were senior public servants. In answer to a question by Democratic Party MP Ken Andrew in Parliament, Manuel said his department had lost a deputy director general, four directors, two deputy directors and three assistant directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Revenue Service had lost a deputy director general, three chief directors, eight directors and 39 deputy directors. A number of computer personnel had also received packages, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) this week gave notice that it was losing patience with the way the African National Congress-led government, in its rush to attract foreign investment, was failing to consult its old alliance partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Secretary Sam Shilowa told the parliamentary finance committee that it was &quot;unacceptable&quot; that Cosatu had been given a very limited time to comment on the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill before it was tabled in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To add insult to injury, Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus claimed that the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) had been extensively consulted about the proposed new tax changes, including tax holidays, since 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shilowa produced a letter from Nedlac chamber co-ordinator Shan Ramburuth that proved &quot;there has in fact been little discussion (on this) at Nedlac. We do not want to enter into any squabble about who is right and who is wrong, but that does indicate that there are some areas where it will be important, as part of building participatory democracy in lawmaking, to be able to take into account that there was a problem with the way in which the process was handled,&quot; Shilowa said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu expressed strong reservations about the proposed tax holidays for new investments and recommended changes to the proposed legislation that would ensure tax holidays would not disadvantage existing investments and that details of all applications be subject to hearings before they were granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also asked that the government guarantee that tax holidays should not be compensated for by increases in value-added tax, a decrease in the number of zero-rated items or higher taxes for low income earners while tax holidays remained in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The key thing we want to raise is to first make clear that ... we are opposed to the issue of tax holidays, but we have not come here to argue that we should not implement them,&quot; Shilowa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have come here to inform you that if we had things our way, that is what we would do, but that we take account of the fact that there is a decision to move in that particular direction and therefore we are here to raise our concerns and put forward proposals which we hope will be able to be taken on board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a finance bill, however, it cannot by convention be changed by the committee, which has to either accept or reject it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shilowa said that despite this, he hoped that the amendments could be accepted. &quot;It would be unfortunate ... if our recommendations ... were just to be thrown out,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu's main objections to tax holidays are that they incorrectly rely on tax incentives to channel private sector investment, would erode the tax base and would shift the burden of taxation from the rich to the poor. They could also disadvantage existing investments and lead to job losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shilowa recommended that the committee launch a public investigation into the range of options that could be considered to mobilise public investment and create jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shilowa said this would help &quot;avoid an ad hoc situation like this one in which we try to deal with a comprehensive, complex situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have got a responsibility as lawmakers to ensure that at least the process of participation is itself not denied,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accepted that at times there would be legislation that had &quot;to be rushed through ... but it is not like waking up in the morning and saying you need some legislation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policymakers started planning months ahead of any situation and that was the time when they should consult the committee, Nedlac and other parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Richard Branson is a firm believer in capitalism, but with one exception -- a national lottery. The British entrepreneur, in Johannesburg last week to garner publicity for the inaugural flight of Virgin Airlines, was adamant that South Africa should not follow the British route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Putting a monopoly in charge of running a national lottery gives it a licence to print money; they can't go wrong. Look at Camelot (the British operator) -- it made Pounds 100-million profit in its first year of operation.  When you consider the few pounds that individuals raise for charities on an annual basis, that is a huge amount of money to go to waste.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That profit would have been better spent ploughed back into projects to benefit the public. After all, it is the poorest who play the most -- so they must be seen to be getting something back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branson has been approached by the South Africans for advice on how to run a lottery -- but he fears the worst: &quot;I have a horrible feeling South Africa will follow the British route. It would be a tragedy if a foreign company were to come in and cream-off millions in profits when South Africa so desperately needs those funds for regenerating the economy. I would love to be able to ensure this country does the right thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a lotteries authority has yet to be established in this country, the former Lotteries and Gambling Board has presented the government with three reports containing various recommendations, says Pieter Erasmus, director general, department of trade and industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board also submitted a Lotteries Bill, which probably will be considered in the current parliamentary session. It provides for the establishment of a national lottery, owned by the state and run by a private company, as well as small, private and society lotteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin will soon appoint consultants to evaluate existing draft legislation for the lottery; conduct market research on potential turnover; recommend staffing for the National Lottery Board; and recommend an operator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign and local advisers have shown considerable interest, says the department, but &quot;due consideration will be given to all relevant factors before a final decision on the appointment is taken&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Erasmus says criticism of the British model will be &quot;duly considered in the licence contract to conduct the National Lottery. The consultants' report on a possible lottery turnover will give an indication of which part of society will be the biggest lottery players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British, says Branson, were blinded by dogma, hell-bent on private enterprise no matter the consequences or cost to the supposed beneficiaries.  His disillusionment runs deep: he was one of the bidders for the right to run Britain's lottery, but lost out to Camelot, despite his non-profit-making platform. His venture would have seen every penny of profit handed back to charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branson's solution would be to hire the best chief executive in the world -- John Fitzpatrick, who runs the Irish lottery, is a good role model -- and give him or her every bit of help and incentive to run the business profitably. But because the company is a monopoly, every care has to be taken to ensure maximum efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a sense now in Britain that the lottery is tainted; it has become associated with greed, because of the size of the payouts and the profits made by Camelot. No longer is it seen as working for the good of the disadvantaged alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been warned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Trade and industry minister Alec Erwin has confirmed that long-awaited discussions over the new competition legislation begin in the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) today (Friday), two years after the government first drew up plans for a new framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Erwin: &quot;In terms of an agreement reached between Nedlac and (former trade minister) Trevor Manuel, the basic policy framework of competition policy will be discussed in Nedlac, starting today. To the extent that consensus can be reached, this will be incorporated in the draft bill.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bill itself would then go through the parliamentary process. It is the government's responsibility in Nedlac to represent its policy position. The strength of Nedlac is that crucial constituencies influenced by legislation can provide input to that legislation -- which invariably improves its efficacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations are bound to be sensitive, with the business constituency particularly keen to protect its interests. &quot;It would be naive (for us) to think that business will not try to influence or hamper the process since competition policy -- as a body of laws -- affects them directly,&quot; says Department of Trade and Industry representative Ismail Lagardien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the department is determined to open up the economy to greater competition, in a bid to encourage greater dynamism and adaptability.  Its watchwords are transparency and accessibility, removing red-tape and over- regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much for the broad goals; the detail was left very much up to Erwin himself, with some input from outside the department. Erwin is keen to emphasise measures to bring in new competition -- as are key unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while there is no fundamental difference in the objectives set out by Manuel and Erwin, it was hoped that this time the policy would take a more holistic approach, incorporating a range of associated issues, including small business and taxation, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But negotiation is very much key to the process. Says Erwin: &quot;It is now possible through the system of public hearings in parliament for all viewpoints to be heard in a very transparent manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Accordingly, we get the benefits of hindsight of those directly affected by legislation interacting with the government, and parliament retains its role as the guardian of all possible interests in the legislation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But too much talk could delay action further. Amid speculation of battles between the old and new guards, there is a school of thought that believes the government should have gone ahead and implemented its plan as it did with the macro-economic strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erwin disagrees: &quot;Competition policy is not a macro-economic issue, but an institutional matter that is part of broader economic policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Lagardien: &quot;Competition policy is a very broad, very delicate and extremely complex process, which needs a thorough approach to achieve maximum efficacy.&quot; And besides, the Nedlac Act of 1994 stipulates that Nedlac consider all significant changes to social and economic policy before it is implemented and introduced to Parliament.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Scepticism about the reliability of South Africa's statistics is spreading to inflation figures in the wake of repeated complaints about the accuracy of the monthly trade numbers generated by Customs &amp; Excise (C&amp;E).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet economist Mike SchUssler says faulty trade data from C&amp;E are distorting the import component of the Central Statistical Service's producer price inflation (PPI) figures. Among the highlights of this year's trade data botches, says SchUssler, are that South Africa imported eight million buses at 34c each, thousands of television sets at R23 apiece and panties costed at R48 each.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the import component of the PPI should be outstripping the local component, dragging the overall rate of increase in the index up to about 7,6% . The latest figure for the PPI, released last week, showed a rise of 6,6% in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ben van Rensburg, chief economist at the South African Chamber of Business, concurs: &quot;With the 23% depreciation in the rand so far this year, one would have expected import prices to show substantial increases. Instead, the local price rises have driven the PPI more than import prices, which indicates the statistics are faulty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Edey Rogers economic consultant Edward Osborn said that even with the three-month lag in the C&amp;E data, the import component's failure to react made sense if the cuts in import tariffs and the removal of the surcharges had softened the blow of the weaker currency. He warned that when it came round to October -- the anniversary of the abolition of import surcharges -- there could be a massive jump in the import component as the index bore the full brunt of the rand's devaluation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osborn was not that concerned that the CSS was using C&amp;E data. He said that although the figures were often faulty with regard to the quantity of imports, the department's measurement of unit costs appeared reasonably reliable, albeit with a three-month lag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SchUssler was not convinced of the tariffs explanation, arguing the reductions only accounted for 5% of the total picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Rensburg highlighted another problem with the unreliable data: &quot;With the increasing globalisation of world trade, more and more countries are having to rely on anti-dumping measures to ensure fair trade. How can we fight against unfair competition if we don't have the correct statistics?  We're left without any quantifiable basis for complaints.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But inefficiency and corruption aside, a bigger problem at the C&amp;E is the lack of equipment and the appropriate data-collection and dissemination methods, says Van Rensburg. &quot;Rubbish in can only mean rubbish out,&quot; he says. &quot; They need to upgrade their technology. But they need time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in constant contact with the relevant departments in a bid to find a solution. One is a data base designed by a private sector company, believed to do the trick. Until we have the right system, we have no idea of the extent of the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, some Reserve Bank officials are seriously concerned about the unreliable data, although Dr Ernie van der Merwe, chief economist, says one should look at broader three-month statistics for a more accurate picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In any one month something can happen, such as a big oil shipment, which distorts the figures. And while there is a certain margin of error in the C&amp;E statistics, I have no reason to believe the C&amp;E margin of error is greater than any others. All macro-economic figures are liable to some discrepancy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Loud music eased the tension for Jean-Jacques Terblanche before his big race in Atlanta, and it inspired him to win gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paralympic champion Jean-Jacques Terblanche is not an athlete who succumbs to big match nerves. As he sat in the call-up room waiting for his 200m individual medley final at the Georgia Tech Aquatics Centre, where Penny Heyns had spun her magic spell a few weeks earlier, he was the image of relaxed composure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While all around him stared nervously into space or tried to psyche each other out, the youthful Terblanche listened to music with a wide grin on his face, Nine Inch Nails driving through his head -- his choice of music, not the latest technique from the land of the Blue Bulls to get sportsmen revved up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's industrial music, not funny music. The grin was for the antics of one his rivals who was doing his best rendition of Fred Deburghgraeve's giant frog leaps while emitting strange grunting noises. Olympic lOOm breaststroke champion Deburghgraeve might unsettle the opposition with his pre-race ritual but Terblanche merely found this display amusing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although by nature Terblanche is not easily ruffled, he takes his swimming very seriously and had engaged the services of a sports psychologist in his build-up to the Paralympics. &quot;I saw him twice before Malta (1994 world championships) and around 10 times before Atlanta,&quot; says Terblanche. &quot;My mum first suggested I go to see a sports psychologist and I thought if it would help then why not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides visualisation techniques and special exercises to loosen up and stay relaxed he was told to listen to music before the race. &quot;If you are tense you should listen to laid back music to calm you down but I'm so laid back I have to listen to loud, heavy music,&quot; says Terblanche by way of explaining his usual pre-race fare of Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin or Nine Inch Nails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in his first international competition when he won the world title in Malta as a 14-year-old, Terblanche handled himself like a seasoned campaigner twice his age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Malta this guy sat opposite me and started staring at me, but I wasn't worried because my sports psychologist told me that's what they would do. I just stared back at him and it wasn't 30 seconds before he got up and walked away. He's never tried that again because he knows it doesn't work on me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps after the incredible success of the Paralympic team in Atlanta -- 28 medals from 41 athletes -- the South African public will take our disabled sportsmen and women a little more seriously. But should anyone still doubt them then the punishing preparation behind Terblanche's triumphs should help to sway them. &quot;Before Malta I was doing between 5 000m and 6 000m a day in the pool but this year I increased that to 8 000m,&quot; he says. In comparison, Penny Heyns does 6 000m in a typical session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terblanche did his daily workouts after school, slogging away for close on three hours. &quot;My school work became quite a problem because often I'd be so tired I'd just fall asleep while doing my homework. The opportunity to compete in the Paralympics doesn't come often though and I decided I must just go for it,&quot; says Terblanche, who will do his matric next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although that tough training regimen carried him to the gold medal and two world records, it didn't come without its setbacks. In the early part of this year he got breaststrokers knee and couldn't kick properly in training, and then two months before the Games he injured his shoulder and had to stop training for five months and have cortisone injections. &quot;It was so painful at one stage that I couldn't even bring my arm over my head to pull a single stroke,&quot; he recalls with a grimace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those injuries may have cost Terblanche vital training time at a crucial stage in his programme, but they still could not keep him from achieving his goal. Just as he had in Malta where he set his first world record, Terblanche came from behind on the backstroke leg, the second of the four disciplines in the medley, and hauled Germany's Holger Kimmig in on his favourite breaststroke leg before setting up a thrilling finish in the freestyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmig is faster than the South Atrican in the freestyle and as he turned just a fraction of a second down on Terblanche he must have sensed victory.  Terblanche had paced himself to perfection though and pulled steadily clear to win by more than three seconds, eclipsing his world record trom the heats of 2:42.36 to set a new mark of 2:40.83.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the heats I felt as though I was stuck in the water and I was really struggling so I was surprised when I broke the world record. In the evening everything was perfect though and I really enjoyed it. My stroke was just right and to break the world record and know that you have done your best is an incredible feeling,&quot; says Terblanche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the efforts and achievements of Terblanche and his fellow Paralympians are certainly the equal of any of South Africa's sports stars, they still receive scant recognition and are often treated as either super heroes for overcoming such circumstances or special cases deserving of sympathy. The truth is that disabled sportsmen, and people with disabilities in general, just want to be treated like everyone else and given the same recognition as their able bodied counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terblanche, who lost the use of his lett arm after a car accident when he was two which injured his neck, is fortunate that he has been exposed to less discrimination than most disabled people. &quot;I'm lucky because if I put my hand in my pocket you can't really see that I'm disabled. I don't need much help from anyone but if you are in a wheelchair it's a totally different situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people just don't know how to behave around people with disabilities and although they mean well it can be frustrating when they try to help. I would rather ask for help than have somebody offer it to me,&quot; says Terblanche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His swimming career started when he was seven and he entered a school inter- house gala and came second in the 50m breaststroke. &quot;I'm still so proud of that silver medal,&quot; he says. A short while later he started training with his friend's swimming coach, Linda de Jager, and he has been with her ever since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I must say she has been a very supportive coach. She never made me feel different from all the others, which is the way I preter it. I think that's the best thing she could have done for me because I was just like all the other little kids.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In standard one he was actually the top-ranked 50m breaststroker in Northern Transvaal and it was only when he was 12 that he discovered there was competition for the disabled. &quot;I entered five events at the national championships in Stellenbosch, competing in the under-14 age group, and I broke four South African records,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the beginning of a career whose rise has been meteoric and which should go on for many years to come. &quot;I'm still young so to stop now would be crazy. My times can only get faster and I'm going to carry on competing at the world championships and Paralympics,&quot; says the young man from Afrikaans High School in Pretoria who wants to go to hotel school in Geneva after matriculating and spending a year working and travelling in England.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is perhaps something to be thankful for that the rugby season has swung back into the business of Currie Cup and the rude awakening of the test arena is, for a while at least, behind us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will, until the tours of Argentina and France and the single international against Wales shortly before Christmas, save us from some of the muddled thinking and sincerely spoken inanities that have characterised the game at national level of late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief of these has been the assumption on the part of our national coach and manager, Andre Markgraaff, that he speaks with oracular powers and that what he mouths should be taken as writ. He is on record as saying that the selection of recent Springbok sides has been aimed at building the nucleus for the team which is to defend the World Cup in Wales in three years' time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markgraaff is also on record as saying: &quot;My approach to selections is conservative. There will be time to blood the young players against Argentina.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has some defence for the second statement. It is a logical approach to the process of change that is inherent in the ethos of sport where the young timelessly chase out the old and the heartbeat of the game hardly falters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But surely, the first recorded assumption is built on a premise -- admittedly one made shaky by the long list of injuries -- that winning the World Cup was the terminus rather than the start of the journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has to be pointed out that a 10cm stretch of the fingers by Abdul Benazzi in the rain-sodden semi-final against France in Durban, or the marginal miscalculation that swayed the Andrew Mehrtens's drop goal attempt past the posts in the tumultuous final against New Zealand at Ellis Park, added up to the difference between triumph and tears. They are margins too small for the arrogance of assuming that the All Blacks are not the best side in the world. Or, one might add, the basis for experimentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite simply, you cannot pick anything but the strongest side against teams like the All Blacks and Wallabies. To suggest that this is the time for experimentation is to stretch credibility beyond the imagination of even a Hollywood sci-fi producer. It is, in short, arrant nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, one suspects, is Markgraaff's assumption that Springbok backline play has declined dramatically in the last five years, as he so emphatically claims. True, we do not have another Danie Gerber right now, but there are players such as Jeremy Thomson and Dick Muir. And, it must be said, a James Small left to watch test matches from the stands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One would suspect that the decision by the South African Rugby Football Union to bolster Markgraaff's management team by bringing in Hugh Reece- Edwards and Carel du Plessis as backline coaches is based as much on underpinning Markgraaff's obfustication of the true state of rugby union as it stands, as it is of dire necessity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reece-Edwards and Du Plessis are both representative of all that can be good about South African rugby behind the pack; inventive and aggressive players of merit and surely to prove assets to the game at top level in the run-up to Cardiff 1999. Their joint appointment is to be applauded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So too is that of Boland coach Nick Mallett to work with the forwards. A bruisingly physical eighthman in his own playing days, he has the added advantage of having been steeped in the French game as a top player in the Gallic league. It is a mix which can only aid a national side which has sometimes lacked not just the answers, but the questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to the business currently on hand, the Currie Cup, where Markgraaff and his three new assistants must focus their attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three can do worse than concentrate on what one of Markgraaff's predecessors, Ian MacIntosh, is doing with the Natal side. Here is a team that scrums with passion, runs with commitment and flair, a unit of very diverse entities that takes the knocks and yet still manages to play the game as if they are truly enjoying it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also somewhat surprising, given the problems which have beset the national selectors, that Cabous van der Westhuizen has not been given the opportunity to at least sit on the bench for a test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His three-try haul in Natal's second half devastation of Eastern Province was central to the 53-9 victory, gave the hirsute winger a share of the provincial try-scoring record at 80 crossings of opposition lines and reconfirmed the King's Park crew as favourites for the Currie Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same adventurous approach is true of Free State and, while one would hesitate to applaud the sometimes pugilistic approach among the forwards which led to Jaco Coetzee playing less than the scheduled 80 minutes in last weekend's 25-16 win over Western Province, it is a tragedy that the boys from Bloemfontein did not qualify for the Super 12 last time round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Transvaal continue to do what they have always done best; grind away up front and then let the backs go. The lessons the late Brigadier Buurman van Zyl ingrained into the provincial psyche have not been forgotten.  It is an even money bet -- and a good one -- that Northerns will be in the final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Transvaal, admittedly hampered by injuries in key positions, the less said right now the better. This is a combination in disarray as the frantic scrabble to edge out the coalminers from South Eastern Transvaal so clearly showed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is too much talent for this state of affairs to persist and the team will be back, though one suspects that this season is too far gone for any miracles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the provincial competition is the arena for identifying the seeds of the squad for Wales. For, with the depth of numbers and the fierceness of the challenge for the cup, it would seem impossible that this country cannot always pick a side to take on the world. The competition cannot be that brittle. The evidence of South Eastern Transvaal would show eloquently that this is not so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, hopefully, our national brains trust will use the evidence on display and the talent at hand without stirring more mud into the already troubled waters with yet more excuses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Having already established their reputation on South African rugby and cricket fields over the years, Australia will make their soccer debut in the Simba Four Nations Cup, which kicks off at Kings Park in Durban on Saturday, and has a $50 000 first prize. The other nations participating in the week-long event are Kenya and Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there is little doubt that the needle and pride that prevails in the circles of the oval and little red ball, will continue on the soccer fields of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was clearly indicated by coach Eddie Thompson on the team's arrival this week. &quot;There will be no love lost on the field, we like knocking people around a bit, so do the South Africans,&quot; he said. &quot;We are serious about this tournament, this will be no holiday camp.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the last time the two countries met -- during a short tour South Africa undertook &quot;Down Under&quot; -- the Aussies ran out winners beating Bafana Bafana 1-0 on both occasions. These defeats were the first blotches in the copybook of national coach Clive Barker, something he will undoubtedly want to rectify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Aussies, though likely to be without most of their European-based players, are bound to provide the sternest challenge to the hosts in their third defence of the prestigious trophy. In 1994 South Africa shared the trophy with Cote d'Ivoire, and last year they won it outright, easily shrugging off the challenges of Zambia, Egypt and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most importantly, the hosts have not lost a game in the two past Four Nations tournaments, six games in total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the much-awaited meeting between South Africa and Australia only takes place next Wednesday. This Saturday Bafana Bafana take on Kenya, while the Socceroos meet Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to popular belief, the youthful Kenyans, recent shock conquerors of Nations Cup quarterfinalists Algeria in a World Cup eliminator, could well provide stern opposition to Barker's Bafana Bafana, who will be dedicating the game to the memory of late Kaizer Chiefs and Moroka Swallows stalwart, Eliakim &quot;Pro&quot; Khumalo. His son Doctor, also one of South African soccer's greats, is expected to be in Saturday's squad. The Kenyan side is expected to contain a few of the players that, despite losing 3-2, gave South Africa's national Under-23 side a lesson in football a few months ago in a friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those who played at Milpark were goalkeeper Matthews Ottomax and defenders Tom Juma and Musa Otieno.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, or should I say alarmingly, while the Kenyans have players that graduated from their Under-23 squad, none of the South African players who played in that game have made any inroads as far as playing for the senior national side is concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barker has included five new players in his squad, and they join three other players who have yet to gain caps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uncapped players are Jacob Tshisevhe (28), Dumisa Ngobe (23), Bradley Muir (27), Lovers Mohlala (20), Edries Burton (27), Isaac Kungoane (25), Quinton Fortune (18) and Jerry Sikosana (28).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food for thought indeed, especially if you look at the ages of the players on the verge of national selection, and then look at countries in the rest of Africa, with only a fraction of the financial input, and see the type of players they produce, and their ages when they break into the national squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see how many uncapped players Clive Barker will use in the tournament, which should be used as an experiment in preparation for France '98, no matter the result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last season the tournament served as a route to success for quite a few players. With his two goals against Zambia, Mark Williams firmly established himself in a tournament that was make or break for him, after a period not long beforehand when he just failed to impress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also Andre Arendse's debut in that game against Zambia, and the Cape Town custodian has not looked back since. Neither did forward Shaun Bartlett, who along with Arendse had just clinched the double with their club, Cape Town Spurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartlett cemented his place in the Nations Cup squad, and then went on to secure a lucrative contract in the Major Soccer League (MSL) in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in with the new came the old, and one player making a comeback to the squad for the tournament, is former Kaizer Chiefs star Fani Madida, now based in Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year Madida attacked Barker in the media, questioning his non- selection, and now has basically forced himself back into the squad, with it seems, a gun to Barker's head who has given in to pressure from the public and certain (influential) sections of the media. Recently Barker remarked that nobody will choose his squad for him. This time it seems, Mr Madida chose himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tournament kicks off on Saturday in Durban with Ghana taking on Australia at 3pm followed by South Africa against Kenya at 5pm. On Wednesday (September 18) the action moves to the Johannesburg Stadium where Ghana meet Kenya at 6pm and South Africa have their crunch encounter with Australia at 8pm. The final matches are at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria on Saturday (September 21) with Australia v Kenya at 7pm and South Africa v Ghana at 9pm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Bankers and broadcasters were this week introduced to a little Xhosa mythology by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, at the multiple launch in Johannesburg of 40 new books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was not reading from one of the stories just published, but was using the example of the terrible Impundulo bird to explain the destructiveness of ignorance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy president said that the invisible fowl would kick victims in the chest until they vomited blood and eventually died. Controlled by practitioners of &quot;juju&quot;, Impundulo had a particular affection for people who had worked on the mines. For each senseless death by disease, the community wrought a senseless murder, killing the &quot;culprit&quot; or witch.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, said Mbeki, the lack of &quot;adult education can be a matter of life or death&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 40 titles produced by the Easy Reading for Adults (ERA) vernacular initiative, all dealt with life and many with death. And if there was a common thread, it seemed to be the struggle of tradition versus change, interwoven with the plight of the poor and women's rights as they straddle African and Western value systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the new authors wrote about the &quot;juju&quot; to which Mbeki is opposed.  In Petrus Mabena's IsiNdebele story UNomrhaso, he tells of the water spirit and protection given if one wears green wool around the wrists. Fred Bila's Sepedi story Dikeledi also deals with the problem of witchcraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boikemisetso is a poignant story by Wilheminah Kutumela: an illiterate woman avoids helping her sick son rather than admit to the clinic that she cannot fill in a form. But there is a happy ending when she, at last, has the courage to start attending literacy classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Thapelo Selepe's book Lekgoba la Masikutlo, the white boss admits to ill- treating his farm-workers when they challenge his authority. A little too cutely, they all sit down and solve their problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the English summaries make dull reading -- one can only hope the stories are less so. While the value of immunisation is vital and it is equally important to know how to use an autobank machine, there have to be more lively topics for fiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like necklacing in the Northern Province ... but Fred Bila's Tsonga tale Mali ya Mudende recommends the criminals should be handed over to the police rather than burned. Some issues have a very local flavour!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems unlikely that the books are great literary works, but for the first time there are four readers in the four levels of literacy available to every (non-English) official language group in South Africa. More important still, the books are not translations but are original works, often by first- time authors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Mbulelo Mzamane, vice chancellor of the University of Fort Hare, believes that this recognition of South Africa's language policy is a vital step. With more passion than Pavarotti, the outstretched arms and oratory of a preacher, he called on the country to launch a five-year campaign to renew a culture of learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To an audience of like-minded people the words were powerful. The explanation for poor productivity, he said, came down to the educational deprivation of decades; a calculated deprivation that deserved its own hearing at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other linguists urged that more recognition be given to the cultural and social value of language; to the expressions that record history even as it is made. And they urged, at a time of declining sales, the print media should put some more energy into attracting the readers it will need in the years to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While big publishers Heinemann, Kagiso, Via Afrika with Viva and Juta were involved in the 40-book project, the sad truth is that most would never have touched languages like Tshivenda of Xitsonga without the assistance of a hearty subsidy through the Kagiso Trust. But now that the books exist, they may just be the catalyst needed to generate more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ERA's Beulah Thumbadoo is proud that the previous dearth of mother-tongue material for adults has been tackled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have stimulated new writing rather than the easier option of translating proven material. But we nonetheless had grave doubts over the language authenticity in some titles.&quot; She insists that ERA &quot;will not sacrifice quality to timeframes and squander funding on poor publications. We have launched the bulk of the books now, but some can still be improved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The printing presses are already turning, churning out the 120 000 copies of the new books. And ERA and associated organisations will go on fighting and righting the wrong in a society in which millions of people still cannot read.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - DEUR DIE OOG VAN 'n NAALD by Mathews Phosa (Tafelberg, R49, 95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the publishers, this just-released book of poems is a runaway success: the Leserskring has made such heavy demands that they are having difficulty filling orders! Why, one wonders, is this? Is it the curiosity factor -- for it is somewhat curious to have a leader of the African National Congress the premier of Mpumalanga no less, writing poetry in Afrikaans. Are the ladies of the Leserskring that eager for reconciliation? Or is this simply an excellent collection and not to be missed by any serious reader and collector in South Africa today?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deur Die Oog van 'n Naald consists of 24 poems prefaced by four brief essays, forming a coherent whole in that both the prose and the poetry provide an unpretentious and thought-provoking self-portrait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Die Prys van Vryheid is the only piece which is structurally loose; first Mathews Phosa details his political position and the personal sacrifice that entailed, then jumps to the success of the South African miracle, why he writes in Afrikaans and how he intends to raise his children. But it ends with a sock in the guts in the form of some comment on &quot;ja-gewoontes&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken in conjunction with his poem 'n Ja-baas, it is clear that Phosa has kept his critical faculties in good nick. In 'n Ja-baas, he satirises one of the waBenzi, a homeland leader grown fat on co-operation, saying &quot;ja&quot; to his apartheid masters. But in Die Prys van Vryheid, he writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ons ry nou ook in lang slap amptelike motors. Ons word ook onderdanig ge- je-baas, ja-meneer, ja-minister, ja-alles. Die nee-mense van die struggle het vinnig en onverklaarbaar ja-gweoontes aangeleer.&quot; This, of course, has very serious implications for our future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also now ride in long limp official motorcars. We are also humbly yes- mastered, yes-sir, yes-minister, yes-everything. The no-people of the struggle have swiftly and unaccountably learned yes-habits&quot; -- translated for the benefit of those sluggards who have not yet learned even two official languages. Phosa speaks nine and makes a plea, in his essay Taal As Versoeningsinstrument, for all South Africans to become at least trilingual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most interesting of his essays is Afrikaans As Landstaal -- 'n Digter Se Siening. He is not the first to compare the struggle of the Afrikaners to liberate themselves from the British with the more recent freedom struggle in South Africa, but he is probably the first black poet to use Afrikaans poetry to console himself and draw strength, quoting the greats: NP van Wyk Louw, Totius, Antjie Krog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phosa points out that Afrikaans liberated the nation in that it provoked the resistance of 1976, and goes on to celebrate the fact that now Afrikaans is free, as free as Tswana, Xhosa and the rest. It is not only Afrikaners who can respond to the old poets who wrote about freedom and the beauty of the land in Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far so good, and none of this is startlingly new, though it does us no harm to hear it again. But what of the poems? Are they any good? Can just anyone write poetry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, Phosa is not just anyone and this is demonstrated by his poetry more than anything else. &gt;From 24 years he has gleaned 24 poems, a modest offering.  In the same way, the poems themselves are accessible and unpretentious, with an appearance of simplicity. Some are very short; for example, Ek Sal Iets Doen is only eight lines long, but perfectly encapsulates the will to resist which must have fired much of his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The simplicity is deceptive, as there is in all of the poems a core of strength, both emotional and intellectual, that special poet's attribute of being able to show us an entirely new angle on something we've always known.  The earlier poems are clearly resistance poems, struggle poems -- neat, powerful and highly original. They are also more formal in tone, written in rather correct Afrikaans, with due respect for form and rhythm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The title poem shows a freer form and a more all-embracing language. This lovely poem reflects our exact pre-election anxieties, and then celebrates the miracle of the election with a wonderful irony, ending with the perfect joyful summation: &quot;dit was so hittete!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final poem in the book sees a return to form, the form in fact of a prayer or hymn. It is called Nou Bid Ek, and in it Phosa addresses his own racism, needing divine assistance to rid himself of it. Despite its religious tone, it delivers a little &quot;regmaker&quot; to the reader, a little ACK (attitude correction klap). He writes: &quot;Al wat ek afstaan, is krummels/ wat hulle moet opraap om te oorleef&quot; (&quot;All that I leave is crumbs/ which they must scrape up to survive&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its honesty and sincerity are nicely belied for the white reader by its irony, since times have changed -- and who are now the beggars at the gate?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Department of Psychology at Wits University and Unisa recently co-hosted an intriguing two day event at the atmospheric old Wits Medical School building in Hillbrow, Johannesburg. Dubbed The Body Politic, it is the second annual gathering of young academics and workers in the human sciences which goes some way towards radically altering the notion of what constitutes legitimate objects of critical, intellectual, even scientific interest in the crusty old academy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that infoculture is rapidly becoming bodiless, that our technology is leading us into a post-corporeal world order which is surely and hopefully the last post, has become almost commonplace. Another quite different millennial obsession has arisen alongside the interest in disembodied forms of interaction such as the Internet. This could be characterised as an obsession with the difference of the body and it's heavily influenced by the work of French philosopher Michel Foucault on knowledge, power and sexuality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This renewed interest in the body has been fuelled by two modern social currents -- the growing legitimacy of gay and lesbian claims on identity as well as experimentation with other forms of sexuality and sexual experience (such as S/M). South African responses to the millennial questions of the body in society have taken rather unique turns, as the Body Politic conference showed, whatever the origins of this renewal of attention on the possibilities of our corporeality. The nature of the gathering though, might make it more accurate to refer to it as an event, rather than a conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more conventional academic input brought together papers from academics as far afield as Scotland and California, many of them focused on issues of sexual and racial identity. Alex Butchart from Unisa's Health Psychology Unit synthesised many of the participants' intellectual concerns and theoretical methods in his plenary address. Butchart focused on the tendency of the human sciences to employ power as a means of producing their objects of inquiry. He used the pertinent South African example of medical science &quot;fabricating&quot; an object called &quot;the African Body&quot; -- which draws a network of power and knowledge relations around it. Other papers discussed such disparate and surprising fields as rave culture, androgyny and the behaviour of people in elevators! Far from trivialising the important social and political questions surrounding the millennial body, these novel approaches and areas of inquiry opened up debate and ideas around what qualified as a legitimate object of academic study. Questions of sexuality, however, constantly ran through the academic aspects of the event. While the academics debated issues of child abuse, homosexuality and research method, something rather more subversive was going on at a tangent to the ivory tower talkshops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major current of the event swirled around the issue of transgression: if the body is millennial, apocalyptic even, what qualifies as taboo behaviour, as deviant thinking? This issue implies the obvious social and political response to the flouting of taboos -- censorship. It's a response familiar to the art community with the notorious debate around the vagina-shaped ceramic ashtray. This debate was revisited at Body Politic, yet with a neat twist, a discussion group was led by young artist Kaolin Thompson herself. Perhaps more significant than the well-worn terms of the debate, even though a parliamentary intervention still seems excessive, was the fact that this was the only occasion at which the young, white, female art student was given a public forum to respond. Understandably, she seemed hurt, baffled and perhaps excited that it was so easy to wind people up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Censorship and taboo were also issues for the exhibitors, artists and booksellers occupying the central space at the medical school venue.  Dominated by a giant banner made by controversial artist Steven Cohen reading &quot;Give us your children -- what we can't fuck we eat&quot; the space also featured a Cohen installation, the preserved head of a human foetus on a dinner plate; literature on the body and perversity from the guru of South Africa's counter- cultural bookdealers, Paul Wessels of Deep South Distribution and a table of very earnest paedophilic literature. The tenor of this space tied very neatly in with Kevin Bishop's academic presentation on &quot;inter-generational sex versus child abuse&quot;. Child abuse being the criminalising of acts of intergenerational sex, the latter being accepted more readily without being criminalised in countries like Holland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of paedophilia seemed to sum up both the potential and the limitations of the Body Politic event: it was limited by the academic framework, where the shock value and transgression of work like Cohen's was contained in a calm intellectual milieu; but also had great potential because extreme experiences like a serious sexual interest in children could find a platform for serious expression and an approach which didn't immediately consign it to the realm of the sick and perverted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the centrepiece of the event expressed exactly this paradox. Vasili Kapetanakis aroused, if that's the right word, the most attention when he arrived in &quot;genderfuck drag&quot; (which turned out to be a wedding ,dress) to have his penis publicly pierced. The author of the operation was Eddie, a diffident, pony-tailed 50-something, whose hands trembled alarmingly as he told the assembly in hushed tones that body-piercing was on the up and up in South Africa. Vasili, on a pre-recorded tape, narrated a sequence of slides showing his strict Greek upbringing and eventual coming-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a touching explanation of what supposedly led him to this strange public ritual in, ironically, a medical lecture-hall. The lights dimmed and a spotlight focused on Vasili's groin. He delicately lifted the hem of his dress to reveal his genitals, already somewhat modified by a large and shiny scrotal clamp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incongruously, the hem of the dress went into his mouth as Eddie approached with the piercing needle. The hushed crowd craned necks and flashbulbs popped as the needle went through the urethra and the ventral surface of the glans penis. An eerie single trickle of blood, absurdly bright, trickled down the shaft and across the scrotal clamp. The ring, a Prince Albert piercing, was through. The event over. Warm applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the piercing as a modification ritual, with all the solemnity of a secular ceremony, its immediate impact lay in making the private public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, no one was shocked enough to walk out. What difference it made to Vasili we could not tell, nor could he really tell us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Opening night of Return To The Forbidden Planet at the Victory Theatre was a riot. Amid tables sagging under schnapps and snacks, the audience, before the show, mingled with crew members of the space ship that was to take them on a lavish rock-and-roll space adventure. Two hours later they left with stars in their eyes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The script's liberal adaptation of Shakespeare's Tempest into a whirl-pool of camp one-liners and verbal histrionics is a thinly veiled framework for a musical driven along by a fantastic selection of golden-oldie rock numbers -- and the production holds nothing back. Gathering together an array of artistic talent, the production is an exuberant onslaught of unashamed sci-fi humour and riotous music that had the audience screaming for more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headed by David Dennis, Ian van Memerty, Charl-Johan Lingenfelder and Heidi Edeling, the cast, under Fred Abrahamse's never-flagging direction, revel in their technicolour performances, often engaging the audience with a jibe here and an ad lib there. David Dennis, as the twisted Dr Head, at odds with his family and himself, is brilliant. A herculean performance sees him writhe across the stage with operatic magnificence and a perfectly judged technique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Ian von Memerty gives a slick performance worthy of his five Vita awards. As Captain Tempest he is excellent, and his rendition of the classic hit Young Girl is superb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heidi Edeling, playing Dr Head's wife and ship's scientist, seemed to step straight out of a Gary Larson cartoon. She has the voice of an angel and the comic timing to match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James MacNamara's Gothic, Orwell-ian set provides a magnificent backdrop for the artists to stretch their characters to their over-the-top limits, where others like David Lee, Jann Robertson and Scott Miller turned the audience into putty in their hands, giving exciting, larger-than-life performances. Lee's Robot Ariel was an endearing creature with heart and saxophonic soul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Victory Theatre is once again open, wide-awake and buzzing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Return to the Forbidden Planet is on at the Victory Theatre until the end of 1996 year</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Independent theatre producer and entrepreneur Colin Law is a person who generates controversy. According to members of the theatre fraternity, he is a strange dichotomy of theatrical acumen and sporadic administrative ineptitude, traits which have gained him as many friends as enemies over the past 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's had a finger in just about every theatrical pie in South Africa, spanning the range from corporate launches to serious theatre. In 1994 he blew audiences away with the blockbuster Rocky Horror Picture Show. This week he returned as a salaried member of a consortium which has finally revived the dormant Victory Theatre with a vibrant production of the West End musical, Return To The Forbidden Planet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in South Africa's relatively small and incestuous theatrical fraternity, not everyone is happy that Colin Law is back. In fact, his critics accuse him of &quot;dubious industrial relations&quot;, alleging non-payment of artists as his most serious transgression. Those who support him cite his generosity as his best trait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone has an opinion. A case in point is a 1994 production of Romeo and Juliet, which was to have been performed at the Victory Theatre, but which bombed before it reached the final dress-rehearsal stage, leaving actors stranded without work and many unpaid for part of the four-week rehearsal period. At the time, Law cited pre-election violence as the reason for the collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actor and director Megan Wilson finds this unacceptable. &quot;In a volatile freelance arena where work is hard to come by, and money even more so, what Colin does is unforgivable. And I blame not only the artists who continue to work for him, but also the agents who encourage them. It's astounding that he can still greet one in the supermarket as though nothing had happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musical actor Ian von Memerty, currently starring in Return To The Forbidden Planet, disagrees. &quot;Colin always goes for the right material: he knows what the public wants and how to give it to them. He has had problems in the past, but if he did err, it was on the side of generosity. He's a theatrical person who pays good salaries. It boils down to whether you can work with him, and whether you trust him. I can, and I do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What both critics and supporters agree on is that Law has the wit to spot a marketable concept, the instinct to cast it and the drive to close the deal.  His successes in the past indicate that he's a powerful force in local theatre, someone in a cautious industry who's prepared to take the risk in order to entertain. But risks, as we know, don't always pay off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is something theatrical agent Lorraine Jaffet believes she learnt the hard way. &quot;Late payment and non-payment of artists. In the past it came to a point where we had to demand cash up-front.&quot; Less diplomatic than some of the other agents,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaffet shoots straight from the hip. &quot;He represents a threat to the integrity of the industry. It spills over into other areas which makes our jobs difficult in terms of sponsorship, and other infrastructural necessities.  I won't let my artists work for him.&quot; She ends on a softer note. &quot;He's a Walter Mitty, but I think he means well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moonyeen Lee, long-time theatrical agent, has a streetwise approach. &quot;He is the most generous theatrical producer in this country, certainly in terms of salary. He has an extremely good sense of what production to launch, and he genuinely cares about his artists. I have been angry with him at times in the past, but it's not as though he uses money to buy himself a Porsche and then disappears. On the contrary, he ploughs it right back into theatre, which is good for the industry and needs to be encouraged.&quot; She says that instances in the past have been &quot;unfortunate&quot; and due mainly to a lack of administration. &quot; If he has a fault, it is that he becomes too excited about a project and may tend to forget about other details.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are details that have prompted actors' union PAWE to place Law on their Special Attention List, a term borrowed from the British Actors' Equity Union, and which spokesman Dan Robbertse says refers to people with a record of &quot;dubious industrial relations&quot;. According to Robbertse, &quot;Law is persona non grata as far as we're concerned. If you work for him, you're on your own, and you have no access to PAWE's in-house legal facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an only semi-unionised industry, where consensus and unity in dealing with some producers is, at best, a blurred arena, some agents and many artists feel that working for Law amounts to scab-labour, providing a pool of talent for the perpetuation of what they see as exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What cannot be denied is that Colin Law has no equal when it comes to high salaries, and his actors are appreciative. Gone are the days when artists lived off applause and a few pennies from the door. Increasingly, they've come to demand that their craft be seen as a professional occupation deserving professional salaries and not mere artistic remuneration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern for the protection of artists permeates the industry, but is sometimes difficult to put into practice, and for an aggrieved artist a contract with a producer is not always a cut-and-dried affair. Legal resources are not easy to access as a freelance individual, and agents do not have the surplus financial muscle to fight a legal battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the Colin Law debate is symptomatic of a larger malaise in the theatre industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risk of failure, the uncertainty of audience attendances, the sometimes fickle and sporadic corporate sponsorship and a government with other problems on its mind all make for an industry often seen battling to keep its practitioners employed and its seats filled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The poet sits mute in a chair while the secret policeman berates him for writing poems which incite &quot;raised fists at memorial services in Regina Mundi&quot;. Not surprising, you might think, in a play staged as a tribute to the late Steven Bantu Biko, murdered 19 years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only halfway through the first poem in Maishe Maponya's forty-minute one- hander, Monuments -- I Read What I Like, it hits you that this secret policeman is a functionary belonging not to yesterday's state, but to the day after tomorrow's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show recycles poetry from Monuments/Bambaata, allows Matsemela Manaka to play a nifty djembe, and entangles Maponya in several onstage quick- changes into assorted African robes. Carfax is a lousy space for the spoken word, with acoustics like an aircraft hangar and this is not necessarily a promising formula. But the result is brilliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all those robes, the production is as close to pure sound as you'll get. It's the words, and the speaking of the words which transfix the listener, while the drum provides pace and tension. Maponya has crafted his words finely, and speaks them movingly. A very tight format eliminates the histrionic repetitions which often sink political plays. So the ideas come like bullets. Writers (if they're any good) have a responsibility to the truth. States (inescapably) are instruments of repression. &quot;What colour will the sky be when the clouds clear? -- an apt question to throw into the candyfloss cosiness of Rainbowland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monuments is just the kind of experimental production for which an arts festival ought to be creating space. Not part of the Arts Alive programme, it closed on Thursday night.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - So what's a &quot;jazz poet&quot;? Some bearded dude in shades spewing Kerouac sentiments in a cellar while a cool vibraphone tinkles? Some other bearded, shaded-and-dashiki-wearing dude declaiming angrily in a loft while a hot saxophone wails? Jane Cortez is neither of these.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a start, she's definitely not a dude. She's a tiny lady making the hotel armchair she's curled into look distinctly overstuffed. Firmly, she asserts the role of women as writers: &quot;A poet ... is a poet and in that sense you can't compartmentalise women's writing. But a lot of women are finding their own voices today and their work plays a serious role in cancelling out the silences that have existed in literature about our lives.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those jazz-poet ghosts of the Fifties and Sixties wouldn't have said that.  But Arizona-born Cortez, in Johannesburg with her band The Firespitters for the poetry component of Arts Alive, is very firmly grounded in the Nineties, poetically and musically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cortez started working with music way back, taking the politics and passion of her involvement in the US civil rights movement into performance spaces across the country. &quot;I grew up in a household full of music -- jazz and the blues -- so it felt very natural to put words and music together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's worked with musicians whose outlook is predominantly modernist, including Horace Tapscott and Arthur Blythe. Her current band comprises drummer Denardo Coleman, guitarist Bem Nix, bassist Al MacDowell and reedman Talib Kibwe. Cortez's political involvement has extended to years of work with the US anti-apartheid movement, although this is her first visit to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her modernism extends to the way words and music are fitted together.  Whereas many performance poets use music to accompany their words -- filling in spaces, providing illustrations -- Cortez and her band strive to create a seamless synergistic whole, with interaction of both sound and image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It works on many levels,&quot; says Coleman. &quot;Jayne is like another musician&quot;.  There's much nodding of band heads, and the players constantly emphasise how much the collaboration with Cortez is, in Kibwe's words, &quot;more like working with a singer; we all feed off the interplay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Coleman: &quot;What's she's saying creates another element in our interpretation. We listen to the words, and they inspire images in our playing. While there's a fairly light structure of tempo and key; there's spontaneity in how we vary the timing to help her express the meaning of the words&quot;. Nix adds: &quot;And then there's her inflection, the pulse and rhythm of her speech. We're reacting spontaneously on all those levels while we play.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same way, Cortez, improvises. &quot;Just as the musicians play from the chords which give them a base to move around, so I may decide during a performance that I'm going to play with certain words or take off in a new direction from certain images. It often depends on the atmosphere of a live show, on what you give to and take from the audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jazz is Cortez's music of choice precisely because it allows such flexibility. She's reluctant to provide a hard definition of genre: &quot;Jazz is life. It holds all of my history from the traditional beat of the djembe right on to the future of electronic technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And she's uneasy about the tight jazz academicism which is beginning to dominate at important American venues like the Lincoln Centre. &quot;I think certain kinds of musical packaging have to do with selling the music, rather than with its spirit. And I think its limiting to define jazz too narrowly.  Some of what I'm hearing needs to loosen up, to practise more democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those interactions between politics and music, ideas and music, words and music, are the recurring motifs of Cortez's work. On Friday and Saturday at Carfax, she'll share the stage with South African poets and deliver a dozen poems with the band. Their sound, as sampled on the album Everywhere Drums, is strong and powerful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We allude,&quot; says Nix, &quot;to everything that's happened with the jazz tradition -- and a few other things besides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacDowell adds that the band's strongest focus is &quot;probably on the blues&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps, Cortez herself puts it best in the song Adupe, laying down the ghosts of more effete poets-with-music with the assertion that the Firespitters' sound is &quot;not tweet-tweet but mau-mau&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The International Film Festival which opens this week is the baby of Len Davis, the man who started the Johannesburg Film Festival back in 1977. It played at the beautiful Monte Carlo cinema in Jeppe Street (now a clothes shop) and the Lake cinema in Parkview (now a supermarket).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television had just come to South Africa, but, unless you felt like watching Hitchcock's Rebecca for the umpteenth time, the movies it showed were always bad. Videos were boring unless you knew a store that pirated overseas TV and the 1990s art house phenomenon was still a long time coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In those days there was no Rosebank Mall, no Constantia cinema ... so the festivals were a great success,&quot; says Davis. He recalls the release of Peter Weir's breakthrough Australian art movie Picnic at Hanging Rock, for which he owned the SA rights: &quot;I released it through Ster-Kinekor at what was then the Kine Centre, when Commissioner Street was the Sandton City of today ... It played for four months and Ster-Kinekor were terribly surprised.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis hails from West Hampstead in London. Ruffled and polite to the point of brusqueness, like an unstrung and over-worked agent, he buzzes around nervously behind his trademark specs -- obviously the result of decades of staring at the silver screen. In the Sixties he dabbled in film-making as a production assistant on the cult movie Wild in the Streets (in which a dope- smoking hippie runs for president) and collaborated with David Sherwin, writer of If ... , on a screenplay. In 1976 he came to South Africa and one year later, under the auspices of the Jewish Board of Deputies, began the Johannesburg Film Festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those were the days, and the festival ran successfully into the mid- Eighties. Then everything started bursting at the seams. Local film festival programming changed, notably with the fledgling Weekly Mail Film Festival and the Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg festivals presenting an alternative to the usual Euro-house compilation. The new festivals extended their programming to disadvantaged areas, with development and outreach programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They invited renowned film-makers from around the globe to share their ideas and hold workshops. Over the years the Weekly Mail Festival hosted Paul Schrader, Mira Nair and Clair Denis, while Cape Town invited the likes of Nicholas Roeg and Werner Herzog. In addition, they made strong efforts to screen local films, getting special permission for one-off showings of banned movies. They also included a healthy selection of short and experimental films. These festivals presented themselves as more than just shopping for imported spectacles, they were imaginatively and interactively programmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But things change: administrative and funding problems have brought The Mail &amp; Guardian Festival to a grinding halt; James Polley of Cape Town's festival is said to have put his house on the market to keep things going; the resourceful Ros Sarkin, Durban's programmer, has decided to retire from the festival business. What's happening now is that overseas cultural commissions are either holding their own festivals, or corporate sponsorship is enabling people like Davis to carry on. Even the Cannes retrospective is tied into a promotional campaign for a corporate distillery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the booming development of the art-house market through the early Nineties and business terms like &quot;the market rationalisation of audience demographics&quot; and &quot;movie-mall-isation&quot;, the major players have firmly positioned themselves to catch the viewers of alternative films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis himself owned and operated the Piccadilly and the Seven Arts in Johannesburg for a number of years in the halcyon days. He ruefully comments on the demise of the independents: &quot;You can't operate on a single screen anymore. You've got to have 10 screens, and then another 10 somewhere else -- a balanced circuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sign of the times, perhaps, is that in May, Davis took out a free option on Italo Bernicchi's Seven Arts cinema in Norwood to screen the International Festival. Bernicchi, one of the last independent exhibitors in Gauteng, made plans to spruce the place up and the owner of the building even met Davis to discuss plans for a coffee-shop. But only a month ago, Davis placed a letter under Bernicchi's door saying he would no longer use the cinema's services as he needed a facility with two screens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernicchi not only lost the Festival but several other bookings for parties and conferences -- his bread and butter -- which he was forced to cancel to make room for the festival. &quot;All in all,&quot; he says, &quot;I've lost about R36 000.  Davis himself owned the cinema for eight years, if it was good enough for him then. Why not now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernicchi is a grand pioneer of independent cinema, having spearheaded the Victory Cinema for years. &quot;In those days I'd say to my partner, 'We've only got 150 people in tonight so we'd better change the movie on Friday. Nowadays if we get 50 I say we're doing well.&quot; He's hanging in there as a labour of love. His voice rasps emotionally as he berates movie-mall culture. &quot;These people say they want to see a movie, but they actually go window-shopping.  They're looking at ties and shirts and perfume displays. No one knows about directors or movies, they go there to be seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis is defensive about the incident: &quot;I understand he's very upset, but it wasn't a booking, it was an option.&quot; The reality is probably that the sponsor wanted a more upmarket venue, the kind where people do go to be seen and not just to see movies. It's a sad state of affairs and it seems the days of independent cinemas like Italo's are numbered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Len Davis, on the other hand, has changed with the times but that's because he's primarily a businessman who makes money buying and selling movies. He's been criticised because he is both an independent distributor and a festival programmer. His company, Festival Films, own the rights to the mediocre bomber thriller The Final Cut, currently on circuit, and he recently purchased the new Pamela Anderson picture, Gift Wrapped. Last year his purchase of Luc Besson's The Professional earned R3,5-million as it straddled both the commercial and art markets. And that's how he's managed to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ster-Kinekor, paradoxically, also operates with two arms that shake each other, taking a healthy slice as distributors and exhibitors of the producer's pie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Art-house cinemas now exist in shopping malls, like coffee shops and Mediterranean eateries. It's all about business these days, not the driven passion for movies -- and Nineties business ethics get in the way of imaginative programming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Djibril Diop Mambety's brilliant Hyenas, for example, was distributed by Ster-Moribo, the art-film division didn't even consider playing it at a place like the Rosebank Mall. After all, it's an African film not a French, German or for that matter, Esperanto one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sign of how things have changed is reflected in a recent issue of the US trade mag Variety. An article called Smarties Shun Arties examines the state of foreign film distribution in the US. &quot;Say the words 'French filmmaker' to the average college kid these days and he's likely to think of Jean-Claude Van Damme. Art-house proprietors complain that their audience is greying, especially for foreign films; and distributors of foreign fare gripe that many young reviewers, like their readers, lack historical knowledge of the masters of European cinema.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis agrees, &quot;There are people out there who've never heard of Truffaut.  If you're going to show modern art films you have to give people the chance to know the background. In the old days there was a film society circuit.&quot; But the biggest responsibility to teach and show people the glory days of film and make them cinematically literate, he says, is through television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barry Ronge has expressed a desire to show Fellini's Satyricon and La Dolce Vita on SABC3. But, knowing the corporation, they'll probably be flighted around 11.30 at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we wait, though, you'd be wise to catch some of the films Davis has on show because it may well be your only opportunity to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The festival will be screened at the Mall in Rosebank, Johannesburg and Cavendish Square in Cape Town from September 13 to October 3</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The story about Tebogo Lerole caused a row over composer's recognition and royalties for a Fifties song called Tom Hark. The song was a hit in its time and was also re-arranged and recorded by British jazzman Ted Heath. &quot;It was a standard tune and was played by every big dance band in this country well into the Sixties,&quot; says trombonist Jasper Cook, whose big band career started in 1959.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting Muff Andersson's Music In the Mix, the Mail &amp; Guardian stated that Aaron Lerole, Tebogo's uncle, had written the song. This prompted a call from Tebogo's mother, Thembi, who said her husband, Elias, 58, had written the song, but that producer Rupert Bopape was credited at the South African Music Rights Organisation (Samro).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A call to Samro and to EMI's office confirmed that Rupert Bopape alone is registered as composer. A call to Aaron Lerole got the reply that Elias had written the song and that &quot;Bopape took it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Morake, membership officer of Samro, commented that &quot;there does seem to be a discrepancy over this song&quot;. He recalled meeting with Thembi and Elias over the song in the past, but said no contracts had been changed. &quot;I told them to seek legal advice.&quot; He thought it odd that Bopape was composer on the A-side of the single and Elias's name appeared as composer on the B- side. &quot;Rupert notified the song in about 1980,&quot; he said, &quot;when the song was assigned to a movie. Normally, if there's a dispute over a song, we get the people together in the office to sort it out, but I can't phone the people and say 'Come and fight this battle'&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thembi commented that it wasn't that there were never royalties in those years, in fact she had a copy of a statement for Pounds 60 for other material.  &quot;It's not that royalties were not sent to South Africa from overseas, they were sent to Bopape,&quot; she said. &quot;At least if he won't refund the money he should say he's sorry. It's not only whites who ripped off blacks at that time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Lerole (60) said Elias &quot;woke us up in the middle of the night with a melody running through his head and we worked on it together. But it is his number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, said Aaron: &quot;It doesn't matter any more because someone else took it.  The whole band (Elias and his Zig Zag Jive Flute) fought about it ... To me it brings back heart-breaking memories, thinking it should have paid us enough money as artists. I should be someone now with something to show. But it's a long time ago, 40 years, bygones are bygones and I just want to forget it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two calls to Bopape in Lenyenye, near Tzaneen, proved fruitless. We were told he was now &quot;a very sick man&quot;, with sugar diabetes, hypertension and cardiac problems and was unlikely to respond. But shortly after our first call, he phoned Elias Lerole and &quot;said Elias must come to Tzaneen to talk about the song&quot;, said Thembi. &quot;He asked Elias to give him the song. We battle to educate our kids and my husband has fought for this song, to no good end as yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Elias: &quot;It was composed by me. After I composed it and went and recorded it, it was written on the record that it was Rupert Bopape. Aaron is not a co-composer, it was only me.&quot; Added Thembi: &quot;I doubt if Bopape could play this song if you gave him a pennywhistle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bopape had 64 songs registered with Samro, said Morake. David Coplan's book In Township Tonight (which also claimed Aaron had written the song) credits Bopape with discovering &quot;some outstanding talent&quot; including Simon &quot;Mahlathini&quot; Nkabinde.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After a visit to the censors, Gregg Araki's new shocker only just made it onto our screens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1996 the Publications Control Board, under the Publications Act of 1974, banned a movie from South African screens for the first time in over two years. Distributors Ster-Kinekor received a paragraph from the directorate stating that the film was of &quot;no redeemable merit&quot; and the decision to ban it was based on its excessive use of violence and blasphemy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight months and an appeal to the board later, the film The Doom Generation is being released with two cuts. Both of them relate to blasphemy -- which Director of Publications, Dr A Coetzee, claims is justified -- as it would be under the revised Act and in terms of the new Constitution because the scenes in question are offensive to the religious convictions of a section of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film by punky, low-budget queer movie-maker Gregg Araki is, visually, his most accomplished work to date. Araki has never been short of caustic comment and in The Doom Generation he adds to his usual cynical confection with uniquely beautiful production design and cinematography. It tells of two young lovers, Jordan White (James Duval) and Amy Blue (Rose McGowan), and their run-in with Xavier Red (Jonathan Schaech), a sexy, slightly psychotic drifter who inadvertently decapitates a Quickie-Mart clerk. The trio then go on the run in a heady adventure structured around their sexual encounters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An indication of the film's interests lies in a pin-badge which takes pride of place in their car: it reads &quot;Eat, Fuck, Kill&quot;, and that's about all they do in the movie -- albeit against sumptuous backgrounds and set to a score from The Smiths, Jesus and Mary Chain, This Mortal Coil and Nine Inch Nails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Created for outrage, Queer Cinema researcher and critic Jenni Olson says of it, &quot;This seemed the last word in envelope- pushing at the time of its release, the movie your grandma would rather fellate a crucifix than watch to its outre end.&quot; At press previews in the US, many critics walked out, or seemed unsure of how to deal with the film. Local journalists seemed equally taken aback. But that's probably because most of them, and indeed the Censor Board, are well outside the film's intended audience. In an interview in Bright Lights Film Journal, star Rose Mc Gowan says, &quot;All of Gregg's films are about today's youth. I can't say that I would go see Reality Bites. I don't think I would go see those movies because they're all made by 45-year old men in Hollywood, who are all thinking, 'Oh, they'll get off on this, they'll think it's hip, slick, and cool!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Araki agrees: &quot;There's no cinematic equivalent to the alternative music that's popular now. The Doom Generation is for and about what I call the Lollapalooza Generation -- disenfranchised kids with an attitude who don't normally go to the movies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A single print of the film is being released this Friday at The Mall in Rosebank, Johannesburg before moving to Cape Town and Durban</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Yoruba term &quot;esu ulegba&quot; means trickster. It refers to people who slip through the net of definition, avoid closure of any kind and serve as commentators on the vanities of those who take themselves far too seriously. The trickster is not unlike the wise fool in a Shakespearean tragedy. And also a bit like Okwui Enwezor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York-based Enwezor -- recently crowned artistic director of the 1997 Africus Biennale -- has certainly landed in the gooey thick of things.  Due to the tumultuous changing of the old guard in the cultural kigdom he doesn't really know with whom he'll be working: maybe outgoing director of culture, Christopher Till. Possibly incumbent director of culture, Victor Modise. Come to think of it, he's not even sure whether he'll be working at all, given the resulting froth over the future of Africus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What better way to to take a crash-course in South Africa's cultural politics than to dive head-first into the muck?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even though he's the last person to minimise whatever hazards lie ahead, Enwezor is a bit like a dung beetle coping with a mountain of manure. The beetle metaphor, incidentally, is not inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm like an insect with antennae twitching all over the place,&quot; he says, fingering the air by way of illustration. &quot;Although the challenges are so daunting, it is an exhilarating, refreshing opportunity to be in a situation where the cultural issues are so raw, immediate and alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are the last adjectives I would have used to described an aficionado whose resume reads like a conference on contemporary art discourse, let alone an uitlander intent on usurping the cultural throne from its rightful, homegrown heirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But words like refreshing, lively, engaging -- even naive in an oddly informed sort of way -- aptly encapsulate Enwezor. He lacks the arid intellectualism of many of his peers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, he's an incurable social smoker. For another, he's actually pretty humorous. He describes his curatorial projects as consisting of practical plans and an &quot;extensive wish list&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also illustrates lofty theory by means of vivid, earthy examples. For a Cologne exhibition catalogue, he diarised his experience of airport entries and exits based on the French philosopher Michel Foucault's theories on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't come to prescribe but to exchange, to start from a position of dialogue, access South Africa's fractured landscape and, hopefully, scramble the hierarchies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's not suggesting conceptual superglue for the purposes of mediation or mending, merely a series of public panel discussion where old issues will be revisited and new questions asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any task has to start from a point of self-critique before it can be defended in the public sphere. Naivety can be turned into an asset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He professes respect for those who believe South Africa's cultural imperatives preclude the indulgence of an &quot;overseas&quot; curator, albeit one born in Africa. He also seems to understand the frustration of the artist as (critic's) ventriloquist's dummy and the imperatives of self-enunciation, free from the interventionist powers of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, when you're hip-hopping between the conflicting worlds of New York and Lagos, it's tough being labelled anything other than &quot;other&quot; -- a mute object of curious fascination. Perhaps his insights into the prejudices of cultural perception have equipped him to avoid the traps that ensnare cultural nomad-cum-colonialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One always imagines oneself as both global and particular. One has to constantly renegotiate one's own sense of belonging. I come from a position where so many boundaries have been crossed, resulting in a very complicated picture of what it is to be African in the late 20th century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds: &quot; South Africa seems to identify and define itself in terms of pre- and post-isolation. These are the new boundaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is therefore not entirely unexpected -- and only partly due to post- modern trends like globalism (a concentration of diasporas), cultural pluralism and nomadism -- that Enwezor's exhibition proposal for the Biennale, Trade Routes, revolves around the theme of boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My metaphoric starting point is the Cape Point, the meeting of the Atlantic and Indian oceans, the main sea trade routes, from which ecomonic imperatives and agendas have produced incredible cultural consequences. I don't want artists to illustrate my ideas, or attempt interventions in search of great projects. I want -- not simply object-makers -- but thinkers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And hopefully the odd trickster in the pack, or two.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The enduring memory I have from addressing a group of pro- government students at the University of Cape Town recently is the expression &quot;you must not say ...&quot;. They objected to hearing opinions and points of view different from their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These students had probably not interacted with a senior representative of the Azanian People's Organisation (Azapo) before. They and their predecessors of the 1980s in the South African National Students' Congress (Sansco) would have been discouraged by their political leaders from discussing issues with anyone outside their own camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This starkly contrasts with the willingness of Steve Biko and his peers to hear out and tackle opposing views on any issue. Yes, there has been a shift from that ethic, and from many other views and values formulated by the founders of the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM). While this shift has been made by dominant parties in the 1990s, it should not be imposed on those who continue to uphold the validity of black consciousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction of the students was sparked off by a challenge to them as black intellectuals to break with the legacy of white academics who stunted the capacity of Africans in tertiary institutions to think broadly. Ever since Tom Lodge declared Azapo an organisation of &quot;intellectuals&quot; in his book on South African politics, the black component of his allies developed a fear of being seen as &quot;intellectuals&quot;. The BCM, on the other hand, rooted in community project work as the basis of training black leaders, not only allows, but encourages its members to think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most common argument around the life and work of Biko from the 1980s is the childish set of claims as to where he would be had he still been alive.  These arguments originate from claims by organisations to which Biko never belonged. Those who have exercised their free choice to leave the BCM and join the ruling party tend to withhold that same right of free choice from those who have not left the BCM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever organisation Biko would have been part of is not the issue. The issue is that several co-founders of the BCM have endured hardship and privation, not only from the former settler-colonial state but from components of the left, and yet have remained loyal to the movement. Those of us who worked with Comrade Biko will recall that, unlike in the Hollywood film, he was not surrounded by nodding acolytes, but engaged in vigorous discussion with comrades ready to contribute verbally and in writing to the growth of revolutionary ideas and activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most tragic desertion of Biko's heritage are the unwillingness to sacrifice and the continued failure of predominantly black political parties to pursue the call for mutual respect and co-operation emanating from Biko and the BCM. As black people overcome the false hopes of reform and development through the 1994 process, Azapo in its reorganised form will grow and be the vehicle through which the new generation and disillusioned elements of the old will rediscover the life, work and meaning of Biko.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Mogadishu must be the most divided city on earth. Several distinct factions confront each other across great swaths of wrecked buildings and empty streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is not just one front line, there are two. In the city centre lies an area known jokingly to the Somalis as the &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot;. If you venture in, you are unlikely to emerge alive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a clear dividing line between southern Mogadishu, held by the faction of the late General Mohammed Farah Aideed, and Ali Mahdi Mohammed's northern Mogadishu. Even when there is little fighting, the line is nerve- racking to cross. In the silence of no-man's land, the buildings are appallingly smashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filming here can be an unhealthy business. Our camera crew was filming in no-man's land for the British Broadcasting Corporation's Newsnight the other day. It seemed peaceful enough, but suddenly a group of militiamen turned up and arrested them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One militiaman took up a position in a doorway beside the car, put a round into the chamber of his AK-47, slid off the safety-catch, and aimed at the cameraman's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was then that our bodyguards earned their money. The best and toughest of them, &quot;Little Ears&quot;, walked quietly across to the man with the AK, took him by surprise and smashed him in the face, knocking out his front teeth.  After that, the crew managed to get back to the relative safety of our hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that force is the only thing that can succeed in this Hobbesian world of warfare. Nothing short of calculated violence would have sorted out that situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those of us who want to believe in more rational and peaceful ways of behaving, Mogadishu forces us to reconsider -- just as it destroyed the good intentions of the United States and United Nations troops who intervened here between 1992 and 1995. This is a place where ferocity seems, depressingly, to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Mogadishu is controlled by the militias loyal to Hussein Aideed, the US-educated son of the late general who died of wounds on August 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His gunmen are reasonably well-disciplined, but they can do what they like here. As a result the streets are quiet and tense, and the shopkeepers operate nervously. At night the area is completely dark. Any European venturing out then is effectively committing suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you cross no-man's land, you pass from an area where the gun is the only law to one in which the most savage punishments are restoring a kind of order.  The streets of northern Mogadishu bustle with economic life, and you rarely see a gun. There are even a few policemen around. At night, the streets are properly lit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This part of the city is run by an uneasy alliance between the pragmatic Ali Mahdi and the leading Islamic cleric in Somalia, Sheikh Alidheri. Two years ago, Alidheri forced through the introduction of sharia courts to try offenders according to Islamic law and subject them to its punishments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are, by Western standards, ferocious. The theft of goods worth more than about R10 means the loss of the right hand. If a gun is used in the crime, the left foot is cut off as well. As we made our way to Alidheri's court, we came across a severed hand and foot lying abandoned in the dust.  Someone had just suffered the penalty for armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later we obtained a tape, filmed with a small video camera, of a man having his hand and foot cut off at Alidheri's court. It is done fast but casually, and there is no anaesthetic. When we examined the pictures in a BBC cutting room in London, they were so revolting that the picture editor had to leave the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Realising how Westerners would react to sharia punishments, Alidheri made sure we were unable to watch a serious case. Instead, our cameraman was allowed to film a woman being tried for the theft of a dress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial was fair and properly conducted, in a smallish, oppressively hot, upstairs room. After the owner of the dress had given evidence, Alidheri turned to the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you agree that what she says is correct?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, and I want forgiveness,&quot; she answered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was impossible, but mindful of the camera the sheikh chose to be lenient. The owner of the dress had not taken proper care of her property, he found; and he sentenced the accused woman to 48 lashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time the pictures were just acceptable to a Western television audience. Although the woman was frightened and weeping it was clear she was not in great pain. Without the presence of the camera the whipping might well have been a great deal fiercer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For us, watching it all, the spectacle was ugly and degrading. Yet this ferocious, exemplary justice has quietened the streets of northern Mogadishu.  We may not like the sharia courts and the punishments they inflict, but nothing the supposedly civilised world can come up with has worked as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The majority of people in northern Namibia who have testified before a crime-combating commission, want the reintroduction of the death penalty for rapists and murderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, which started public hearings in Oshakati this week, was told that the Constitution should be amended to allow the death sentence for serious crimes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who did not support the reintroduction of the death penalty called for life sentences for rapists and murderers. All those who testified were against granting bail to people accused of serious crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who have testified so far include business people, headmen, teachers, farmers, leaders of political parties and community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also support for the return of corporal punishment, especially for children who did not obey their parents, teachers or the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also a call for heavy sentences for those who defrauded the government. &quot;We fought for our independence but now there are some elements who are spoiling our peace by raping and killing innocent people. The government must see to it that peaceful people are protected,&quot; one person told the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said a new war was sweeping the country and criminals had to be punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also calls for one law in the land because of confusion over traditional and judicial laws. Some felt a referendum should be called so that people could air their views on crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Public Protector Selby Baqwa's baptism of fire over the Sarafina II debacle has drawn a mixed reception from political parties and commentators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Inkatha Freedom Party slammed his performance, saying Baqwa had been &quot; unfair to the public which demands transparency&quot;. The party's health study group deputy chair, Jeanette Wilikazi, said he was &quot;just protecting the donor at the expense of the public&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party representative Willem Odendaal said the party did not think Baqwa had dug deep enough. He added that the South African Communications Services had recommended that Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma opt for a cheaper and better awareness programme. But Zuma turned down the R5-million project and went for Sarafina II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Friedman of the Centre for Policy Studies at Wits said that if Baqwa's ruling meant that any anonymous donations were acceptable he had failed as public protector. It appeared from Baqwa's slightly confusing report that he would sanction anonymous donations as long as the auditor general and the public protector knew the donor's identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This meant he was not protecting the public, for the only reason anyone would ever give an anonymous donation was to hide they were getting something in return. Friedman said by permitting any anonymous donations Baqwa was making &quot;retrogressive changes&quot; to the treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political scientist Robert Schrire was more forgiving, saying Baqwa had steered a pragmatic path between the need for transparency and accountability and keeping in with political players -- &quot;a pass mark&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Auditor general Henri Kluever backed his fellow watchdog saying he supported the recommendations that treasury legislation be amended to make it explicit that names of donors could be kept confidential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kluever added that the names of donors should only be kept confidential after close scrutiny by the treasury, the public protector, auditor general and director general of the department which would receive the donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fully support the public protector's recommendations (about amends to treasury instructions), but I cannot comment on the constitutionality of the matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kluever said he was surprised that the Sarafina II donor pulled out at this stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party's Mike Ellis said he believed Baqwa had fulfilled his mandate. &quot;I had been concerned that his investigation was not full enough, but after reading his report I believe that he is a man of integrity and worth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baqwa said: &quot;In this regard, it is recommended that an additional provision be added to the effect that donations made -- of which the donor's identity for good reasons is kept confidential -- should be acceptable as long as the political office bearer and the accounting officer concerned are satisfied that there is no impropriety or conflict of interest, and the identity of the donor is made known to the public protector and auditor general.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Colonel Eugene de Kock, the man billed as South Africa's most accomplished assassin, will round off one of the country's most extraordinary murder cases when he goes into the dock next week to explain how he and secret police agents under his command carried out many of the old government's most notorious dirty tricks campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former commander of the South African police's counter insurgency unit based at Vlakplaas was found guilty this month in the Pretoria Supreme Court of six murders, two conspiracies to murder and more than 80 counts of gunrunning and fraud: a mix of political and criminal felonies that is probably unprecedented in South African legal history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a series of investigations into the activities of the hit squads that operated out of Vlakplaas and a network of satellite bases around the country in the 1980s and early 1990s show that the acts which the colonel has been convicted of are just a small portion of the bombings, murders, assaults and assassinations carried out by the unit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock is expected to begin his testimony in mitigation of sentence next week with an account of a career in the South African Police that spanned some of the violent and traumatic periods of this country's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His life story will begin with experiences during the bush war in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe),include the unconventional campaigns that were used against Swapo guerrillas in South West Africa (now Namibia), and explain how these methods were then turned against opponents of apartheid inside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the current trial deals primarily with the colonel's criminal activities, it is believed he will turn the attention of the court and the public to the full spectrum of his unit's activities. De Kock's motive will be to convince the court that he and his colleagues were driven by a mix of right-wing doctrine, stress sustained during counter-insurgency operations, and instructions from above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His appearance in the dock, which is attracting local and international media excitement, is likely to provide unique insight into the psychological make-up of the people who resorted to extreme human rights abuses in order to extend the dying days of apartheid. After De Kock, who has seldom given interviews to journalists, has told his life story, a psychologist and criminologist will present their insights into the mind of a man at the centre of some of the country's most tumultuous events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed De Kock realises his only chance to obtain some kind of reprieve or a reduced sentence is to give the court a full and frank account of his past. He is thus expected to name more than 10 police generals and at least two former cabinet members -- most likely ex-police ministers Adriaan Vlok and Hernus Kriel -- as the men who gave the Vlakplaas unit its orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of further trials involving political leaders and security force officers are also likely to result from the testimony that he will give to the court next week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The public protector, Selby Baqwa, has been asked to investigate alleged corruption by senior government officials during a takeover of Paternoster Fisheries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paternoster's plight was highlighted at a parliamentary portfolio committee hearing in June which investigated complaints in the fishing industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee decided Baqwa should investigate the downfall of the village.  &quot;The story of how once-vibrant and thriving villages have been brought to (their) knees and entombed in abject poverty is a depressing tale of greed, corruption, government mismanagement and overfishing,&quot; the committee said in a report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delli Walters, whose grandfather started fishing in Paternoster in 1911 and built the Kliprug village for his staff, caused a stir at the hearings when he claimed a former government minister helped deprive his family of their fishing rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walters said his family's problems began in 1957 when Santam Bank's general manager advised his father, Dawid Walters, to form a company to pay less tax.  He did so, but Santam employees were also issued shares without his knowledge and gained control of Paternoster Fisheries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1960 his father's crayfish quota was registered in the name of Paternoster Fisheries without his knowledge and his shares were sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walters said his father laid a complaint, but the attorney general refused to prosecute because &quot;important people&quot; were involved in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next few years, Jan Haak, then deputy environment minister, Louis Pienaar, who later became environment minister and Albertus Marais took control of Paternoster Fisheries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dawid Walters got a court order making the company's books available to him, but they were stolen before he saw them. He again laid charges, but was told the attorney general refused to prosecute because of the high-profile people involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walters said the Department of Sea Fisheries discriminated against him after the company was stolen from his family. When his boat ran aground, the department refused to transfer his sardine licence to a replacement boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1975, his licence to pack crayfish at the Paternoster factory was withdrawn. In 1982 he was the only private boat owner refused a crayfish quota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paternoster residents are also attempting to investigate who holds quotas in the name of their community. In the run-up to the 1994 elections, the National Party instituted a system of community quotas which was to extend fishing rights to traditional coloured fishermen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system has since been discontinued, but the Paternoster Women's League discovered that a community quota for five tons of crayfish had been allocated for 30 fishermen in the village. None of the fishermen received a cent from the proceeds of the catch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are sitting here quietly starving to death while someone out there is sitting pretty with our money,&quot; said league member Mabel Bailey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women are also attempting to find out whether Pierre Pharo, the last owner of Paternoster Fisheries, still has a quota. They suspect he is using it to catch crayfish somewhere else.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The traditional lifestyle of a small fishing community in the Cape is being destroyed by developers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fisherfolk living for generations on the beachfront in Paternoster are being forced out of their homes to make way for tourists and have now discovered they were probably robbed of their right to the riches of the sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The village, about 180km from Cape Town, has attracted scores of holiday- makers to its pristine beach and tranquil surroundings, but locals say their arrival has brought racism to the village for the first time in its history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its name, Latin for &quot;our Father&quot;, was bestowed hundreds of years ago by shipwrecked Portuguese sailors. Legend has it they were so grateful to survive that they knelt down on the beach and said several &quot;paternosters&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the descendants of those sailors and indigenous people have been living off the sea. But fishing quotas have been drastically reduced in recent years and landowners in Paternoster are looking to tourism to keep the village alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some fisherfolk are refusing to move from their cottages, believing they have a historic right to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cecelia Corizon is determined to die in the cottage she has lived in for 29 years in a section of Paternoster called Valplaas. The stone-walled, three- roomed house was built by her father-in-law and after three generations of Corizons were born in the house, she refuses to budge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of her neighbours have been moved to a suburb called Kliprug, where starter houses have been provided by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corizon and her husband worked for Paternoster Fisheries. Although she was only employed during the crayfish season, she managed to send her son to university &quot;with a lot of help from God above&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989 her husband was told by his doctors he was no longer fit to work.  Although he had worked for Paternoster Fisheries since he was 14, the company made no provision for his retirement. The couple now survive on a state grant of R410 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This house is owned by the Pharo family. They owned Paternoster Fisheries, but a few years ago they closed down the factory and disappeared,&quot; Corizon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to move, all the families who live here in Valplaas are like one big family. We don't lock our doors and we don't hesitate to help each other. I had flu recently and was in bed for two weeks. Every night my neighbours brought food for us to eat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if I'm the only person left in Valplaas, I'm staying here ... People who say apartheid is dead should come and see what is happening in Paternoster. Apartheid is very much alive here. It was only after 1990 that coloureds were forced out of their homes here to make way for whites,&quot; Corizon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paternoster councillor Paul Sampson says the only way community leaders had been able to secure land tenure for the villagers was to invoke the Group Areas Act in 1989 to pave the way for state assistance for coloured families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until then, 100% of the land in Paternoster was owned by private landowners. The fishermen were allowed to live in the cottages, but if they no longer worked for the company, they were forced to move out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the Pharo family closed down Paternoster Fisheries and disappeared, community leaders grappled to find permanent homes for the fishermen. We managed to persuade the owners of Kliprug to sell their land and got government funding to build homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said although the Kliprug homes were smaller than the beachfront cottages and did not have the views, they offered security to hundreds of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders had battled to find a way to secure tenureship for residents living in the Valplaas cottages, but had failed. &quot;Mr Pierre Pharo owns the land and we have been unable to trace him since he left Paternoster,&quot; Sampson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kliprug, tears flowed as residents related their history and their struggle to survive without the right to fish in the waters which had fed generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we were moved from Valplaas I had to leave most of my furniture behind because it couldn't fit into my new house. One day I'm going back to my old home,&quot; vowed Mabel Bailey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our grandparents built those homes. They carried every stone down to the beach on their backs. If that doesn't make those houses ours, then I don't know what will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't pay rent in the cottages at Valplaas, but we worked ourselves to the bone for the fishing companies. My husband used to earn about R100 a month during the crayfish season. When the season ended, all we got was R10 a week as subsistence pay. We had to feed our families on that money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey cried as she told of the hardships her family suffered after Paternoster Fisheries closed down. She said last Christmas she had no money and no food to make even the simplest stew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have our pride, it's the only thing we have left. Since the factory closed, the women spend all day together in each other's homes. I can't even offer them a cup of coffee. I know they're going to kitchens as empty as mine, but we don't talk about that at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our lives are bitter ... In the old days there was always fish to eat. Now you need to get a quota before you can catch anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Corizon's husband's application for a quota was turned down by the Quota Board and he was forced to seek work in a factory in Saldanha Bay, about 20km away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My husband used to earn R24 a week at Paternoster Fisheries. Some weeks he came home with as little as R4. If the boats were damaged, he would spend all day at work repairing them and not get paid a cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The company would lend us money for food. When it closed down, my husband owed them R800.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corizon said a few of Paternoster's fishermen owned boats and caught fish to feed their families. Children gathered mussels and the surplus was sold illegally at roadsides to earn some money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In winter, when the sea was rough, the men could not go out for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you say to a child who comes asking for bread and you don't have any to give him? I can't keep sending my children to my mother or my neighbours at supper time. Some days it gets so bad I sit on my bed all day and cry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corizon and others have formed a womens' league to battle for their rights.  They have persuaded the municipality to improve the Kliprug houses by installing electricity and painting the exteriors, and intend lobbying the government for a fishing quota and their land rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(National Party MP) Abe Williams came here in 1989 and said he would help us fight for our rights, but all he did was buy land for himself as well,&quot; said Corizon. &quot;That land belongs to the people of Paternoster, we've started a petition to protest against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams said the area was part of his constituency when he was elected to parliament in 1984 and he had to intervene frequently when residents' rights were threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People were being forced to move from Kliprug as well as Valplaas because the owners saw the potential for tourist development. They tried all kinds of tactics to keep people out,&quot; he said. &quot;It was unfortunate that I had to use the Group Areas Act to safeguard them, but it was the only solution I could find.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams denied that he was given any &quot;favours&quot; when he purchased a 487m2 plot in Paternoster. He said the community was so grateful for his assistance that it insisted that he be given the right to own land in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Paternoster residents had to accept the fact that the beachfront property would never belong to them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Mega-university Unisa is sinking under the weight of deepening labour-related crises. Vice-chancellor Marinus Wiechers says he is considering using deadlock procedures and dispute resolutions allowed under labour law to resolve continuing troubles on campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff and academics on the Pretoria campus have called for his resignation, saying Wiechers failed to provide effective leadership during recent problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I refuse to accede to the alliance's demand for my resignation,&quot; he said.  The alliance consists of the Black Academic Forum, the National Education Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu), the National Students' Representative Council and the South African Students' Congress (Sasco).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to the mounting troubles on campus is the mud-slinging among various professional staff organisations. The largely white South African Parastatal and Tertiary Union (Saptu) recently embarked on a two-day mass action, virtually bringing the university to its knees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alliance in response undertook &quot;counter-mass action to the white anti- transformation strike&quot;. It accuses Saptu and the university's management of attempting to retain the &quot;apartheid status quo&quot;. In the middle, the Unisa management flounders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiechers says neither he nor the campus is under siege: &quot;Obviously, if things are not going at the pace people want, there is only one person to blame -- me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has raised temperatures to boiling point in the unions is a single point in a five-point memorandum presented to the university council by the alliance in August. It called for a &quot;moratorium ... on all white appointments and promotions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council resolved that a moratorium be placed on all appointments and promotions at Unisa, irrespective of race, pending the outcome of an evaluation by a committee into recent appointments. This brought Saptu out with all guns firing, saying the council's decision was not legally valid and was a breach of contract because it did not involve Saptu in the decision.  The union went on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alliance then accused the secretary of the university council of falsifying the minutes of the council, and Wiechers of misinterpreting the letter and spirit of the council on the moratorium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiechers dismisses this out of hand. In an open letter to staff, he said: &quot; It is management's responsibility to lead and guide Unisa through this endeavour (transformation), but management alone cannot achieve success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only point the various unions seem to be able to agree on is that management is not &quot;leading and guiding&quot;. Annelise Hartzenberg, chairman of Saptu, is on record supporting Wiechers. &quot;But we do have critisms of management in general,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a sentiment shared by the chairman of the Black Academic Forum, Professor David Mosoma, and the secretary general of the Academic and Professional Staff Association (Apsa), Niko Coetzee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apsa's executive says it has been forced by management's unilateral conduct and uncompromising attitude to endorse a confrontational stand. Together, the three unions represent more than two-thirds of staff on the Unisa campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosoma and the alliance are demanding the removal of Wiechers. &quot;The vice- chancellor, who was present at the council meeting, has demonstrably taken sides with Saptu and is, therefore, against the decision and authority of the council,&quot; the alliance says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiechers argues that the council is bound by a collective agreement with the other unions, and says he has been at pains to explain that to the alliance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A high-powered team of parliamentarians was this week set to probe disclosures that South Africa continues to import toxic material for recycling --- even though the Cabinet has assured the public it will ban such consignments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint meeting of Parliament's portfolio committees dealing with health, trade and industry, and the environment was this week planning to hear evidence that South Africa is still trading in toxic waste with other countries in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Albertyn, national co-ordinator of the Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF), was due to brief the team of MPs about information his organisation has collected to show that the government is still allowing shipments of hazardous materials to come into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the briefing, African National Congress parliamentarians will quiz Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin in Parliament about his department's policy regarding toxic imports. They will also demand details about the kind of poisons that have been brought into the country since the new government took office in 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa has told the European Union (EU) that it intends to continue importing toxic wastes from non-Organisaton for Economic Co-operation and Development (industrialised) countries, particularly via its African neighbours. This controversial position was communicated in July this year in a seven-page written statement from the South African embassy to various parties in the EU,&quot; said an EJNF statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By adopting a policy of permitting the importation of hazardous wastes, South African negotiators with the EU are contradicting the public position of this government, as well as the policy of the ANC and the Congress of South African Trade Unions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EJNF made this information public after Green Party politicians in the European Parliament informed local environmentalists that Pretoria's embassy in Brussels had acknowledged South Africa still imports &quot;hazardous waste for recycling from a number of countries in the region&quot;, and that its government was reluctant to endorse clauses in the Lome Convention that would outlaw this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A South African negotiating team recently visited Brussels to negotiate the terms of the country's access to the Lome Convention, which governs trade and development relations between European states and ACP (African, Carribean and Pacific) countries. The Green Party politicians say it was these talks that revealed South Africa is involved in an ongoing trade in industrial poisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomats from the South African embassy in Brussels reportedly told European officials they were disturbed by sections of Article 39 of the convention which stipulate &quot;the ACP states shall prohibit the direct or indirect import into their territory of such waste ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They added that South Africa currently imports waste for recycling from a number of countries in Africa, and that a viable industry would be destroyed if Pretoria endorsed this article of the Lome Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the portfolio committees have been briefed on the growing controversy, ANC parliamentarians will demand that Erwin answer a series of tough questions in Parliament about the nature and extent of this country's involvement in the international toxic waste trade since 1994. They will also quiz Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Environment Minister Pallo Jordan about whether officials in their departments knew of or approved such shipments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa has signed the Basel Convention, which will ban all movements of toxic waste between industrial and developing countries from January 1998.  But this international agreement does not prohibit trade in toxins between countries in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EJNF officials fear overseas waste is being routed into South Africa via neighbouring states and that Department of Trade and Industry officials are reluctant to accept the Lome clauses because they would close this backdoor route for bringing in the dangerous but lucrative materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said the EJNF: &quot;The argument of Trade and Industry negotiators to the EU is that South Africa needs to do our Southern African and African neighbours a favour by importing their wastes. They argue that if South Africa accepted Article 39 of the Lome Convention, 'unscrupulous concerns' dumping toxic waste in neighbouring countries would have no option but to continue doing so.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement notes, however, that South Africa does not have waste- processing facilities to handle its own waste. &quot;If South Africa was serious about assisting its neighbours with their toxic waste problems, we would engage in activities that build our mutual capacity to handle our own problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Now that the dust has settled on the Constitutional Court's ruling, federalists are realising that they got less than it had at first appeared. Only a fraction of the main political parties' complaints succeeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said the court: &quot;The basic structure of the Constitution is sound and the overwhelming majority of the requirements of the Constitutional Principles have been satisfied. The instances of non-compliance that have been identified should present no significant obstacle to the Constitutional Assembly in formulating a text which complies fully with those requirements.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did the main political parties score?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Democratic Party attacked the bulk of the clauses in the Constitution which had anything to do with regulating provincial powers to persuade the court there had been a substantial reduction in them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Away from the provincial powers, its other objections included the absence of a clause guaranteeing employers the right to lock out. The DP did score a direct hit with its attack on the clause governing the independence of the auditor general and the public protector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Inkatha Freedom Party's saturation bombing of the Constitution's provisions for provincial powers was unsuccessful. The party attacked virtually all the constitution's angles on provincial power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It complained the final text had departed from the interim constitution in undermining provinces' ability to change their names, create armed organisations and raise gambling taxes. It said the principle that minority parties should be allowed a role consistent with democracy had been undermined and that the principle which offered communities the chance of &quot; self-determination&quot; had not been honoured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It objected to the clause which allowed the National Assembly oversight of all organs of state and homed in (successfully) on the final Constitution's handling of local government, particularly the reduction of provincial control over it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The National Party argued that the test for whether there had been a substantial diminution of provincial muscle was whether as a whole there were fewer powers. The DP and the IFP, on the other hand, examined each individual provincial power guaranteed by the final text to see if the provinces had got a raw deal. The court took the NP's global approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP hit out at the ease with which national government could now override provincial legislation, and at the weakening of the provinces' financial and fiscal powers. It also gunned for the omission of a lock-out clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Constitutional Court wants to make it more difficult for the Constitution to be changed by a strong ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament's power to write and re-write the Constitution has been a controversial point in negotiations between political parties since Codesa, when talks broke down over the dispute between the African National Congress and the then National Party government on what sort of majority was needed to pass and change future constitutional provisions and the Bill of Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while, at that point, the dispute centred on the passing of the final constitutional text after the 1994 elections, the fear that haunts the debate remains the same: to what extent should a majority party be allowed to control the writing and re-writing of the negotiated constitutional provisions, which were part of the political settlement or treaty which ended apartheid and the liberation movement's armed struggle?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment the ANC is just short of a two-thirds majority -- just strong enough to be threatening, but too weak to make amendments without the support of the NP, at least. Opposition parties are fearful that, come the next election, the ANC will garner more than the required two-thirds majority and then the Constitution will be its oyster.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Principle XV serves as a guarantee for nervous opposition parties and sceptical political observers: &quot;Amendments to the Constitution shall require special procedures involving special majorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitutional Court said in its judgment that this principle was not entirely satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it accepted a two-thirds majority in Parliament was a special enough majority with which to pass constitutional amendments, it did not think the new text created a sufficiently special process by which amendments could take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is of course not our function to decide what is an appropriate procedure, but it is to be noted that only the National Assembly and no other House is involved in the amendment of the ordinary provisions of the new text; no special period of notice is required; constitutional amendments could be introduced as part of other draft legislation; and no extra time for reflections is required,&quot; the judgment said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitution-makers will have to think of a process which satisfies the court's understanding of the word &quot; special&quot;. That process will have to differ from the passing of normal legislation, and possibly grant people who oppose such amendments greater opportunity to contest them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential adviser Professor Fink Haysom said there were a range of mechanisms to use, indicating that a parliamentary portfolio committee might be mandated to scrutinise all constitutional amendments and that they could also bring in the provinces to discuss amendments. He said a new procedure would not necessarily make amending the constitution more difficult for the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roelf Meyer, the NP's secretary general, indicated this week that this was one area on which his party would like to do some creative thinking. &quot;We would like to delve in this area,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources within his party were bolder in stating they thought the NP ought to take this opportunity to build added protection for the Constitution in the final lap of negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party's Colin Eglin said it was preparing an extensive response to the Constitutional Court judgment and would be taking the judge's reservations on this issue very seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitution-makers are also going to have to think of a way to create special protection for the Bill of Rights, following the court's instruction, based on Constitutional Principle II, which demands that rights be &quot; entrenched&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment says: &quot;A two-thirds majority does not provide the bulwark envisaged by the constitutional principle. The constitutional principle does not require that the Bill of Rights should be immune from amendment or practically unamendable. What it requires is some 'entrenching' mechanism ...  which gives the Bill of Rights greater protection than the ordinary provisions of the New Text.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This part of the judgment has been welcomed by the Human Rights Committee.  Spokesman Susie Cowen said this week: &quot;We are happy that the court wants the CA to set out the procedure for the amendment because it will make this section stronger and give the Bill of Rights greater protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), in a quandary after the snubbing of the KwaZulu-Natal constitution, cannot decide whether or not it should return to the national constitutional negotiating table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the Constitutional Court did refer the issue of provincial powers back to the national constitution-makers for revision, the judgment allows little scope for Inkatha to push its separatist agenda in the final lap of negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially Inkatha has not yet discussed the judgments, but senior Inkatha sources say they were discussed at the weekend, but no clear route had emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP negotiator Walter Felgate says decisions about returning to the Constitutional Assembly will be taken next week during the party's national council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP party advisers such as Mario Ambrosini had muttered, prior to the Constitutional Court judgment, that should the matter of provincial powers be referred back to the CA, there would be reason to return to the CA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the cautious ruling of the court on the reduction of provincial powers does not give Inkatha much of a foothold from which to launch its arguments for greater federalism, and should it return, it would probably be a short stay, after which it would walk out again in frustration at not being able to entrench provincial autonomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the provincial route has been closed down with the setting aside of the KwaZulu-Natal constitution. In crude terms, it means Inkatha will have to join the last lap of national negotiations if it wants to have any impact on the new South African constitutional order at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly international mediation is no longer an option. This has been raised by Inkatha spokespeople following the judgment but time has blunted it as a lever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not open that issue,&quot; said an African National Congress source. &quot; They know we cannot turn the debate back by two years and reopen it at that spot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela's adviser Professor Fink Haysom said: &quot;I think by participating in the Constitutional Court case, the eyes of the IFP may have been opened to the fact that the terrain they thought they had monopolised -- the whole provincial-national debate -- had been comprehensively discussed without them, and one almost got an impression that some of them belatedly thought they would have liked to have participated in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What adds to the party's problems is that the ANC and the NP have got so used to their absence that they are no longer missed. The problem of violence in KwaZulu-Natal has been separated from the constitutional debate through ANC-IFP peace plans, and can no longer be used by Inkatha as a veiled threat to coax a compromise from the ANC on international mediation or provincial powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the IFP cannot rely on much support form the NP, which is determined to pursue its own course of action and to find common cause with the ANC, as soon and efficiently as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Inkatha's return will make no difference to us,&quot; said Meyer yesterday, looking a little weary at the thought of more hours of constitution-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC is relieved by the NP's response so far, because senior negotiators want, at this stage, to keep disputes to an absolute minimum. A frequent response from ANC members is that most of the adjustments needed are &quot; technical&quot; and can be handled by lawyers rather than politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party's Colin Eglin sees it slightly differently: &quot;Lawyers can come up with the legal solutions but politicians have to take the decision. I certainly would not say that these things were merely technical because they are fundamental to the rule of law and effective governance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment in brief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* LOCAL GOVERNMENT: The final text was too vague on how local government should work. Entire chapter on local government rejected. Perhaps the stiffest challenge for the Constitutional Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* INDEPENDENCE OF WATCHDOGS: Final text made it too easy for government to fire the auditor general and public protector. The interim constitution said these watchdog officials could be sacked only with the backing of a two- thirds majority in Parliament; new Constitution said 50% majority would suffice. The officials' independence is seen as a crucial check on one-party state rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* LABOUR RELATIONS: Individual companies were not guaranteed the right to engage in collective bargaining as offered by interim constitution. Court rejected calls for guarantee of lock-out clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION: Constitution should be supreme law of the land, so clauses shielding the Labour Relations Act and the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act from the Constitution were rejected.  Court also wanted stronger protection against constitutional amendments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* PROVINCIAL POWERS: Constitution had watered down several of the provinces' powers, while providing a new structure for political expression, the Council of Provinces. Not a &quot;substantial&quot; power cut on its own, but with potential for excessive national control &quot;substantial&quot; test met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION: PSC's independence inadequately protected; definition of PSC too vague, making it hard to tell if provinces had been cheated of rights to set up their own PSCs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa has reached the last lap of its Constitution- making process, but the court's judgment of the text means setbacks for the ANC and frustration for Inkatha. Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rejection of the Constitution's chapter on local government by the Constitutional Court has provoked consternation among African National Congress negotiators -- because it interferes with their local government programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local government gurus within the ANC fear that revising the chapter will restrict the ANC's freedom to develop the sorts of local governments it wants and needs to win votes over the next decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitutional Court sent back the whole chapter on local government, asking for greater detail of differing municipal structures, legislative processes and finances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is problematic for ANC negotiators and government officials who have yet to take the necessary policy decisions to fill in those gaps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy director general of constitutional development, Andrew Boraine, said this week: &quot;It's not as bad as it looked at first ... but I am worried about the effect it will have on the White Paper process. We wanted to first look at the role of local authorities and then decide on the most appropriate structures: we wanted structure to follow function. Now we are being rushed to finalise the structures before we have had a really deep look at what municipalities should be doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boraine said, by way of an example, that municipalities overseas were heavily involved in health care and education, and that remained an option his department wanted to think about before committing itself to structures in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really wanted to take a number of months over the White Paper but that will now have to change. It's a difficult issue because government is not formally involved in the Constitutional Assembly, but we will have to describe a whole number of options in the chapter on local government so that we don't tie ourselves down unnecessarily,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concentrating on the constitutional chapter means that attention will be diverted from the local government bridging legislation, which was to be passed in Parliament this year, throwing a carefully planned timetable out of kilter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boraine and a number of ANC strategists believe the Constitutional Court judges have not fully appreciated the chapters on local government in the interim and new constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter chapter was kept deliberately short, simple and vague to give it the necessary flexibility to allow for local government to develop over the next eight years, adapting itself as it went along to the conditions of the country and the political needs of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This approach has been spearheaded politically by senior ANC negotiator Pravin Gordhan, who convinced the constitution-makers to wrest local government away from provincial governments in the new constitution and make it an autonomous level of government, beholden only to the centre. This was also the foundation for the White Paper process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the Constitutional Court is demanding what they hoped to achieve in years, before November. It will cut short the opportunity for consultation on these structures, which is considered crucial. And it will also bind the government to local government structures with which they have had no opportunity to experiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an interesting conundrum, because its almost entirely the ANC's.  Opposition parties have supported the local government dream which has been growing quietly in strength and political importance since the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there is a second leg to the conundrum, in which Gordhan and Boraine find themselves. There is a danger that their work might be further undermined by the impulse from other quarters in the ANC to pull local government from its autonomous shelf, and submit it again to provincial government control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, this has already been hotly debated within the party, with negotiators such as MP Johnny de Lange proposing that local government be sacrificed on the altar of compromise, to balance out the powers of the province with the powers of the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an internal tussle, the idea was resisted, meaning that the ANC had to agree to the final draft of the Constitution, suspecting that the provinces had been denuded of too many powers to meet the demands of the constitutional principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their suspicions were confirmed last week, when the judgment was handed down, although the court indicated specifically which areas tipped the balance. It pointed to two clauses -- the national override and the clause setting national norms and standards in government delivery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC legal experts, such as presidential adviser Professor Fink Haysom, are taking their cue from the judgment and saying that attention to those two clauses will be sufficient to correct the imbalance and that there is no need to play with the finely balanced plethora of provincial powers woven into the text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the court does point to other reductions of provincial power, areas in which opposition parties might wish to delve. If the debate shifts from the two suspect clauses into a general scrutiny of provincial powers, the ANC might feel obliged to submit local government again as a power up for negotiations rather than give provinces greater power over policing, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would not rule it out, but at the moment it does not seem to be an option,&quot; said Boraine cautiously this week. A senior ANC negotiator, Dirk du Toit, said that there was a chance that this could happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The provincial government's role in local government must be reconsidered and it must be done to ensure practical results,&quot; Du Toit said. Should this happen, it will make a new local government chapter even more difficult to complete for certification.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African Communist Party criticism of the government's macro-economic framework has come under fire in the African National Congress's national executive committee (NEC) -- from no less a person than President Nelson Mandela himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he did not mention him by name, it was widely understood that Mandela was referring to SACP deputy secretary general Jeremy Cronin when he laid down the line in an ANC NEC meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's ire was apparently stoked by a reference Cronin had made -- in a paper critiquing the new framework delivered at a party seminar -- to the danger of the ANC-led government becoming an induna state if it found itself in the position of keeping workers in line on behalf of capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One source said Mandela was &quot;very upset&quot; about party members criticising the ANC and the government, &quot;and putting on the ANC hat when it suits them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some party members believe Mandela had not read the document but acted on the basis of a briefing: they feel he may have been misinformed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was mischievous -- someone trying to cause trouble between the party and the ANC,&quot; said a source. &quot;But this is not the first time there have been crossed wires and tensions around the relationship. It's about an issue, not the relationship between the alliance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said another source: &quot;There is no doubt several senior comrades in the ANC want to ensure the party is not a viable opposition -- they are trying to silence the voice of the left within the alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The party has mass sympathy and legitimacy and this presents problems for the ANC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SACP was relatively muted in its response to the framework when it was first unveiled by the government, saying it approved of its objectives but that the detail had to be scrutinised. But ANC and alliance structures were not fully briefed ahead of the Cabinet's decision to endorse the framework and this led to questions being asked about internal democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government had adopted the framework but not the structures of the ANC or the alliance. The ANC did not take the decision, cabinet did. As an NEC member, Cronin had a legitimate right to discuss strategy,&quot; said a source. &quot; If they didn't take it to ANC structures first, that's their fault -- they run ahead of their constituencies and that causes problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members were concerned that the culture of debate was under threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the culture of debate is quashed it's more likely the ANC will lose touch with its constituency. The macro-economic framework was badly managed -- it was thrust on people, alliance members were confronted with it,&quot; said one source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another source said the question of open debate was &quot;not only an issue at NEC level -- at the regional and provincial level people are being told to get in line and shut up. As soon as the NEC endorsed the macro-economic framework the line came down to branches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tragedy of it all is that the kind of critical questions being raised (about the framework) have to do with whether it is capable of meeting the objectives of the RDP, which is a cornerstone of ANC policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Warring factions in the African National Congress Women's League have been told to patch up their differences and come together to jointly plan a crucial and long-overdue national conference to take place before the end of December, when fresh leadership elections will take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move marks the start of what ANC leaders hope will lead to a thaw in relations between the league and the 11 national executive members who, led by ANC veteran Adelaide Tambo, staged a walkout in February last year over league president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes after the decision, in July, to freeze the league's funding, a move interpreted by Madikizela-Mandela as an attempt to sabotage the league's Women's Day programme and &quot;punishment&quot; for it coming out in support of Bantu Holomisa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the decision was supported by those who see the league as having degenerated into little more than a faction within the ANC, serving less to advance the interests of women within the organisation than as a platform for Madikizela-Mandela to launch attacks against the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salaries of national and provincial staff are still paid, but directly by the ANC. There is no longer discretionary slack with which to spread patronage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative arises out of a decision by the ANC's national executive committee at its last meeting, where an assessment of the league concluded that it was a crucial organ if the ANC was to be seen as serious in addressing gender issues, and needed to be brought back on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Past efforts to heal the rift have not been successful and the intervening period has seen attitudes harden and relations between key league figures deteriorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Divisions at executive level spread to the regions, with loyalties split between those backing Madikizela-Mandela and those supporting Tambo and her colleagues, further hampering the work of the league.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC head of political organising, sports minister Steve Tshwete, and ANC treasurer general and chief whip, the Rev Arnold Stofile, have been put in charge of spearheading the initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the weekend they met national and regional league leaders as well as members who resigned from the executive. Madikizela-Mandela was ill and did not attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshwete said there was &quot;a spontaneous desire for unity, an affirmation of the role the league is destined to play as the leading structure of women in the country and the realisation it could not carry out its mission with disunity in its ranks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, if league members failed to work together, or there were obvious attempts to derail the unity process, the ANC would have to take appropriate steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not saying it's the last chance for the league -- we want to resuscitate it and give it the integrity it deserves. But we're not going to countenance any mischief-making.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">League national executive council member Lulu Xingwana said she hoped the new initiative would heal divisions. &quot;We are all committed to unity and to making the league work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 30-member preparatory committee for the conference is to include members of the current leadershp as well as members who had resigned from the executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A smaller committee will manage conference logistics, and he and Stofile would sit on both structures, Tshwete said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the start of a healing process. We hope that bringing people together at national level will send a message to the regions that the problems are being resolved,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freezing the league's funds was not aimed at incapacitating its leadership or rendering it ineffective. However, it was necessary to alert the league to its dependence on the ANC and the need to resolve its problems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A confidential briefing document sent to African National Congress organisers warns that sacked deputy minister Bantu Holomisa intends mobilising support against the decision to expel him and suggests urgent action to &quot;neutralise&quot; his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it emerged this week that senior ANC members tried to warn President Nelson Mandela that his decision to axe the former Transkei military leader could have damaging repercussions for the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela, angered by Holomisa's refusal to heed his appeal that he apologise, went ahead. The organisation is now counting the cost.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The briefing document says Holomisa is using his previous status as Transkei leader &quot;as a tool to confuse membership on the ground&quot; and that he is &quot;presently holding meetings in the informal settlements in the Western Cape&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It suggests a &quot;clear and common approach&quot; towards disseminating information about the case against Holomisa, and the disciplinary committee's ruling be structured within ANC structures, &quot;including the alliance and MDM (Mass Democratic Movement) formations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urging that &quot;we act fast and decisively to neutralise the campaign of the comrade&quot;, the document says Holomisa's &quot;target areas&quot; should be identified and structures there be &quot;mobilised and informed&quot; as part of an attempt to isolate his campaign as far as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Structures or comrades &quot;feeding into the campaign&quot; should also be identified and disciplined: this week, the ANC's Thokoza branch suspended its deputy secretary for organising a rally addressed by Holomisa soon after his expulsion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document suggests &quot;a single position&quot; on Holomisa be taken to grassroots level and that the emphasis shift only where applicable, to cater for regional or provincial dynamics. Provinces, regions and branches should &quot; be prepared to deal with these issues if requested by our membership&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the Gauteng region of the ANC called a meeting of the chairpersons and secretaries of its branches and those of its alliance partners, the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party (SACP), as well as the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco). The meeting reportedly concluded that Holomisa was &quot;not welcome&quot; in the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern in ANC leadership circles over the way the affair has been managed focuses not so much on the possibility of Holomisa leading ANC members into a breakaway party (he is credited with being a better soldier than politician), but on the damage the continuing saga is inflicting on the organisation itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some ANC MPs blame the media for repeating Holomisa's allegations and innuendo without checking their veracity -- and for conveying the impression that Holomisa was being punished for speaking out against corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the media can hardly be blamed for not ignoring such spectacles as Holomisa (a &quot;sewer rat&quot;) and Gauteng premier Tokyo Sexwale (an &quot;opportunist&quot;) slugging it out in a no-holds-barred slanging match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many ANC MPs feel that the lack of a considered approach in dealing with the matter has led to a mountain being made out of what could have remained a molehill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It started with allegations he made about (public enterprises minister) Stella Sigcau at the truth commission and now it's a huge internal fight in the ANC,&quot; said one source this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serious damage has been done to the ANC at the grassroots level in terms of the legitimacy of ANC leadership, which has been brought into question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the ANC leapt into damage-control mode -- with Sexwale receiving orders from on high to restrain himself -- a defiant Holomisa took his seat in the National Assembly on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hopes to retain it by launching a court action against the ANC's decision to expel him, when (there is no longer a question of if) it is ratified by the ANC's national executive committee (NEC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sooner they rubber-stamp the thing the better, and I can deal with it in a court of law which will be neutral. I think I have a strong case,&quot; Holomisa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior ANC leaders were this week impatient for the disciplinary committee's decision to be ratified by the NEC, believing it would lay the matter to rest. It has been delayed due to &quot;logistical problems&quot;, but will now take place on September 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the ANC's problem lies with its decision to refrain from engaging Holomisa in the media -- the arena he says he chose to prosecute his fight after ANC secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa first told the press he would be disciplined before informing him personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the NEC serves as the appeal body, the ANC leadership could not easily counter Holomisa's claims without running the risk of prejudicing the appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been difficlt for NEC members to express their opinion for fear of prejudging the case. We wanted it so that at the end of the day, whatever the decision, he's been treated fairly,&quot; a source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Going to the people to explain to them is quite difficult now, given that the matter is sub judice. People have the misunderstanding that we acted against him because he went to the truth commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perceptions on the ground, in the Western Cape at least, reflect alienation from the party's power structures, creating a vacuum readily filled by explanations as plausible as they are improbable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An example of these explanations is that Holomisa's axing is part of a purge launched by deputy president Thabo Mbeki to ease his path to the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But people's concerns are real and do not appear so far to have been adequately addressed -- partly because of the weakened state of the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We mandated people and they used to come back for fresh mandates. Now nothing filters down. Only the leadership knows,&quot; a Guguletu branch member said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We the oppressed are on Holomisa's side. If the NEC does not overrule the decision we will protest, we will go to the ANC offices. We feel it is Stalinism and that we can't tolerate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa, who has nothing to lose, is going for broke. The ANC finds itself entangled in an altogether more complex equation, with much more at stake.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A Document that dissects weaknesses crippling the African National Congress's potential to overturn National Party dominance in the Western Cape and spells out a new strategic path for the party has given a fresh twist to the race for ANC leadership in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 16-page document, ANC: A Home for Everyone -- A Political Plan for the ANC in the Western Cape, is an attempt to raise the level of debate ahead of the ANC's Western Cape congress on September 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says if the Western Cape is to be &quot;liberated&quot; from NP rule, the leadership debate should go beyond &quot;the sterile politics&quot; of &quot;naming names and putting people into positions&quot;, and seek instead to answer the question of who can provide the ANC with a vision to revitalise the organisation -- and a plan to implement it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of our energy is spent on convening meetings, talking about recruitment and fighting petty fights -- and not about building the ANC's profile, asserting its leadership, discussing the range of issues which confront us politically and planning how we reach the masses of people who look to us for leadership,&quot; the document says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It decries a lack of political leadership, which saw the ANC unable to capitalise on confusion in NP ranks after the party withdrew from the government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the NP defined the issues around which the local government campaign was fought, the ANC remained defensive, unable to switch the debate to delivery, local issues and the calibre of its candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It relied on nationally produced posters &quot;almost irrelevant to the pace set by the NP&quot; and was &quot;by and large invisible&quot;, with candidates' posters either absent, late or too few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building a majority in the Western Cape meant overcoming a tendency &quot;to be static in terms of our ideas, leadership and organisation&quot;, and recapturing the vibrancy of the eighties &quot;with its feel for mass work and the support we enjoyed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document, coming at a time when the leadership race looks set to come down to being between justice minister Dullah Omar and Western Cape MEC for health and social services Ebrahim Rasool, is a significant intervention.  Gauteng-based ANC MP Carl Niehaus this week announced his withdrawal in favour of Omar; support for ANC MP Tony Yengeni is uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one disputes Omar's leadership qualities. But there is concern that the demands of his weighty portfolio will see him function as an absentee leader when the region can least afford this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also speculation that some of Omar's support lies with those who would want him reliant on deputies to run the region, keeping control within more or less the same hands -- people said to push a strong Africanist agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outgoing leader Chris Nissen says he wants new blood to take the ANC through to the 1999 elections, but it is known his unwillingness to stand lies partly with difficulties he has had from these quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document sheds light on these and other tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamenting a tendency to be &quot;static in terms of our ideas, leadership and organisation&quot;, it urges &quot;a new, open political culture ... that treats debates on merit and doesn't dimiss ideas with labels such as 'colouredism' or 'africanism' &quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This alienated activists, whether &quot;stalwarts in Guguletu or UDF activists in coloured communities&quot;, while a shut-down on debate meant ordinary members were &quot;becoming cynical&quot; about taking part in meetings because they felt decisions were taken by &quot;factions, cliques and cabals&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;tendency to increasingly narrow the base of decision-making and power within the ANC&quot; was alienating not only &quot;citizens, members and branches but also anyone in the ANC not privy to a certain group, or an inner circle of the provincial executive committee (PEC).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inclusiveness should be the starting point for broadening the ANC's Western Cape base, which meant accepting the need to make the ANC &quot;comfortable for coloured communities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the majority, and the ANC's only hope of expanding its one-third support to the 45%, it needed to win an election, and coloured communities had to be at the centre of any strategy. Yet calls for their increased involvement met the &quot;stock response&quot; that the Western Cape was once a coloured labour preference area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ignored social ills, including gang violence, unemployment and lack of housing -- and assumed, falsely, that because apartheid was applied differentially, so should solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, delivery should be balanced to respond to severe backlogs in the African community &quot;and simultaneously affirm coloureds as an important and vital strand in the South African rainbow&quot;. The concept of &quot;African leadership&quot; also had to be examined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioning whether it was still relevant, the document said the notion was a &quot;bone of contention for many progressive coloured activists who believe there are unequal relations within the ANC and unequal treatment of coloured and African communities and comrades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to assert our common Africanness despite our diversity and to insist the ANC is an organisation of equal members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crux of the problem was the role the PEC should be playing in concert with regional alliance leaders in the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PEC could no longer operate largely in isolation of ANC government and constitutional structures, believing that it was the political centre and everything else &quot;just levels of deployment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It needed to rethink its role as an &quot;inclusive political centre&quot; that made sense of events, co-ordinated the different nodes of ANC power and resources and served as a point of accountability. &quot;If the PEC and the alliance leadership does not play this role, then the ANC is incoherent, leadershipless and without direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This may be the crux of our current problem,&quot; the document says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Mbongeni Ngema's musical career has not fallen apart in the midst of the Sarafina II controversy, but the financial uncertainty around the future of the Aids education musical has angered some of his friends in the entertainment industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngema, whose production company Committed Artists was evicted from its Durban offices last month after Sarafina II's long-awaited &quot;mystery&quot; donor failed to cover nearly R26 000 in rent arrears, is busy &quot;creating&quot; a new show which is expected to open at the Natal Playhouse at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johann Zietsman, CEO of The Playhouse Company which runs the Playhouse, said details of Ngema's new production were still being worked out, but that it was &quot;likely to be choral in nature drawing on the strong choral base in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're thinking of something with a strong gospel message,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, said Zietsman, Ngema's 1994 musical Mama was continuing to tour internationally and The Playhouse Company, which owns the production, was &quot;beginning to show a net profit, which almost never happens&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zietsman said the new choral production -- expected to open for Christmas -- would fulfill Ngema's current obligation to &quot;direct, choreograph, or compose&quot; one show annually in his new role as artistic director of the company's musical theatre department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngema's contract was renegotiated earlier this year after agreement that his former position as the department's director &quot;was not ideal for either us or him&quot;, said Zietsman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his old contract, he was also in charge of the administrative and management side of the department. It didn't allow him the kind of freedom to do the other things he does outside of the Playhouse,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zietsman said Ngema no longer had administrative duties, but continues to advise the company on artistic planning issues and is engaged annually in some form of production: &quot;He's like a visiting professor at a university,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zietsman said the controversy around Sarafina II had only &quot;tangentially&quot; affected the Playhouse: &quot;It's only affected us on a perceptional basis if people think we have something to do with Sarafina, which we don't ...(Ngema) needs to sort himself out with the government, but we have had no problems with him and it hasn't affected our work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngema's Committed Artists, however, appears to be another story. Evicted from its Windermere Road offices last month, the company appears to be in a state of limbo as the controversy rages on. Suppliers say they don't know where to contact the company to send bills for services and Ngema himself has been keeping a low profile. His office said he was in Johannesburg this week and repeated efforts to contact him were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry Acres, managing director of the Johannesburg-based company which provided sound and lighting equipment to Sarafina II, this week said his company was preparing to write off between R50 000 and R100 000 in debts owed to it in connection with the production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decribing Ngema as an &quot;ex-friend&quot; due to the fiasco, Acres said he did not know who to confront about the debt or where to send the bill since the closure of Committed Artist's offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acres said Pro-Sound had recieved payment in full for equipment it provided in terms of a tender contract to the Health Department, but that &quot;tens of thousands&quot; in oustanding bills for service fees, personnel training and transport had not been paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acres said Pro-Sound had been engaged in an affirmative action effort to train black sound engineers and other technicians to set up, operate and otherwise assist the production, and the money for this training was not paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acres believed the Health Department was at fault as it had &quot;failed to set up an appropriate administrative infrastructure to oversee the production.  They should have known that an artist won't be a good administrator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevetheless, Acres said he had lost money on the show and Ngema was not his &quot;favourite person at the moment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African National Congress is going through some tough times: In the Western Cape, the party is trying to redefine itself, as is its women's league. And that Holomisa affair just won't go away. Gaye Davis reports</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Durban millionaire Vivian Reddy this week hit back at the Democratic Party with claims that the party's &quot;vicious&quot; criticism of Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma were backed by powerful interests in the pharmaceutical industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lashing out at DP health spokesman Mike Ellis after he gave credence to reports linking Reddy to Sarafina II's R10,2m mystery bail-out, Reddy said he would ask Public Protector Selby Baqwa to probe alleged links between Ellis and the pharmaceutical industry, which has opposed Zuma's drug policies. &quot;We have reviewed Hansard and Ellis has been quick to criticise Zuma at every turn. We believe vested pharmaceutical interests are behind his constant attacks on the minister,&quot; Reddy alleged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddy claimed he had &quot;documentary proof&quot; that pharmaceutical interests had paid for a recent visit by Ellis and his family to the Far East. He hoped the matter would come up in this week's parliamentary debate on the question of anonymous donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellis denied &quot;vehemently&quot; that any pharmaceutical company had influenced him or any of his political decisions. He also denied any ties with any pharmaceutical company. But he admitted he had been on several trips, with his wife, which had been funded by pharmaceutical companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had been to the Far East twice last year with the foreign affairs committee, to London with Smithcon Beecham pharmaceutical company along with former director general in the Health Department Manto Tshabalala and the editor of the South African medical journal. He said four years ago he and his wife went to the Far East to attend the international Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association biannual conference, and this trip was paid for by Hoechst, a German company. He said in 1991 he and his wife went on a study tour of Europe which was paid for by various pharmaceutical companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellis also said Reddy's personal attack may be related to his &quot;guilty conscience because the DP is still waiting for a sum of money he promised us before the 1994 elections&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mirryena Deeb, on behalf of the Pharmaceutical Association, said she knew of no such sponsorship by the association, but that individual companies may have hosted Ellis or other MPs on visits to industrial sites in other countries. Deeb said a request had been made to members of the industry to host a visit by some members of the parliamentary health committee to the United Kingdom last year, and Ellis may have been part of the delegation, but stressed that this was &quot;definitely not an initiative of the association&quot;.  Deeb said the industry had made its repesentations on its concerns about Zuma's drug policy &quot;directly to the minister&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela this week, however, backed Reddy's allegations that the industry was behind recent criticism of Zuma. Speaking after the mystery donation was cancelled under pressure for dislosure, Mandela said the Sarafina saga was a &quot;smokescreen&quot; for efforts to target Zuma by medicine conglomerates which she had taken on.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The investment company named in this week's controversy over the ill-fated R10,5-million Sarafina II rescue bid is run by a motley crew of African National Congress-aligned businessmen -- three of whom featured in a drugs probe by the party's intelligence wing two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The R500-million investment firm SAM-Sisonke, which is backed by the Malaysian concern Asia Pacific, was named by the Sunday Times as closely connected to the bid to rescue Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma from the Aids- play bungle. The &quot;white donor&quot; referred to by Public Protector Selby Baqwa was a &quot;front&quot;, it claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, President Nelson Mandela announced the donor had withdrawn his offer to pick up the Sarafina II tab. Malcolm Serman, the white donor's lawyer, said the offer had been withdrawn as &quot;what had been intended as a solution had become an additional problem&quot; for Zuma due to &quot;the growing acrimonious media debate&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baqwa, in his final report on the aborted donation, on Wednesday said he had not found it necessary to &quot;go on a witch hunt on the basis of unsubstantiated rumours in the press&quot;, as Auditor General Henri Kluever, once the donation was made, would establish whether the donor was bona fide -- and that he stuck to his decision not to expose his identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baqwa said &quot;it would appear from press reports that (SAM-Sisonke chair) Vivian Reddy had already denied any connection with the donor&quot; and that Zuma assured him &quot;there is to the best of her knowledge no connection between (Reddy) and the donor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Reddy this week stopped short of flatly denying to the Mail &amp; Guardian his involvement. He said: &quot;No money has been transferred from my company to the Health Department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media speculation has also had it that the true origin of the intended funding went back to a source &quot;close to the president&quot;. Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana denied there was any truth to this. &quot;The president told me in no uncertain terms this is not true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddy, asked whether he would have been one of what was alleged to have been a three-stage process intending to hand over the donation, said: &quot;I know all three tiers. I'm involved in SAM-Sisonke, I know all the minister's friends and I'm known in the president's office.&quot; In a Durban press report after the announcement of the donor's withdrawal, Reddy offered to stand in and pick up the tab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddy's co-directors in SAM-Sisonke include four former members of the ANC's Department of Intelligence and Security (DIS), which was later integrated into the new National Intelligence Agency (NIA). They are Sam Prakash, Lawrence Petersen, Liza &quot;Gibson&quot; Njenje and Jomo Mavuso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petersen and Mavuso were both subjects of an ANC DIS probe into drug smuggling allegations in 1994, and both were suspended as bodyguards to Mandela that December. It was reported at the time that the probe was looking at an entertainment venture, the New African Foundation, in which Petersen, Mavuso and Njenje were reportedly directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New African Foundation had been the brainchild of Austrian businessman Rainer Maria Moringer, who earned a reputation as a &quot;sanctions-buster&quot; when he set up an aircraft factory -- which made &quot;spotter&quot; aircraft said to be suitable for military application -- in the Ciskei in the mid-Eighties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moringer was reportedly involved in plotting an abortive coup against Ciskei leader Lennox Sebe in 1989. That same year a warrant for his arrest on multi-million rand fraud charges was issued in Austria. Two years later he was acquitted of R5,5-million forex fraud charges in Johannesburg. It could not be established this week whether Moringer is still in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An intelligence operative this week told the M&amp;G that Petersen and Mavuso's suspension followed an incident at Lanseria Airport involving a large Mandrax haul uncovered by another DIS member, whose name was given to the M&amp;G. The operative claimed the incident also put an end to Njenje's ambitions to fill a senior post in the NIA or its external counterpart, the South African Secret Service (SASS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DIS spokesman Billy Masetla was reported early last year to have said the investigation was &quot;nearly complete&quot;. But this week the end result remained unclear. A spokesman for Masetla, who is now director-general of SASS, referred inquiries to his NIA counterpart, Dr Sizakele Sigxashe, who he said had &quot;signed the final report on the matter&quot;. An NIA spokesman said Sigxashe would not comment as it was &quot;an ANC matter&quot;. Petersen, Mavuso and Njenje could not be reached for comment at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddy, who is also the multi-millionare managing director of Durban-based Edison Power, made his fortune filling electrical contracts for the old tricameral parliament's House of Delegates, but has built close relationships with several ANC leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Described by his critics as a man who &quot;always backs the winning horse&quot;, Reddy first built relations with ANC members aligned to Public Works Minister Jeff Radebe, who then served as chairman of the ANC's southern KwaZulu-Natal region. When Jacob Zuma won the.race for the KwaZulu-Natal ANC leadership in the run-up to the 1994 election, Reddy moved quickly to build links with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prakash said this week that &quot;some of the speculation (about the Sarafina donor) is becoming embarrassing. Somebody is on a fishing trip and they are trying to point fingers at people who have been involved with the struggle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prakash had worked with Petersen, Mavuso and Njenje for some time and said SAM-Sisonke was formed primarily as a construction company seeking involvement in South Africa's housing industry. The company also intended building clinics and schools, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddy told the M&amp;G after a Tuesday telephone conference with Baqwa that &quot; the Sarafina donor will never be known, or else there will be no donation&quot;.  He said he understood Kleuver had also accepted the donor's anonymity after he met Baqwa to discuss the issue on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the proposed donor withdrew his offer the next day, Zuma blamed the media for not respecting the donor's wish to remain anonymous. The M&amp;G established that Reddy flew unexpectedly to Cape Town about the time the announcement was made that the donor had withdrawn his offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddy earlier said the donor's anonymity condition was rooted in a fear that &quot;his other business will suffer. Anytime he wants to bid for a government contract, everyone will start asking questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Home Affairs official Jaco Duckitt is a man of initiative.  In a bid to do his duty and uphold the law, he flew to Tanzania this year to establish the identity of man he suspected was masquerading as a Rwandan refugee and bribed his Tanzanian counterparts to help him with the search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duckitt, who heads the Refugee Department at Home Affairs in Cape Town, said it had all started two years ago when a man claiming to be Rwandan applied for political asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Kaibinda Muhire (22), said he had fled from Rwanda in 1994, and travelled to South Africa via Zaire, Zambia and Namibia in an empty petrol container.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He arrived in South Africa in July 1994 and was given a temporary permit for political asylum by Home Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then got a job at Waltons Stationery Company, enrolled for an engineering degree at a local technical college and started to put down roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duckitt, however, said he was sure all along Muhire was lying and he was in fact an illegal immigrant from Tanzania, chancing his luck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just knew, things he said and did, experience told me,&quot; said Duckitt.  Possibly on Duckitt's recommendation, the Refugee Board turned down Muhire's application and told him to leave the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhire went to court to appeal against the ruling and was represented by attorney William Kerfoot of the Legal Resources Centre, who was convinced he was Rwandan. The court set aside the Refugee Board's ruling and called for Home Affairs to give reasons the application had been rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point, Duckitt realised gut instinct would not be enough to prove the point before the judge and fearing the case might be lost, decided to venture further afield to find hard evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He set off in July, and got a friend to meet him at the airport. His friend became his guide and aide in a long journey around Arusha to find the Muhire family. During this search, he found he had to grease the palm of many government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Tanzania you cannot get anything done with government officials,&quot; Duckitt said with big, surprised eyes this week. &quot;You have to bribe them for any little thing ... the guy I was with said to me, you either pay or the guys won't talk to you. I had to pay about $100 in bribes. I gave my friend my money and he was flashing it about here and there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after arriving in Tanzania, Duckitt realised that he would not be able to trace Muhire through the government's records. The key to the quest would be a photograph of the man in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanzanian officials and a number of other friends Duckitt made during the week in the streets of Arusha advised him to start looking for the man's friends and family at soccer matches over the weekend. That Sunday Duckitt did a tour of the soccer teams with the photograph, and on the third team he hit jackpot -- one of the players recognized Muhire from the picture and told him where the family lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duckitt and his friend spent a day hunting the family down and by nightfall had located them, in a little village, not far from the city. The family recognised the picture of their son, and they were, according to Duckitt, really angry that he was masquerading as a refugee in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His mother must have blown six or seven gaskets when she found out. She was very angry because he had promised to send her money and he had sent nothing. They had not seen him for about three years,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duckitt took statements and further photographs of the family, and of pictures of the prodigal son that were hanging in the house, and then made his way back to Cape Town where he promptly arrested Muhire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhire called upon Kerfoot for aid, but after two hours broke down and confessed to him that he was in fact, Tanzanian. He was repatriated shortly afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a triumphant day for Duckitt -- the offical who had gone the extra miles off his own bat on a matter of principle. The victory was particularly sweet because he is regularly taken to court by lawyers protesting against rulings on refugees. Duckitt said that 20% of all applications for refugee status contain fictional information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know there are night schools in Cape Town which school people on how to be a refugee and how to answer the questions they know I will put to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we get six or seven people who come to me at once, and they were all born in the same place, have travelled on the same vehicle, same plane, same seat even ... then we know that they are lying and have been told what to say.  &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa's censors have banned public viewing of the movie Kids and are even considering prohibiting private ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kids is by all accounts a disturbing movie. While HIV-positive Jennie lies half-comatose on ecstasy after visiting a night club, she is raped by a teenage boy -- just one scene from the new movie which immediately had the South African censors reaching for their &quot;banned&quot; label.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Clark's debut movie Kids has earned the distinction of being the first movie to be tossed into the trash can in the new South Africa by the director of publications.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision is likely to stir controversy but, the censor feels so strongly that he is considering slapping an illegal possession rap on anyone found in possession of the movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer Anant Singh's Videovision Entertainment owns the South African rights to Kids and will be appealing against the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kids contains virtually no scenes of nudity, but there are &quot;scenes of explicit copulation movements and orgasmic or mechanical sounds,&quot; the publications board said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to reviews in The Guardian of London, Clark's movie is about a day in the life of a gang of white teenagers, in the Upper East Side of New York, who spend their time hanging out, skateboarding, bashing people, puffing monster joints, guzzling beer and having sex with virgins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considered by some to be a breakthrough in its upfront portrayal of America's youth, the movie first claimed the spotlight at Robert Redford's Sundance festival before receiving acclaim on the official selection at this year's Cannes film festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, artistic achievement aside, the movie's moral depravity and &quot;lack of merit&quot; has resulted in a banning under the old (1974) censorship act rather than the new act, which has yet to be approved by parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But David Wilson of Motion Picture Marketing said that Kids would most likely also be banned under the new act, since it deals with under-age sex and the new act stipulates that 18 is the minimum age for depictions of sex acts on screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Bill Wilson of the prestigious UK movie magazine, Sight &amp; Sound, few people would find this movie shocking if its primary subjects were inner-city black kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is clearly not a view shared by the censor. In his letter to the distributors of Kids, he refers to the fact that some of the characters in the film don't seem to be older than 12 or 13 although it is stated in a scene that the girls are meant to be 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The film also contains scenes portraying lesbianism, sex orgies and frequent shots of teenagers doped into oblivion and some violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the light of the current wave of sexual exploitation of children and paedophile cases given prominence in the media, it was agreed that the present film can only do harm,&quot; the censor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His distaste was also fueled by scenes of groups of boys and girls discussing their sexual exploits in a &quot;crude and vulgar manner&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crude language in the form of 'fuck', 'fucking' and 'motherfucker' and some profanities abound,&quot; the censor board said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Derek Malcolm, renowned film critic of The Guardian, described the movie as both &quot;true to life&quot; and &quot;fake as hell&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is like a documentary, with actual people doing actual things, but it isn't one: the cast is not under age, since it couldn't be by law ... Even so, Kids is a fairly remarkable film since it makes you confront things you'd do anything to avoid either as relatively uninvolved spectators or as anxious parents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tat Wolfen of the Free Media Lobby has questioned the constitutionality of the ban under the provision of freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who is to decide what is in the interest of the public? This sounds like a return to the bad old days of the censorship board under the National Party,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate development, the censor board has decided to overturn its January ban of the art movie The Doom Generation as long as two cuts are made where they consider there are vulgar references to Christianity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The National Party has refused to confirm or deny that it received a multi-million rand donation from business tycoon Sol Kerzner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian understands Kerzner gave the NP about R2-million before the 1994 elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sun International had not responded to questions put to it before going to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NP regards the relationship between a donation and a party as an honorary arrangement and therefore we do not comment on matters of this nature. If, however, a donor wants to publicise such donations it is the donor's privilege,&quot; said a spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP is in a defensive position on Sol Kerzner, with the parliamentary justice committee calling for former state president FW de Klerk to explain why Sol Kerzner had not been extradited to face questions about bribery in the former Transkei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP claimed there was no prima facie case for extradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Committee Chair Johnny De Lange said this week he was waiting for Justice Minister Dullah Omar to read the documents which dealt with the decision that there was no prima facie case for extradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The minister must provide us with all the information and then we will decide if it is necessary to call previous cabinet ministers (before the committee),&quot; said De Lange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela admitted recently Kerzner had donated R2-million to the African National Congress before the 1994 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerzner however had long-atstanding links with the National Party when he began developing casinos in the former Bantustans when gambling was illegal in South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The man who gave the orders to shoot when 30 people were killed by Ciskei soldiers at Bisho in 1992 -- and then allegedly played a role in blocking an effective probe into the massacre -- is now a military general in charge of transforming the old apartheid armed forces into a cohesive national army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence presented this week by former Ciskei attorney general Jurie Jurgens at a special truth commission hearing dealing with the causes of the Bisho massacre indicated thatMajor General Marius Oelschig, a man who now holds a strategic post in the highest echelons of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), played a role in scuppering earlier efforts to find those responsible for the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurgens said he had instructed the Ciskei police to open 30 dockets of murder &quot;relating to the random shooting at the demonstrators&quot;, but a number of organisations had hindered his effort to prosecute the perpetrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the truth body that Oelschig -- former head of the Ciskei Defence Force who admitted in separate testimony to the truth commission this week that he gave the first orders for his soldiers to fire on a crowd of demonstrators -- had subsequently created major problems for his criminal investigation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A fourth, and major obstacle was the lack of co-operation from the then Ciskei Defence Force,&quot; said Jurgens. Oelschig, then a brigadier in charge of the Ciskei army, had promised his support during the attorney general's investigation. &quot;However the co-operation promised was not forthcoming, especially when certain details were sought and when all the firearms on the scene of the massacre were sought for ballistic tests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurgens said Oelschig had given him a &quot;top secret&quot; report from a military board of inquiry into the massacre which was of some value for the attorney general's investigation. But he noted that &quot;feeble&quot; excuses had been given by Ciskei military officials under Oelschig's command when the police demanded access to witnesses and weapons used in the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney general's evidence contradicted Oelschig's earlier claims to the commission that he had &quot;responded expeditiously to every request to assist in all investigations and enquiries into the Bisho tragedy&quot; and had &quot; co-operated fully, had provided all the information and documentation at my disposal and had told the the truth at all times&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contradictions between the general's evidence and that supplied by the attorney general raises serious questions about why a man who played a key role in one of the worst massacres in this country's history is now in a position to oversee the military's adaptation to democratic conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his testimony to the commission, Oelschig admitted he had given the first authorisation for Ciskei soldiers to open fire on demonstrators at the Bisho stadium in September 1992 because he had received reports that some of the troops were being shot at by members of the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he realised the shooting was &quot;not of a defensive nature, that it aimed at neutralising the immediate threat&quot; he gave an order three times for the shooting to stop, said the general. &quot;I am unable to say who gave the orders to fire on the ground, or in which terms those orders were communicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These claims were also contradicted earlier by ballistic expert Jacobus du Plessis who told the commission there was no evidence that demonstrators had fired upon soldiers, and that many of those killed had been shot in the back while running away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separate investigations by the Mail &amp; Guardian show that parliamentary defence committee chair Tony Yengeni is investigating allegations that Oelschig has been involved in irregularities over a R50-million management consultant contract to transform the SANDF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rival consultants have complained about the award of the transformation tender to leading consultancy Deloitte &amp; Touche who allegedly developed close ties with Oelschig while he was working with the firm on another military transformation consultancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general's military background makes him a startling choice as the man tasked with leading the armed forces in shedding its apartheid legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His career has included a substantial stint in military intelligence at a time when this wing of the defence force played a key role in coordinating the apartheid's &quot;total strategy&quot; against its political opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a member of Military Intelligence's (MI) directorate of special tasks and responsible for co-ordinating logistics to Angola's right wing Unita movement at a time when the South African military was smuggling poached ivory supplies out of Southern Africa to offset the massive costs incurred in providing the rebels with war material. He then became the military attache to France, a post which almost certainly involved liaising closely with the MI officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he returned to South Africa he took up another post with army intelligence, before becoming chief of the Ciskei Defence Force in 1991.  Oelschig was seconded to the homeland at the height of a dirty tricks campaign designed by MI to ensure that Ciskei military ruler General Oupa Gqozo would help quash anti-apartheid uprisings in the Eastern Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Astonishingly, key players in manipulating events in Ciskei through the South African Defence Force's covert MI fronts were not called by the truth commission to give evidence. There is a substantial amount of reliable information that MI fed false intelligence to the Ciskei over a sustained period which influenced former leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo's African National Congress stance and crackdown on his political opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992 Oelschig, fluent in both Portuguese and French, returned to the national army and has since been involved in various transformation projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his controversial career he was promoted by Defence Minister Joe Modise to the rank of major general in March 1995 and appointed as the SANDF's chief director of transformation management.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following are portions of the remarks by Ileana Ros-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lehtinen, chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa in the U.S. House of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives, at the opening of a subcommittee hearing on September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When discussing, formulating, and implementing U.S. foreign policy,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we always try to strike a delicate balance between the overall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">objectives of promoting democracy and respect for human rights, with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">specific U.S. security concerns. We must always be conscious of our role</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the international political arena and within the international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community of nations. But, most importantly, we must always be focused</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on safeguarding U.S. interests and protecting the rights of our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">citizens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why we are here today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Subcommittee has had and will continue to have numerous hearings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on issues affecting the people of Nigeria and the daunting challenges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they confront as they struggle toward another attempt at democracy. We</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have also held forums to establish the correlation between Nigeria's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">internal situation and its effect on U.S. security interests -- both</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">domestic and foreign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, it can be argued that political corruption in this West</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African nation is certainly one of the more serious problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">threatening, not only the future of Nigerian democracy, but also U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">domestic and international interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are, therefore, here today in our role as public servants -- as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;guardians&quot; to quote Plato -- of the people of the U.S. We are here to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">delve into how this systemic corruption has gone beyond the boundaries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Nigeria and is directly victimizing U.S. citizens. We are here to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">delve into how U.S. entrepreneurs have fallen prey to Nigerian Advance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fee Fraud losing millions of dollars, as well as endangering their lives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the interim, when they are convinced by these criminals to travel to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria to complete the transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian Advanced Fee Fraud is known internationally as &quot;4-1-9&quot; fraud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after the section of the Nigerian penal code which addresses fraud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">schemes. It manifests itself in seven distinct fraudulent business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proposals. These are: Disbursement of Money from Wills; Contract Fraud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(C.O.D. of Goods and Services); Purchase of Real Estate; Conversion of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hard Currency; Transfer of Funds from Over Invoiced Contracts; Sale of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crude Oil at Below Market Prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of these, the most prevalent and successful is the fund transfer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scam, which our witnesses will explain in detail during their testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all instances, however, the goal of the scam artist is to delude</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the target of their scheme into believing that he is being drawn into a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">very lucrative arrangement. The intended victims are reassured several</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">times as the scheme unfolds to ensure that they will willingly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contribute a large sum of money to secure the deal when it is threatened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- and it will be. As will be discussed, the underlying theme to all the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">schemes is their elaborate nature. There usually is a con-within-the-con</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or two phases to the fraud -- one being the original proposal to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intended victim and the second layer being the threat to the venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all instances, doubts or questions from target victims about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arrangement are allayed by the use of forged or false documents bearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seemingly official Nigerian government letterhead and seals -- as well</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as false letters of credit, payment schedules and bank drafts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dramatic increase in Nigerian advance fee fraud has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attributed to numerous factors as diverse as the schemes themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the indisputable facts, as will be confirmed by our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">witnesses, are that it is an extremely profitable illicit endeavor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grossing hundreds of millions of dollars annually. This must be stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is that the welfare of too many communities and the fortunes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of too many families and groups are at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the U.S. government has recognized the threat posed by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud schemes and the intricate illicit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">infrastructure (they have) created -- a network spilling over into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">numerous other illegal activities also of grave concern to the U.S. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. is addressing the problem from an interagency perspective in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hope that a coordinated approach will result in a comprehensive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">assessment and solution to the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here to further educate us on the intricacies of Nigerian Advance Fee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraud schemes, and on U.S. efforts to curtail the problem, are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representatives of the Department of Commerce, Department of Justice,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is testimony before the Subcommittee on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa in the U.S. House of Representatives by Mark M. Richard, deputy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">assistant attorney general, on September 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to be here today to testify before</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">your Committee about what has become a growing problem in the United</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States -- both white collar and drug trafficking offenses which are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being perpetrated by Nigerians, generally from the safety of Nigeria. My</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">name is Mark Richard and I am Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal Division at the Department of Justice and I plan to shed some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">light on the nature of the offenses that the Department is confronting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and what we are doing to combat these egregious acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. WHITE COLLAR CRIMES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian nationals are involved in perpetrating a variety of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">financial and other crimes upon U.S. citizens and businesses from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">safety of Nigeria. These crimes include credit card, insurance and bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frauds. Of perhaps greatest concern is a particular type of fraud scheme</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that has been appearing with greater frequency -- the advance fee or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">letter frauds, commonly called &quot;4-1-9&quot; schemes after the section of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian penal code that criminalizes fraud offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most common &quot;4-1-9&quot; scheme to emanate from Nigeria has been the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deluge of letters sent through the mails and by telefacsimile, proposing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fictitious &quot;business opportunities,&quot; most of which are a cunning ruse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intended to both appeal to the recipients' greed and to lull the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recipients into silence. The letters -- which are the opening</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">solicitation in a crude but effective advance fee fraud scheme -- offer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to share a percentage of a very large sum of money with the recipient --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">generally $20 to $60 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruse is that the potential victims are told that this pot of gold</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was, itself, obtained through a fraud against the Nigerian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sender frequently represents himself to be an official of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian government and claims that he and his associates have obtained</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these funds illicitly from the Nigerian government, by over-invoicing a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contract, by embezzling money from government accounts, or otherwise. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">return for the recipient's assistance with identifying bank accounts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outside Nigeria into which the money can be deposited, the recipient is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">promised a percentage of the funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many recipients throw these letters away, or provide them to law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enforcement or other organizations without responding. U.S. law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enforcement officials have obtained tens of thousands of these letters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from victims and potential victims; although we believe that we see only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a small portion of the total number sent to this country, each of these</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">letters follows a common pattern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the recipient responds to the solicitation letter, he will be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">asked to send money to his new Nigerian confederates to &quot;facilitate&quot; the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">promised transfer to his bank account. The Nigerian con man generally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">represents that the promised funds are being held in the Central Bank of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, and that, prior to receiving the transfer, the victim must</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advance funds to the con man and his associates to satisfy certain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">requirements including paying: Nigerian taxes, bank transfer fees, fees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for purportedly required documents such as &quot;certificates of completion,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">payments to subcontractors, &quot;non-refundable transfer fees,&quot; or bribes to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian officials. In fact, these &quot;requirements&quot; are entirely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fictitious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the official-looking receipts and certificates provided by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fraudsters, there are no funds, embezzled or otherwise fraudulently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obtained from the Nigerian government, as represented to the victim by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fraudsters. All the money provided by the victim goes into the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pockets of the Nigerian con men and their associates. Moreover, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fraudsters are persistent. Once the victim sends the first wire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transfer, the fraudsters will request more money for additional,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fictitious &quot;fees&quot; or &quot;charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the victim provides these funds, he may be contacted by what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appears to be another organization, frequently located in the United</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States, which claims to be a &quot;clearing house&quot; for the Central Bank of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria -- the representatives of which will request the victim to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provide additional funds to complete the transfer. These &quot;clearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">houses&quot; are just another step in the fraud scheme. They are operated by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a confederate of the original con man who will attempt to further</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">defraud the victim by directing the victim to transfer additional funds,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in order to receive the transfer as promised by the first Nigerian con</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of all these contacts and transfers, the victim -- who may</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have been led to believe that he was participating in a dubious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enterprise -- has been defrauded of a great deal of his own money, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has received nothing in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. PROBLEMS FOR U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT DEALING WITH WHITE COLLAR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRIMES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although law enforcement personnel in the United States have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obtained, reviewed and entered into various databases tens of thousands</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of these advance fee fraud letters, at this time we have no way to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">determine the true number of these letters that enter the United States,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nor do we have any solid data concerning the total losses attributable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to these schemes. Some letters are stopped at the border by the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Postal Service and never reach their intended victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many more enter the United States by facsimile, and some may be sent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from third countries, to avoid detection. We have found, for instance,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that arrests of Nigerian advance fee fraud offenders or their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confederates have resulted in seizures of bundles of sealed, pre-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">addressed letters carrying U.S. postage, which were bound for victims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outside the United States. We believe that the same bundling system is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being used to transport letters into the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As difficult as it is to determine the true number of solicitation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">letters entering the United States, it is almost equally difficult to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ascertain the number of actual victims of these schemes. Often, victims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are too ashamed or too frightened to come forward -- either because they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">believe that they were actually participating in a scheme to defraud the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian government, or because they have been threatened by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fraudsters. In some instances, despite their losses, victims may refuse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to believe that they have been defrauded. Based on interviews conducted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by law enforcement personnel, particularly by the Secret Service in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">connection with the Nigerian advance fee fraud database and hotline they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have established, we believe that a number of individuals have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">experienced significant losses. Information obtained to date indicates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that individual losses range from a low of approximately $10,000 to well</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">over $4-5 million per victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those cases that are brought to the government's attention can be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">extremely difficult to investigate and prosecute. Even in cases where</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the victims are willing to cooperate, the perpetrators frequently are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">located in Nigeria, and often employ multiple fictitious identities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although we can indict the defendants under the names they used to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">defraud the victims, discovering whether they have committed any prior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">offenses, obtaining their financial records, or attempting to secure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their extradition from any country is difficult without more accurate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">identification. Moreover, it is difficult for us to control our borders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where defendants travel freely under false identities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the simplicity of these schemes, the perpetrators of these</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">offenses are not unsophisticated criminals. They generally require their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">victims to send funds to bank accounts abroad, or to U.S. accounts from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which the offenders then transfer money to other accounts outside the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Although the United States has treaties and legal assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relationships with many foreign jurisdictions, by the time prosecutors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can make official requests for legal assistance to obtain evidence that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would be admissible in a U.S. court, the money has been wire transferred</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">out of the bank into which the victim transferred it, and law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enforcement personnel must attempt to chase the funds from country to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laundering of these funds presents further problems for law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enforcement. In many instances, the victims are directed to transfer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">funds to accounts which are held by individuals or entities other than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fraudsters who have been in direct contact with the victim and who,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">therefore, have no apparent relationship to the fraud scheme. Moreover,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fraudsters may receive their expected portion of the fraud proceeds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from sources other than the accounts into which the victims made their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deposits, making it very difficult for investigators to follow the money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volume of transfers into and out of these accounts is staggering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over $29 million was transferred into and out of one account in a single</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year. Other accounts examined by law enforcement personnel are also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">highly active. While a thorough analysis of such accounts can yield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">useful evidence and intelligence for law enforcement purposes, obtaining</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these records and performing detailed analyses of these accounts is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time-consuming and resource-intensive project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have further discovered that Nigerian criminal enterprises have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">developed sophisticated systems for laundering the proceeds of these and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other offenses. Essentially, these individuals have devised a method</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whereby they &quot;de-link&quot; the deposit of the proceeds of the fraud scheme</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the laundering of the funds. The victim is instructed to transfer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">funds -- the fraud proceeds -- into a financial institution in one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country, and the fraudster receives a credit with the money launderer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who advises an associate in Nigeria or elsewhere that he should provide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">someone designated by the fraudster with the amount of the credit, less</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the launderer's fee. This mechanism of offsetting credits in one country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against debits in another results in an untraceable -- and very</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">effective -- worldwide money laundering system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even where we are able to obtain foreign bank records and build a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">substantial fraud and money laundering case by tracing the funds, by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time that this has been accomplished, the account has been closed and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the money is gone. Thus, we are frequently unable to recover the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">victim's lost money, and, because the Nigerian perpetrators may not have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">assets in the United States, we may be unable to successfully obtain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">restitution for the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to these difficulties -- which are often inherent in many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigations of transnational financial crimes -- there are certain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unique problems involved in prosecuting these particular fraud schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the Nigerian government has never extradited to the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any individual charged with committing a financial crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past four years, pursuant to U.S. extradition requests,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has arrested eight drug traffickers. Nigeria subsequently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expelled them into U.S. custody by executive fiat rather than through</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the formal extradition process. In December 1995, however, nine other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fugitives who had been arrested for extradition to the U.S. were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">summarily released from custody; only one of the fugitives was required</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to post bail. In short, Nigeria's response to U.S. extradition requests</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been very uneven and unreliable. Nor, despite recent pronouncements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the Nigerian government that it has begun its own law enforcement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">initiatives, have Nigerians been prosecuted for advance fee fraud or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">related money laundering offenses in Nigeria. Thus, Nigerians who commit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these offenses can operate in their own country with relative impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to establish a baseline of normal business activity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against which the Nigerian frauds can be examined. Although it has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enormous resources, Nigeria lacks a well-developed infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming the will to cooperate, simple undertakings, like obtaining</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reliable identification records for an individual or bank records, can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be extremely difficult. Nigerian government and business records, such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as birth certificates, identification documents and financial records,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are often of questionable authenticity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one memorable episode of the investigative television program &quot;60</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes&quot; concerning fraud in Nigeria, Mr. Mike Wallace obtained a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian birth certificate and passport that showed him to be a young</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian-born farmer. Such pervasive, low-level corruption within</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian governmental entities contributes to an overall environment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that permits fraud to flourish, virtually unpunished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the lack of basic functioning governmental institutions, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more active form of corruption exists. At various levels, advance fee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fraud has permeated the few functioning institutions in Nigeria,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including the Central Bank of Nigeria. Victims who contact the Central</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of Nigeria at its main telephone number may later learn that their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">telephone calls have been transferred either to fraudsters operating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inside the Central Bank, or have been diverted from the Bank to outside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exchanges which are being used by the schemers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. SUCCESSFUL WHITE COLLAR CRIME PROSECUTIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has had some recent successes in prosecuting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these types of cases. For instance, in April 1995, a Nigerian individual</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was convicted in Virginia of defrauding a U.S. businessman of over $4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million in an advance fee fraud scheme. The defendant in that case was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sentenced to serve 51 months in prison, to pay $600,000 in restitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the victim, and to pay a $15,000 fine. The Department of Justice was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">able to successfully prosecute that case because we received timely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cooperation by law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Switzerland, including the defendant's arrest by the Swiss police. Two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">additional defendants are believed to be in Nigeria, and the Department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Justice has made unsuccessful requests to the Nigerian government for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their arrest and extradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a similar case last year, two men -- one a Nigerian and the other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a U.S. citizen -- were convicted in Oklahoma City of defrauding a German</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">citizen of over $1 million, over $300,000 of which was deposited into an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oklahoma City bank. The Nigerian, who had previously been convicted of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">another fraud offense, received a sentence of 48 months imprisonment,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the American received a sentence of 18 months imprisonment. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government was also able to recover a portion of the $300,000 loss</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through an administrative seizure by the IRS. In another case prosecuted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Virginia in 1996, a Nigerian national was convicted of defrauding a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">citizen of Guam of over $1 million in an advance fee fraud scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar cases are being prosecuted by other U.S. Attorneys' Offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. DRUG TRAFFICKING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the white collar crime problem involving Nigeria,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria is a major transit country for heroin from Asia and cocaine from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South America. Initially, the heroin source countries were in Southwest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asia; today, they are mainly countries located in Southeast Asia. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">addition to being a transit country, many Nigerians are also involved in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. HEROIN TRAFFICKING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the mid-1980s, over one thousand Nigerian nationals have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">caught and convicted of smuggling heroin into the United States. These</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">smugglers, also known as &quot;bearers,&quot; are mostly females who hide the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heroin in their clothing, luggage or body cavities. Most sources agree</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that only a fraction of the couriers are actually detected and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apprehended. When they are arrested, the bearers usually choose not to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cooperate with U.S. law enforcement. Instead, they plead guilty, serve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their time, and are subsequently deported to Nigeria. This lack of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cooperation makes it difficult for U.S. law enforcement to identify and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pursue the heads of the drug-trafficking operations, who remain safely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian crime rings control important portions of heroin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distribution in Baltimore and other cities in the Eastern portion of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States, and are responsible for about half of all the heroin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">smuggled into the United States. For example, prosecutors in Washington</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D.C. estimate that Nigerians control two-thirds of the heroin in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington-Baltimore area. Seizures of heroin from Nigerian couriers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have been increasing dramatically each year, and are now the most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">significant smuggling problem at JFK International Airport in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. COCAINE TRAFFICKING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian criminal organizations are now expanding into the cocaine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trade. Cocaine destined for Western Europe is transported from Peru and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colombia through Brazil. These organizations are quickly developing ties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with Colombian drug syndicates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. NIGERIA'S DRUG LAWS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its severe drug-trafficking problems, Nigeria has made little</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">effort to address the problem. Nigeria adopted a comprehensive anti-drug</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plan in 1995, but has not funded it adequately for it to be useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria also passed a money laundering law in 1995, which has permitted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some arrests, but as yet no convictions. Nigeria's minimal efforts in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1995 to address its drug trafficking and money laundering problems led</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to its de-certification in March 1996, for the third consecutive year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Full certification was granted from 1987 to 1993.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brightest spot in the Nigerian anti-drug effort is the National</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), led by Major General Musa Bamayi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NDLEA has tried to move beyond the pursuit and arrest of couriers to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the pursuit and, hopefully arrest, of the leaders of Nigeria's drug-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trafficking organizations -- a move encouraged by U.S. authorities. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NDLEA has made some efforts to address the problem of corruption in its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ranks, yet corruption, which is endemic throughout the Nigerian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government, remains a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE NIGERIAN CRIME PROBLEMS:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice has been attempting to combat the Nigerian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crime problem by actively investigating and prosecuting Nigerians</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involved in white collar crime and drug trafficking activities. In the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">white collar crime area, the Department of Justice has also been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attempting to bring (about) an enhanced awareness (of) Nigerian white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collar crime, especially advance fee frauds, by publicizing the issue in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an effort to deter potential victims from agreeing to participate in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">such schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department also has produced a manual for federal prosecutors --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a copy of which I will furnish to this Committee -- outlining strategies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for investigating and prosecuting these types of offenses. This manual</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is being made available to prosecutors via the &quot;USA Book,&quot; an electronic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">database resource for federal prosecutors that will be accessible from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">each of the personal computers linked to the Department of Justice's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">internal network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the drug trafficking area, the Department of Justice, working with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the State Department, has been involved in the de-certification of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria for the third consecutive year. The Department of Justice,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through the State Department, has told Nigeria that in order to be re-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">certified, Nigeria must: (1) devise a drug control strategy and a budget</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to implement it; (2) safeguard intelligence and evidence regarding major</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drug traffickers; (3) expedite pending extradition requests; and (4)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">move against narcotics-related corruption by senior officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department will continue to investigate and prosecute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these cases vigorously and we will continue to cooperate with foreign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">law enforcement personnel to ensure that advance fee fraudsters will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">find no safe haven from which to perpetrate these schemes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is a presentation by Sally Miller, director</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the Office of Africa in the U.S. Commerce Department's International</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade Administration, in testimony September 11 before the Subcommittee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Africa in the U.S. House of Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the Department of Commerce, I would like to thank the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairperson and the members of the Subcommittee for this opportunity to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">testify on Nigerian White Collar Crime and to highlight the efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commerce is taking to prevent U.S. citizens from falling prey to Advance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fee Fraud (419 Fraud) -- named after the relevant section of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian criminal code -- as well as other business scams. We believe it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is extremely important to work continuously to increase awareness about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria is a petroleum-rich West African country of approximately 110</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million people. It offers exporters and investors an extensive labor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pool, abundant natural resources, and the largest domestic market in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is the United States' largest trading</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">partner in this region ($4.8 billion ($4,800 million) in imports,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">principally oil, and $603 million in exports in 1995), and this West</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African country represents the second largest market for U.S. products</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Sub-Saharan Africa. The level of U.S. exports to this market has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">directly paralleled Nigeria's availability of foreign exchange over the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">past several years, falling from a high of nearly $1 billion ($1,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million), down to well under half that figure and this year, recovering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to a potential level of nearly $700 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality remains that the majority of Nigerian businesses are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legitimate. And there are opportunities in Nigeria for savvy firms which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are already established in the market. Leading prospects for U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">businesses include: oil and gas machinery, computers, software and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">peripherals, telecommunications equipment, automotive parts and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accessories, construction equipment, dairy products, wheat, rice, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wine and spirits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When pursuing these opportunities, however, in light of Nigeria's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">challenging business environment, erratic economic policies, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business scam problem, shortage of available foreign exchange, as well</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as the non-availability of U.S. Government export finance, U.S. new-to-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">market firms should enter the arena with caution. We in the Commerce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department are there to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Nigeria does offer business persons potentially profitable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business opportunities, a more than ordinary degree of caution should be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exercised when unsolicited business presents itself. Fraudulent business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proposals, fake letters of credit, and counterfeit checks have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arriving in the United States from Nigeria for at least ten years. Their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frequency, variety, and ingenuity, moreover, have intensified over the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last three or four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraud letters are becoming more sophisticated, thereby making them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all the more convincing. The latest scam proposals feature offers of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">large donations to charities, requests to purchase U.S. real estate,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opportunities to settle unexpected inheritances, and forged tender</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">documents for sizable government contracts. The letters may use names of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">existent companies, ministries, or government contracts; utilize</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">official-looking letterhead; and display an array of &quot;government&quot; seals,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stamps, and signatures to convey a sense of validity to the offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial contact letters may appear quite innocent in their content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, their purpose is to establish a rapport with the targeted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American company or individual in order for a subsequent letter to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appear more credible. When the fraudulent solicitation is eventually</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">introduced, it may comprise more than a simple one-page business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opportunity. The authors of these proposals have crafted an impressive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">array of follow-up letters, supporting documents, and contracts, in an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">effort to convince U.S. firms of the alleged importance and authenticity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the business propositions. This supporting documentation too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frequently allays the skepticism which might normally meet such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ROLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the present situation and the continuing prevalence of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian efforts targeted against U.S. businesses, the Department of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commerce has assumed a proactive role in fighting these fraudulent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business proposals. Commerce has been active on three fronts in this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">effort: 1) aggressive information outreach; 2) on-the-ground support in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos; and 3) participation in interagency efforts. The U.S. Government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continues to seek to engage the Nigerian Government in addressing this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIZE OF THE PROBLEM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, the Department of Commerce Nigeria Desk received</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">approximately 2,500 inquiries about Nigeria-based scams. The vast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">majority of the inquirers to our office did not realize at the time that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the deal they were looking into was an attempt to defraud them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, the number of inquiries had decreased to approximately</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1,300; January through August 1996 figures reveal a further decline in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the number of phone calls and letters received by the Office of Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to about 500. The yearly figure for 1996 will likely be in the range of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">800 inquiries. The Office of Africa currently receives approximately 2-3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">phone calls and/or letters per day from the U.S. business community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">requesting assistance in determining whether a proposal from Nigeria is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legitimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are aware of at least two incidents, one in 1991 and a second in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1995, in which Americans who had unknowingly become involved in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fraudulent business deal traveled to Nigeria and were killed after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refusing to put more money into the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to quantify the costs of the scams to American business is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">very difficult and imprecise. Estimates made by the U.S. Embassy in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos, based largely on the number of scams detected and on reports of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business persons incurring losses, placed the yearly impact at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">considerably more than $250 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INFORMATION OUTREACH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commerce has assumed an active role in assisting U.S. firms through</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">public education, by utilizing media such as business counseling and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">published articles. Callers to the Office frequently comment that they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have read articles warning them about Nigerian business fraud schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having read any of the numerous articles published on Nigerian fraud,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business persons have commented that they are more inclined to call the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department of Commerce-Nigeria Desk to determine the bona fides of an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unsolicited business proposition. We feel that it is extremely important</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to continue publicity on this subject to prevent further losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Office of Africa has sent background information on scams to all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">state International Trade Offices, 150 major trade associations, all of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Commerce Department Export Assistance Centers, and numerous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional offices to aid them in counseling and warning their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constituents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Office of Africa's Nigeria Desk Officers have conducted several</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interviews with the press to further inform the public about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian fraud issue. A listing of those instances is attached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occasions for public speaking opportunities and mass media presentations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were seen as ideal ways to broaden public knowledge about this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most updated information disseminated by Commerce on this problem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is the November 1995 Business America article entitled, &quot;Doing Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Nigeria: Distinguishing Between the Profitable and the Questionable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The published article outlines the latest proposals received by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">companies and provides potential &quot;red flags&quot; of which U.S. companies and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individuals should be aware. The article also provides ways to help</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">determine the legitimacy of a business proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EFFORTS ON THE GROUND IN LAGOS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service in Lagos cooperated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the U.S. Embassy Consular Section in helping to extricate nearly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">100 victims from potentially life-threatening situations in Nigeria,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which initially began as business dealings. In May through August of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this year, the Consular Section helped ten Americans return to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States after their disillusionment with their travel to Lagos and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fruitless efforts to collect money which they too late learned never</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">existed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1994, the Foreign Commercial Service (FCS) at the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embassy in Lagos, Nigeria, created the Automated List Excluding Reliable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traders (ALERT) database as a first line of defense in protecting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American businesses. The most recent data from the ALERT database reveal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that from April 1, 1996, to July 31, 1996, FCS entered 612 new entries,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bringing total listings to 6,256 entries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALERT's purpose is to help distinguish unreliable from reliable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contacts. It is an attempt to organize and automate extensive amounts of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">information (predominantly individual and company names with addresses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and phone numbers) located in several files. The primary component of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the records is the background information contained in files referenced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and found when searching telephone numbers submitted for review. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">database is intended to serve as a helpful tool for obtaining and cross-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">referencing information. The information is verified by retrieving the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relevant file and/or visiting the sites where the documents presumably</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">originated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONGOING EFFORTS AT IDENTIFICATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A U.S. company seeking background on a Nigerian company may request</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an International Company Profile (ICP) on a Nigerian company through any</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Department of Commerce Export Assistance Center. Businesses which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">phone 1-800-USA-TRADE are provided with the number of the EAC nearest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them. The ICP reports offer extensive information on the organization in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">question. However, because numerous scams utilize the names of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legitimate companies or Nigerian Government agencies, it is extremely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crucial to verify both the transaction and the company. It is useful to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contact the U.S. Department of Commerce Nigeria Desk Officer in helping</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to obtain this verification. U.S. firms should know that through prudent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">skepticism, American companies can avoid falling victim to individuals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involved in fraudulent business activities, yet continue to take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advantage of lucrative business opportunities with legitimate Nigerian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTERAGENCY EFFORTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Commerce has worked with the Department of State to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strengthen and expand the business scam portion of the State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department's Travel Advisory/Consular Information Sheet for Nigeria. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">addition, a brochure entitled &quot;Tips for Business Travelers to Nigeria&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was also produced in collaboration with the State Department. I have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">brought copies of each of these documents with me for the Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COOPERATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Interagency Working Group on Nigerian Crime (IWGNC), was formed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in 1993 to &quot;provide coordination, guidance, and specific action items</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which will invoke an increased level of cooperation from the Government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Nigeria (GON), increase interagency lines of communication, enhance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exchange of intelligence, and ultimately decrease incidences of Nigerian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participation in narcotics trafficking, money laundering and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business/financial fraud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Commerce is a member of this working group along</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with Customs, Treasury, Justice, and various units of State, among</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">others. The group convenes monthly to discuss the latest developments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and to determine the next sequence of steps in combating Nigerian White</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collar Crime (specifically 419 Fraud).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Interagency Group has called upon Commerce to &quot;expand existing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">public information programs which assist U.S. companies seeking business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opportunities in Nigeria, help them to recognize scam operations, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provide general travel information precautions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, in conjunction with various units of State and other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IWGNC participants, Commerce will &quot;lead the U.S. efforts to present an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accurate portrayal of Nigerian involvement in criminal activity and its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">impact upon the U.S., while also developing mechanisms whereby the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business community can apply direct pressure to make its concerns and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the commensurate economic consequences known to the Nigerian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meetings were held this summer between officials from the Central</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of Nigeria and U.S. officials regarding ways in which both sides</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could cooperate to fight Nigerian financial crimes. Discussions focused</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on ways for the Central Bank, the Secret Service, and the U.S. Embassy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Lagos to collaborate in an effort to combat 419 Fraud and money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">laundering. Both Nigerian and American officials agreed to share</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">information about Nigerian bank accounts involved in questionable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">activities. More specifically, the Foreign Operations and Bank Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Departments agreed to investigate account numbers given to them by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sources from the United States, and in return, potentially incriminating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">information collected by them would be shared with the appropriate U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently there is a request on behalf of the Nigerian Government for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">training of Central Bank of Nigeria investigators to help them fight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">money laundering. U.S. Government training would focus on the role of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the law enforcement community in analyzing data from banks and building</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legal cases for asset forfeiture. The USG is looking at ways in which it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can be responsive to this request for training without compromising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">security and detection methods utilized in the law enforcement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the arrest earlier this year in Georgia of a Nigerian involved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in international business fraud schemes, Kent Alexander, the United</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia stated that &quot;it's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">just rare for us to be able to prosecute these cases, and this will help</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people to know more about these schemes. I have no doubt that people are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">falling for them because we still have this flood of complaints. When it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">slows to a trickle, then I will believe that it has stopped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our dominant weapon, clearly, in preventing Americans from becoming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">victims of Nigerian scams is public education through business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">counseling and the press. Given the decline in the number of American</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business persons requiring repatriation, we are hopeful that this means</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that U.S. business people are becoming increasingly wiser. We think we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can rightfully take some measure of comfort and credit that the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government's public awareness efforts have contributed in part to this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decline in the number of U.S. businesses falling victim to the scams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The success we may have achieved in this area, however, may in fact mask</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a shift in the targets of the scam artists rather than a true decline in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the problem, as my colleagues in the Secret Service have seen no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decrease in the level of scams being reported to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chairman, our responsibility to the public continues due to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ongoing problem of scams. We firmly believe that stimulating public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">awareness about the issue is the best method possible to keep Americans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from falling victim. We also believe that Nigeria offers a profitable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">market for experienced U.S. companies, and we actively encourage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continued U.S. business relations with firms in Nigeria that are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reputable and legitimate. Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following are the remarks as prepared for delivery by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose to a forum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organized by the Constituency for Africa (CFA), a Washington-based</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organization that promotes closer U.S.-African ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning. I am honored to have this opportunity to address the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inaugural session of the Constituency for Africa's &quot;Ronald H. Brown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Affairs Series.&quot; I had the pleasure of travelling with Secretary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown on three of his five trips to Africa. He was an outstanding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statesman, advancing a vision of Africa not only as a developing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continent, but as a vital, emerging partner in global affairs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he made the Commerce Department an effective instrument for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pursuing American opportunities, Secretary Brown worked tirelessly to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advance the interests of Africa, winning friends and establishing strong</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">partnerships wherever he went. Secretary Brown once said, &quot;Africa is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">important because of the huge potential of its people and its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">economies...and it is important because the great global challenges of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tomorrow can be seen in the challenges facing Africa today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary Brown's simultaneous pursuit of U.S. and African interests</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was an important component of U.S. policy towards Africa during the past</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">four years. The Administration made democracy and human rights the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">centerpiece of our Africa policy not as part of a moral crusade, but in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the pragmatic pursuit of our own national interests and the long-term</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interests of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic governance and respect for basic human rights are key to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's development. Human rights abuses have decreased in countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which have adopted democratic rule. And people who are living free of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">persecution or intimidation, and who have a voice in political</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decisions, are proving a valuable resource in resolving Africa's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of representative government, in Africa as elsewhere,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leads to bad policy making and economic ruin. Without the checks and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">balances provided by independent government institutions, corruption and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">waste can undermine legitimacy and the ability to function, creating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governments which are incapable of governing. Without regular, credible</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elections, individual officials are not ultimately accountable to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building democracy in Africa is critical to advancing U.S. goals and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">objectives in Africa as well. Now more than ever, the United States</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">needs effective partners in solving international threats, such as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">environmental degradation, the spread of disease, international crime,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">narcotics trafficking and terrorism. Democratic governments share our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goals on international issues, and only governments which represent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their people can speak and act with legitimacy and authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the African market is nearly as large as those of the newly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">independent states, including Russia, of the former Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although domestic and foreign investment have been slow to pick up,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary Brown often pointed out that, if the risks of doing business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Africa are higher than in many other places, the rewards, in the form</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of average rates of return, are among the highest in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building democracy in Africa also supports our ongoing efforts in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conflict resolution and prevention. Conflicts in Africa, as elsewhere,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">result more often than not in the absence of democracy, and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exclusion of people or groups of people from effective participation in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decisions which affect their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both Mozambique and Angola, for example, the negotiation of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">framework for democratic participation was key to efforts to resolve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">long-standing political conflict and civil war. The absence of effective</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democratic participation was a key underlying factor in the 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conflict in Rwanda, as it is in the current strife in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, our hopes for preserving democratic gains in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, from South Africa to Mali, depend heavily on our ability to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resolve existing conflicts and prevent the outbreak of new ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise, these conflict situations will destabilize whole regions and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">overwhelm the progress that has already been achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly four years since the Administration took office, experience</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has proven the wisdom and rightness of our decision to put democracy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">building at the center of our Africa policy. Over the past four years we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have invested over $300 million in this effort. But it is important to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understand that it is Africans themselves who are demanding democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impetus for democratic change originates in Africa itself, and it is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that impetus that explains why nearly forty countries have held</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transitional elections over the last seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have also had confirmation that the democratic impulse is deeply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rooted in African tradition. The challenge has been to translate that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">traditional democratic spirit and practice into forms that are workable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a modern nation-state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those forms can and do vary from state to state in Africa, just as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they do in other parts of the world. But there are principles and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">practices of democracy that are essential. That is why so much attention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has focused on elections, because elections provide the essential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mechanism for the orderly transfer of political power in response to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will of the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we have also learned that our focus must extend beyond elections,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the building of independent democratic institutions such as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">parliaments, judiciaries, and the media. We must help Africans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strengthen civil society in order to bring government into closer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proximity to the people. The recent flowering of civil society -- small</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business cooperatives to lawyers' associations -- as well as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governmental reforms, bears testimony to a strong desire for democratic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have learned that the process will take time, precisely because it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involves the building of institutions and the gradual development of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democratic culture. It will be uneven, because different societies are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in differing stages of political development. And there will be setbacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as some seek to thwart or subvert the democratic process. But what is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remarkable is how positive, on balance, the record has been, given the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">challenges and difficulties. That is why it is important that we make a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">long-term commitment, that we be prepared to stay the course and not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lose patience when setbacks do occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have also learned the importance of supporting good democrats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wherever we may find them, especially those that are struggling within</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">environments that are hostile to democratic principles and practices. We</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">must learn to find ways to work with and within societies that are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undemocratic. To turn our backs on the people of such societies would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to impose a double punishment and a double injustice. Supporting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reformers in a difficult environment eventually paid off in places like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Philippines, Poland, and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last but not least, we have learned that progress in building</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democracy cannot be sustained in the absence of improved economic and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">social conditions. Democracy cannot long survive in conditions of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">endemic poverty and deprivation. That is why it is critically important</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that we muster the will to find the resources to support Africa's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">economic development as we support her transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a terrible irony that at a time when Africans are heeding our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advice and counsel on the wisdom of adopting democratic practices, our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">own capacity to support their efforts is being drastically reduced. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States spends less than one-fifth of one percent of its total</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">annual budget on all forms of assistance to Africa -- military,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">humanitarian, and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, our development assistance to Africa is about 25 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lower than last year, and with severe cuts in operating expenses, USAID</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will have fewer staff for overseas posts. Ron Brown fully understood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that trade and investment are essential to Africa's future growth and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development. But trade and investment are not substitutes for targeted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major transformation is taking place across the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. can be proud of the role it has played in encouraging and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supporting that transformation. In 1989 there were only five democracies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Africa. Today, there are twenty-three democracies and nearly twenty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other countries have instituted key democratic reforms. Conflicts have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been resolved in Ethiopia, Uganda, Namibia, South Africa, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambique. Peace processes are under way in Angola and Liberia. Those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries which have adopted economic reforms are beginning to see</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">positive results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the outcome is still in the balance. Ultimate success will depend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on our will and commitment, and on our ability to mobilize the resources</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">necessary to sustain Africa's historic transition. As Ron Brown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understood clearly, success will bring enormous benefits to the United</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States. Failure would bring tragic consequences for us all. We must not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allow that to happen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - (Sept. 12, 1996) In a letter to President Omar Hassan al</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bashir, Human Rights Watch today protests the ongoing secret trial, held</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at army headquarters, of thirty-one persons accused of crimes that carry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the death penalty, citing allegations that the defendants had been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tortured into making confessions. Human Rights Watch is calling for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exclusion of all such statements from evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch, which opposes the death penalty, has asked to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">send observers to this trial of Col. Awad al Karim Omar Ibrahim Elnagar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and others. The thirty-one defendants are accused of waging war on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">state and mutiny in violation of civilian and military codes, although</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two defendants are civilians, one of whom is a television cameraman. The</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">letter is attached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report released in May 1996, Behind the Red Line: Political</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repression in Sudan, Human Rights Watch criticized the execution, after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a secret and hasty military hearing conducted without proper judicial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">safeguards, of twenty-eight military officers said to have attempted a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">coup in 1990. To date, that secrecy has been unjustly preserved: their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bodies have not been turned over to their relatives nor has the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government made the proceedings public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of the letter dated September 12, 1996 to Omar Hassan al Bashir,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">president of the Republic of Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa met with the Ambassador from the Republic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Sudan to Washington in June and gave him a dozen copies of our May</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">report, Behind the Red Line: Political Repression in Sudan, for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distribution to government officials. We also provided a list of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government officials with whom we met during our mission to Khartoum in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May and June 1995. Ambassador Mahdi Ibrahim Mohamed invited us to return</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Sudan to discuss the report and other issues with the appropriate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have learned that there is now a secret trial underway in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum against thirty-one persons accused of violations of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal Code of 1991 and the People's Armed Forces Act 1406 (1986).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This trial, referred to as the trial of Col. Awad al Karim Omar Ibrahim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elnagar and others, began in late August. It is being held in camera in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the military intelligence school at army headquarters in Khartoum with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">three military officers as judges, only one of whom is said to be a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">qualified lawyer, who is a member of the Military Justice Corps. No</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">observers are being permitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants, detained in February 1996 but not charged with any</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crime until August 1996, are alleged to have been involved in a coup</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attempt. The crimes with which they are charged, waging war against the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">state and mutiny, carry the death penalty. Human Rights Watch opposes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the death penalty.  We have received reports that some of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thirty one defendants are retired army personnel, including one retired</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General (Babiker Khalifa Jalli) and some retired noncommissioned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officers. There are also four civilians who were never officers, two of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whom are Ossama Ghandi (a television cameraman and photographer) and Haj</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed (a building site guard). We question the appropriateness of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">using a military tribunal to try former military officers and civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The occupation of the cameraman gives rise to the question of whether</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his arrest and trial might be related to his professional duties and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constitute an abridgement of freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the defendants were reportedly tortured and coerced into signing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confessions. Such statements should not be used in evidence against the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">defendants; to do so would be a grave violation of their rights. While</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the defendants have been permitted to be represented by advocates of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their choice, we are concerned that due process is not being observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We expressed our interest to Ambassador Mahdi Ibrahim Mohamed in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being permitted to attend, as trial observers, any such trials that were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">held in Sudan. We hereby request permission to attend this trial. While</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Sudan, we would greatly appreciate the opportunity to interview the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">eleven military officers alleged by the Democratic Unionist Party in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cairo to have been summarily executed on August 18, 1996, and said by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">your government to be alive and well. The executed officers are said to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">include Maj. al Dardiri Haj Ahmad, Maj. Salah Karboni, Lt. Col. Ali</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbas Ali, Lt. Col. Mohamed Mahmud, and Maj. Taj al Sir Sarbil, among</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We understand that these officers are part of a group of alleged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">coup plotters in custody since July and August 1996, referred to as the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Port Sudan group and consisting of some twenty-one military personnel,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the highest-ranking said to be Col. Gamal Yusuf and Lt. Col. Ali Abbas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali (the latter said by the opposition to have been executed). If they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have not yet been tried, and if your government is to try them, we would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">like to send observers to that trial as well. If they have been tried,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we would appreciate the opportunity to interview those who are still in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">custody, as well as the judges and prosecutors involved in the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We welcome this opportunity to visit Khartoum to follow up as well on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">issues raised in our report Behind the Red Line. For instance, we have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been told that Maj. Abd al Hifiz Ahmed al Bashir of Sudan security,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accused of the checkpoint killing of engineer Abu Bakr Mohy al Din</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rasikh and of the torture of the defendants in the &quot;Explosives Case,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been cleared of all responsibility and promoted. In addition, we are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially interested in receiving a copy of the report on slavery that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">your government was to issue in mid-August 1996, and to follow up on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">slavery issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We want to continue to remain in dialog with your government,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially those officials in Khartoum whose duties touch on human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rights concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for your attention to these important issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - To consolidate and extend the significant economic and political gains that have been achieved in Africa over the past five years, the continent's reform process requires greater commitment by both African governments and the international community, says Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new report on the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, the Secretary-General notes a marked improvement in Africa's economic performance over the first half of the decade. In 1995, he reports, 12 African countries registered a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 6 per cent or more, while in 1992 only three countries had reached that level. Although citing this and other &quot;signs of tangible progress&quot;, the Secretary-General also points to shortcomings, including a stagnation in external aid to Africa, with net flows of official development assistance to the continent declining from $25 billion in 1992 to $23 billion in 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was prepared for the General Assembly's Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole, which will conduct a week-long review of the implementation of the new Agenda, beginning on 16 September. The review will hear assessments of the efforts made to meet the objectives of the New Agenda by African countries and by the international community. It will also hear proposals for enhancing the New Agenda's implementation over the next half decade. The views of governments, non-governmental organizations, multilateral institutions and regional bodies such as the Organization of African Unity will be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this critical point,&quot; the Secretary-General's report says, the international community should &quot;accelerate its support to these countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development&quot; . In particular, he argues, the international community must improve the level and scope of aid and take &quot;additional and decisive measures&quot; to resolve Africa's debt crisis. It also must take concrete steps to help African countries adjust to the new global market environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the particularly difficult development challenges facing the African continent, the New Agenda was adopted by the General Assembly in December 1991 as a framework of consensus and partnership between Africa and the international community. It outlined complementary actions to be taken by both African countries and their international partners in the 1990s, in order to meet priority development objectives. African countries agreed to intensify efforts in such areas as economic management, regional cooperation, democratization, investment promotion, social services, agriculture, environment and population. The continent's external partners pledged to reinforce those efforts with the necessary financial and technical support, especially through higher net resource flows including deeper debt relief, and improved market access for African exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ad Hoc Committee of the whole was established by Assembly resolution 42/163 as a mechanism to review the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs of Progress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report on the New Agenda implementation, the Secretary-General finds that &quot;the great majority of African countries have consistently taken appropriate actions to achieve sustained and sustainable growth and development.&quot; Those actions include a range of political and economic reforms which have brought signs of progress:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- In addition to an increased number of African countries with GDP growth rates of 6 per cent or higher, the number with negative growth dropped from 19 in 1993 to three in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- A growing commitment to regional and sub-regional economic cooperation and integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Marked progress in democratic and constitutional reform, with a dramatic growth in multi-party elections and intensified efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts. Non-governmental organizations also have increased their role in national development programmes, emphasizing community participation and self-help efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Greater promotion of the domestic and foreign private sector in economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Reforms to boost agriculture and improve access to food by the poorest groups, as well as programmes to safeguard the environment and address population issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critical Issues for Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General devotes a significant portion of his report to a series of recommendations to both Africa and the international community, with the aim of enhancing the implementation of the New Agenda over the next five years. The primary responsibility, he affirms, rests with Africa, and the continent's leaders must acknowledge that &quot;Africa's future is in their hands&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To consolidate the democratization process and improve governance in Africa, the Secretary-General recommends that African countries provide for wider popular participation in decision-making, encourage the emergence of a strong and vibrant civil society, ensure the independence of the media and adhere to the rule of law with an objective judicial system. They should also create mechanisms to promote political stability and to prevent or resolve conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to capacity-building, African countries need to improve health care systems, intensify efforts towards universal primary education and literacy, integrate population policies into their development strategies, address problems of unemployment and empower women to participate fully in the development process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On domestic resource mobilization, the Secretary-General suggests that measures should be taken to improve taxation, control public expenditures, increase private savings and attract domestic and foreign investment. And to raise the continent's earnings, African economies need to boost external trade and diversify away from dependence on a limited number of primary commodities. Efforts should also be made to strengthen African regional and sub-regional institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that the New Agenda for Africa emphasizes the principles of &quot;shared responsibility and full partnership&quot; between Africa and the international community, the Secretary-General also highlights a number of areas in which the continent's development partners should reinforce their support for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first half of the New Agenda period, financial flows to Africa had &quot;stagnated at a level below what was expected&quot;, the Secretary-General observes. But there is a &quot;strong case&quot; for increasing both the volume and the concessionality of development assistance to Africa, he argues, given that the economic difficulties of many African countries make access to private funding impossible. In addition, the Secretary-General suggests, donors should re-channel aid to Africa's key development priorities, switch to non- debt creating forms of assistance, link humanitarian and development assistance and better coordinate their various aid programmes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there has been some progress in resolving the international debt crisis, the Secretary-General notes, this has been less marked for low-income countries, especially in Africa, where external debt servicing claims nearly one fifth of average savings. He recommends that commercial banks be encouraged to accept deeper discounts in buy-back operations and that more resources be provided to the World Bank's debt-reduction facility for low- income countries. The Paris Club of official creditors should be encouraged to improve its terms for reducing official bilateral debt, while the World Bank and International Monetary Fund should be encouraged to implement recent proposals on relief of multilateral debt, which now accounts for nearly half of Africa's debt servicing obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Uruguay Round agreements on international trade offer long-term possibilities for African products to gain greater access to world markets, says the Secretary-General, but in the short term they may have negative effects as African countries lose their trade preferences in European markets and face higher food import bills. He therefore urges support for appropriate compensation, including further tariff reductions on African products, as well as assistance with food imports. In addition, the Secretary-General urges donor countries to help finance the preparatory phase of commodity diversification programmes in African countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Sexual abuse of minors or children is a growing problem worldwide.  In Kenya and Uganda newspapers carry reports on sexual defilement of children nearly on a daily basis. However, increasing social awareness of the problem may help curb this vice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the main criticisms of the recently concluded International Congress on the Sexual Exploitation of Children held in Stockholm, Sweden from August 26 to 30, was that it emphasized commercial exploitation yet in many countries worldwide sexual abuse of children occurs without any money changing hands. Government, and communities worldwide are seeking solutions to this growing vice that often leaves children ruined for the rest of their lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example late August, tough new legislation was passed in the American State of California. The Bill passed by State Assembly requires that any man convicted of two sex attacks on minors or children submit to either physical castration (surgical-which is permanent) or to what is called &quot;chemical castration&quot; which is effected with regular injections of the drug depo- provera. This drug is regularly used by women in family planning but in men it causes a loss of sex drive which is reversed when the injections are stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if depo-provera administration turns out to be effective in reducing the incidence of repeat sex attacks, such solutions may be difficult to manage and supervise in Third World nations like Uganda where extra-mural penal institutions - punishment outside of prison in the form of community penance of one kind or another - are very poorly developed or non-existent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem of child defilement is still rampant in Uganda despite the fact that both rape and defilement of minors are capital offences. In this East African country, the law treats anybody below 18 years as a minor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An overwhelming fact that emerges in studies of sex abuse of children in Uganda is that relatives, neighbours and acquaintances are most to blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One study has shown that between 20,000 and 30,000 adults living in Kampala were victims of sex abuse in childhood. Kampala has a daytime population of 1 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent research done by the Glad Tidings Bible College Counselling Centre at Makerere, Kampala, emphasises that most of the victims have been sexually abused by acquaintances, and relatives including fathers, step-fathers, uncles, brothers, cousins, trusted family friends and neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These findings are similar to a completely unrelated earlier survey carried out by the New Vision, a state-owned daily. The newspaper gave a breakdown of the relationship of the child defiler (offender) to the child victim based on 190 newspaper reports on sex crimes that were published from 1992 to 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results were as follows: neighbour, 33 per cent; teacher, 9 per cent; relationship not stated, 33 per cent; complete stranger, 12 per cent; pastor, 3 per cent; father, 3 per cent; brother, 3 per cent and cousin 3 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the recent study by Glad Tidings Bible College Counselling Centre, the victims suffer long term damage that is carried into adulthood with repercussions such as feeding and sleeping disturbances, feelings of guilt, shame, lack of self appreciation, anxiety, and hidden anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis Olwenyi Auto, Maxine Hancock and Karen Burton Mains who did the study, point out that far too many people tend to believe that child sexual abuse does not happen, thus permitting it to continue unabated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dennis Olweny Auto, one of the researchers in the current study, most of the people who seek counselling at the Glad Tidings counselling centre at Makerere are suffering extreme guilt and show other deep seated emotions like hatred. They have tried everything to get rid of these feelings, including witchcraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A typical victim of sexual abuse in childhood is generally withdrawn from other people and many develop behavioural disorders including repetitive compulsive actions. This may take the form of repetitive washing of hands or some abnormal preoccupation with cleanliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Auto was quoted by a section of the press in Uganda saying that &quot;many victims feel dirty and are often obsessive about neatness.&quot; A woman may unconsciously become obese because being overweight may make her less attractive. This may be an unconscious signal that she does not wish to engage in sexual activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One woman is quoted saying: &quot;When I was 15, I was raped by my step- father and had a child by him. I kept telling him it was wrong, he said it was not, as he was not a blood relation of mine. My mother went to the grave blaming me, but she ought to have known better as my step-father was 40 years older than I.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Auto emphasizes that no child has sufficient understanding or grasp of the situation to be sexually responsible. &quot;The craving for love and attention that renders a child vulnerable is the result of a natural instinct to trust adults,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, one of Uganda's leading crusaders against child defilement has come up with a 10-point plan to help parents, children and the society in general reduce the incidence of child defilement in Uganda or cope with its aftermath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Points stressed by Ms. Alleluya Ikote, a Member of Parliament representing women of Pallisa District in Eastern Uganda include; To sensitize children not to go alone or agree to be lured by someone to secluded places; That adults-even relatives-fondling their private parts is wrong; Under no circumstances should pupils go to teachers' houses; Policies should be put in place at all levels to strengthen the family unit by ensuring that families are not fragmented; Ensure that there is a welcoming, effective place and organized system where a child can take complaints so that she/he is totally not afraid of victimization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the German city of Cologne where child defilement is reported to be on the increase, a psychologist on the police hotline advises parents not to force their child to hug a stranger or relative if he or she does not want to.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Only three years since taking office in democratic elections that ousted long-time Marxist ruler Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, President Albert Zafy has himself been forced out of office after the Malagasy Constitutional Court upheld his impeachment by the national assembly last July. But he vows he will run for this country's presidency in the forthcoming elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political turmoil continues to dog the Indian Ocean island republic of Madagascar off the East African coast following the forcing out of office on September 5 of the country's President Albert Zafy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court officially announced its decision to uphold the national assembly's impeachment on September 5, but only after Zafy had himself earlier gone on the national radio to announce that he would step down on October 10.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court named 58-year-old Prime Minister Norbert Ratsirahonana, who is also accused by his critics of precipitating the crisis, as interim head of state. The new head of state was himself previously head of the constitutional court, before being named premier in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zafy was finally relieved of his office by Madagascar's Constitutional Court, which upheld his impeachment by the national assembly in July, after a long constitutional battle starting several months earlier that also forced the country's then prime minister Emmanuel Rakotovahiny to resign in May following his failure to dispel the government's unpopularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputies had accused Zafy, who was elected three years ago with a large majority, of violating the constitution by failing to set up the Senate, or upper house of parliament, and reorganize the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zafy, 69, a former professor of medicine and Health Minister who led the Vital Forces Movement that forced Ratsiraka to bow to democracy in 1991, was a key figure in the pro-democracy movement that eventually ended his 17-year rule in February, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once elected to the presidency with diminished powers, Zafy had pledged to be the guardian of the new constitution of Madagascar's Third Republic, but the considerable initial enthusiasm that followed the political changes gave way to increasing concern over the depression in the country, amid reports of food shortages and other economic and social problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political pundits had immediately believed that the new developments could trigger yet another long constitutional battle, this time between the constitutional court and the national assembly, currently sitting in special session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some political analysts contested the authority of the constitutional court to appoint an interim president, noting that Zafy had announced his own &quot; virtual resignation&quot; before the official announcement by the court, which gave him a chance to stand for re-election in an election which will have to be held now following the constitutional court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move also meant that national assembly speaker Pastor Richard Andriamanjato was also entitled by the constitution to stake a claim for the interim presidency, but this has since failed to materialize after Andriamanjato decided during a special parliamentary session later on September 5 to endorse the court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Malagasy journalist had maintained that &quot;legally, everything would depend on establishing which came first: the high court's decision or Zafy's virtual resignation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 26, 99 of the 138 members of the national assembly, or lower house of parliament, voted for Zafy's impeachment. Two months earlier, Rakotovahiny resigned as premier after his government received a no-confidence vote in the national assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court's decision was widely seen as punishing the once highly popular Zafy for failing to meet the high hopes of the Malagasy people when they swept him into power after his &quot;quiet revolution&quot; against long-time ruler Admiral Didier Ratsiraka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 58-year-old prime minister, who once presided over the constitutional court that designated him as interim head of state, belongs to no political party and was entrusted by Zafy with the task of getting Madagascar's economy back into shape. He has already occupied several senior administrative posts.  Ratsirahonana is seen as a master of the political game after he managed to marginalize Zafy, a move that will put few obstacles in his way as the fight to try and bring back Madagascar on the rails intensifies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ratsirahonana immediately said after the court's ruling that priority plans will be to go to Washington to sign financial agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes that this was the priority that others before him had failed to see, particularly his predecessor who was forced out of office following a no- confidence vote against his government due to economic disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last April, the IMF Director-General Michel Camdessus spent three days in the island republic for talks with political leaders on Madagascar's dire financial straits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the visit, Camdessus called for a range of reforms including monetary discipline, the opening of international trade, a campaign against corruption as well as programmes for health and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMF and World Bank agreements with Madagascar were suspended in 1991 because of the poor state of the country's economy, and the situation had not improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ratsirahonana, who has made the re-establishment of negotiations with global financial institutions a priority since his appointment in May, has already signed a &quot;letter of intent&quot; with the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our commitment to reach agreement with the institutions of Bretton Woods (the conference which founded the World Bank) is dictated by the deep conviction that only such accords and structural adjustments will help us out of this rut,&quot; Ratsirahonana declared recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one man who must be wondering whither goes Madagascar since he was ousted from power three years ago is former President Ratsiraka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting from Paris to developments at home, Ratsiraka who was forced to bow to democracy in 1991 and allowed multipartyism to take root in the Indian Ocean island, said he considered that the latest developments in his home country were &quot;dangerous and explosive&quot; since they were &quot;completely illegal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ratsiraka, who has lived in France for the last 17 months, criticised what he described as a government &quot;founded in insurrection, on the streets, which has given birth to a monstrous constitutional bastard riddled with contradictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current constitution was drawn up against my person, to prevent my eventual return, and not for Madagascar, which means that the presidential role was deprived of all its substance to give all power to the prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now all this has boomeranged back&quot; at the current leaders, he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Traditions play an important role in the way people relate to nature. An international environmental agency recently organised activities that highlighted the role of African traditions in preserving the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Important plants and animal species face the risk of becoming extinct as a result of fast and progressive removal from their habitat. Forests disappear, deserts spread and millions of tonnes of top soil end up in oceans every year as over-population leads to desperate efforts for survival which eventually end up destroying the environment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Africa, environmentalists are concerned about the preservation of African traditions that help guard against environmental degradation. They are seeking a return to old traditions whose observance in the past often reminded people of their obligation to nature and fellow human beings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in this respect that organisers of a week-long workshop, 'Festival of the Living Traditions: 'Old Ways to the Future', set aside a day to honour and &quot;cleanse&quot; Mt. Kenya, Kenya's highest mountain (17,058 feet) and Africa's second highest after Mt. Kilimanjaro in neighbouring Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the workshop that ran from September 2 to 8, 1996, elders from around Mt. Kenya and from Uganda's governing clans on August 31 held a cleansing ceremony on the mountain. The workshop and mountain spiritual cleansing events were organised by the Nairobi-based Environment Liaison Centre International (ELCI) and sponsored by the Ford Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Festival explored sustainable ways of living throughout East Africa by linking traditional knowledge and modern technology. The ways of living were demonstrated through lively and practical exhibitions, cultural performances and public fora, all of which served as a means to highlight the value of Africa's threatened traditions and make clear their role in the future. The festival complemented the Fifth International Congress of Ethnobiology that was also held at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mt. Kenya cleansing ceremony was presided over by a Meru traditional high priest, Mr. Stanley Airagua, who donned a traditional outfit that constituted an animal skin coat, white and black headgear made from a columbus monkey skin and a narrow band of a ram's skin tied around his forehead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fly whisk, the traditional three-legged stool, a gourd holding some herbal concoction mixed with honey and two calabashes formed part of the high priest's tools of trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he led the procession towards the cleansing site, he took some of the mixture in his mouth, sprinkling it in all directions. On nearing the shrine, women were asked to stay away as tradition bars them from entering the sacred site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken by surprise, some white ladies who had travelled to Mt. Kenya to witness the ceremony reluctantly obliged to this demand as they felt they were not bound by any African culture. In fact it took one of the organisers to explain to a lady sent by the Ford Foundation that the ceremony would not begin without them leaving the scene as demanded. With no option, the bewildered visitor left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men were then asked to encircle the shrine but were not allowed to set foot in the inner circle which is regarded as the holiest place, reserved only for the high priest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A most peculiar process of the cleansing ceremony which was attended by about 50 people including journalists, was the manner in which the ram was killed. Not supposed to make any noise, the animal was strangled and died of suffocation. A mockery of good stewardship and care for the dying animal was done by the presiding traditional priest. To symbolize the grazing of the animal, a blade of grass was put in its mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the ram was confirmed dead, a knife sharpened on a small stone fetched from the peak of the mountain was used to slit its throat. Then the high priest took blood collected in two calabashes down the stream, and facing the mountain, raised them in supplication as further sacrifice to the gods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was not all. The high priest then disappeared into a secluded part of the forest, warning that no one should follow him. Even the curious journalists who kept tab on the ceremony's proceedings were no exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to this final event in the Marania Forest at the slopes of Mt. Kenya, some elders and selected youth who will succeed the incumbent elders, had climbed up to the mountain peak where the special rituals were performed.  They set up camp for two days at the sites used by the Mau Mau fighters (freedom fighters) during the emergency period in 1952.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This group brought with them sacred stones, some of which were placed at the base of tree seedlings which were then given out only to those who committed themselves to take good care of the plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Jack Githae of the School of Alternative Medicine explained the philosophy of having these stones at the base thus; Stones unlike plants would not die and spiritual blessings given at the mountainpeak would remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offering sacrifice meant that Mt. Kenya was henceforth regarded as a sacred place whose environs should not be defiled by any acts, including unwonted felling of trees in the surrounding forest for timber and firewood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Githae and Prof. Gilbert Ogutu, the Dean of the Department of Religious Studies, University of Nairobi, blame deforestation in the mountain forests to the coming of the white man to Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They contend that the reverence in which the mountain was held died when these foreigners brought their religion (Christianity) and imposed it on the indigenous people. In their teachings, the colonialists dismissed everything African as primitive and heathen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result was gradual loss of respect and fear for African deity. This new trend did not spare Mt. Kenya and man has gone ahead to exploit its forest reserves, destroying a resource base for useful herbal medicine and threatening the survival of these medicinal qualities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. James Dhikusoka Nsobani, the Secretary-General of the Busoga heads of clans council led the Ugandan delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative of Kenya's Luo community from Nyanza Province, raised with APS the concern that there are conflicting approaches to the conducting of ritual ceremonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, Luos do not use a sheep in a cleansing ceremony. When used as a sacrifice, this animal is normally associated with exorcising evil spirits as in the case of a family possessed with evil spirits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The method of killing the animal in the two communities also differs. The Luos kill the animal by slitting its throat as opposed to the strangling method used by the Mt. Kenya community elders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ELCI Media Coordinator Louisa Lockwood, told APS that her organization attached great importance to the Mr. Kenya ceremony since such an activity would ensure that environmental conservation becomes a priority of the local people who have been alienated by modern day environmentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It promotes use of traditional knowledge which people can identify with and hence understand the implications of conserving the resource base of some of their cherished herbal medicines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lockwood noted that protection of forests is not only important for traditional healers, but also for pharmaceutical firms and others concerned in the production of medicine.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - Burundi's military ruler Major Pierre Buyoya has moved to defuse a potential blood bath in his troubled nation of 5 million people, following the death of Archbishop Joachim Ruhuna, leader of Catholics in Burundi killed in an ambush on September 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya himself from the minority Tutsi who are over represented in the army, went on national radio on September 10 to appeal for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I ask people not to commit any acts of vengeance. His blood unjustly spilled could be used to heal our own wounds,&quot; he implored.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Ruhuna, a Tutsi, was killed while travelling with two nuns, two schoolgirls, an accountant, and a driver when his vehicle was ambushed at Murongwe near the central town of Gitega. At least three bodies have been recovered while two more people are missing. Among the dead is a Burundian nun from Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Archbishop's driver who had gone missing for 24 hours, said on the fateful day, their vehicle was fired at by a number of men who suddenly appeared on the road. The archbishop was killed instantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver said he escaped by jumping out of the vehicle, and hiding in the bush. He was uncertain about the identity of the attacker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities in Burundi have blamed the killing of 62-year-old Archbishop Ruhuna on Hutu extremists. He had received numerous death threats due to his constant campaigns against tribal extremists among both the minority Tutsi and majority Hutu ethnic groups. These threats reached a peak during the mass funeral for 300 massacre victims held in Bugendana on July 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the hardline National Council for the Defence of Democracy which speaks for the largest Hutu rebel group, claimed the army, composed mostly of Tutsi, had killed the archbishop because he was a moderate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Pope John Paul II issued a statement at the Vatican saying the killing had filled him with great sadness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I renew my heartfelt appeal for reconciliation in truth and charity,&quot; implored the Catholic Pontiff.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum - Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has successfully mediated an end to the long running hostility between the East African nation of Uganda and its northern neighbour, Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 10 here, Rafsanjani who is on a six-nation tour of Eastern, Central and Southern Africa witnessed the signing of the agreement ending hostilities and restoring diplomatic ties between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement called for &quot;immediate&quot; restoration of diplomatic ties which were severed in March 1995 soon after Ugandan rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) massacred 110 civilians in the northern Ugandan District of Apac.  President Yoweri Museveni angrily charged that Sudan had armed the rebels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the agreement to end hostilities, a tripartite committee comprising Iran, Libya and Malawi - the latter two nations previously tried to mediate peace between Uganda and Sudan - will oversee the implementation of the peace pact that calls for immediate cessation of propaganda campaigns against each other and, more importantly the curtailment of the activities of hostile elements using each other's territory to wage war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the agreement is observed in totality, it means rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), who regularly use Ugandan territory for sanctuary and replenishment of supplies will no longer find refuge there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither will the LRA whose leader Joseph Kony is reliably believed to be camped near Juba at the moment, expect support from Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Uganda and Sudan regularly deny supporting rebels fighting in either country but the recent agreement signed by the two nations calls for a supervised clampdown on rebel activities by the SPLA and the LRA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda will face a major burden as the agreement requires that refugees and all hostile elements be moved 100 kilometres away from the border area.  Uganda has more than 250,000 Sudanese refugees on its territory, most of them camped close to the border with Sudan. Observers expect severe logistical problems for Uganda and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as a consequence of the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before leaving Uganda on September 8, President Rafsanjani was already confident that his mediation would bear fruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Considering the goodwill on both sides, I am quite optimistic the problem will be settled,&quot; Rafsanjani told the press as he prepared to leave the East African country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - A new outbreak of violent fighting between Muslim fundamentalists and Christians has left two people dead and several wounded at Kafachan in Nigeria's northern Kaduna state, military administrators there said here on September 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clashes broke out on September 8 after a Christian preacher, Monday Yakonat, was seized by Islamic extremists as he delivered a public sermon in the mainly Muslim town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yakonet's kidnappers threatened to kill him if he did not renounce his faith and accused him of blaspheming against Islam. A group of Christians then stormed the house where the preacher was being held and rescued him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the fighting that followed, a Muslim and a Christian were killed and several people were injured, mainly with stab wounds, according to the local military authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian press reports had put the toll at five dead and 15 injured and said that, according to witnesses, it took the police several hours to put an end to the fighting, during which a number of vehicles were set ablaze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaduna state's military administrator, Lieutenant-Colonel Hammeed Ibrahim Ali, went to the scene of the violence and visited the injured in hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that he would give a lesson to those who stirred up violence in the name of religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two similar incidents occurred in June in Kaduna state and neighbouring Niger state, claiming at least four lives. About 50 Muslim fundamentalists were subsequently arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Nigeria is inhabited mainly by Muslims, who make up almost 45 per cent of the country's total population estimated at more than 100 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, robbers on September 9 shot and wounded Roman Catholic Bishop Francis Alonge of Ondo Diocese south-western Nigeria, stole his car, money and other valuable items, press reports said here on September 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alonge was attacked late on September 9 by gangsters who stopped his car as he was heading for Benin City, the venue of a Catholic Bishops' Conference which started on September 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hoodlums shot the cleric in both legs and beat up his driver, though he did not resist them, a spokesman of the Catholic Secretariat, Father Emmanuel Ade Badejo, was reported saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishop, 60, who was ordained 30 years ago, is currently recuperating in a private hospital in Benin City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recurrence of the religious violence in the north came despite a decision last July by Nigeria's military rulers to curb religious fundamentalist violence that has caused bloody unrest in northern Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A communique issued on July 14 after a military administrators' meeting in Kaduna said the 16 northern states of the federation would combat religious fundamentalism, which had lately claimed three lives, including that of a policeman. This was the first time the north's chief executives had taken a joint decision to tackle the fundamentalist problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1994, Muslim fanatics in the town of Kano beheaded Gideon Akaluka, a southern Christian trader of the Ibo ethnic group, accusing him of insulting the Islamic faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May last year, religious riots erupted in the same city and at least 30 people were killed. More than 50 people are currently standing trial before a special tribunal set up by the federal government on civil disturbances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joshua Obademi, military administrator of Benue state, said at the end of the Kaduna meeting: &quot;We are concerned that activities of these fanatics have posed a serious threat to security and development of the affected states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workable strategies had been put in place to curb religious disturbances in future, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official did not disclose the strategies, but said they would soon be implemented.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Truth and Reconciliation Commission chairman retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu has promised legal protection for those who testify about abuses they committed during the apartheid era, as the commission's probe entered a critical stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu acknowledged that the commission, which is probing politically motivated crimes between 1960 and 1993, has encountered difficulties in convincing perpetrators to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand that people are scared to speak before us, but we need to know your stories and will protect you once you have spoken,&quot; Tutu told a hearing in Nelspruit, a small town about 400 kilometres east of here on September 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 1,800 people who have applied so far to the commission for legal amnesty, only &quot;a few dozen&quot; have not been imprisoned or charged with crimes, according to press reports here late August.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports cited unnamed human rights lawyers, commission officials and apartheid-era leaders as believing that many perpetrators are worried that testifying to the commission would lead to imprisonment or other legal problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the recent indictment of a top intelligence official, Dirk Coetzee, and several of his former police colleagues, has increased perpetrators' uneasiness about the commission. Human rights lawyer Brian Currin, who represents a number of perpetrators, was quoted saying; &quot;This has become a major problem. I have even advised some people not to apply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While courts are forbidden to use the Truth Commission confessions as evidence, individual testimonies may aid prosecution officials to develop their own new evidence in unsolved cases, Currin was reported saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a number of witnesses in Nelspruit, recently cancelled testimony about the activities of a notorious police-linked gang that operated during the apartheid era, after two witnesses were allegedly assassinated two months ago, the South African Press Agency (SAPA), cited government officials as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several witnesses told the commission on September 2 that white policemen brought their children into the police holding cells in Nelspruit during a student uprising in 1986 to show them what &quot;terrorists&quot; looked like, the SAPA said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unseasiness came at a time when the major combatants during the apartheid era were charging and counter-charging each other on roles they played during the bloody struggle for majority rule in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 5, Zulu nationalist leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi demanded that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigate the killings of 422 leaders of his Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Submitting to the truth body a thick volume of evidence, including a list of 422 IFP local political leaders killed since 1985, Buthelezi said the commission &quot;owes the public of South Africa&quot; an explanation for the deaths, as &quot;nowhere else in the world could killing on such a grand scale go unchallenged and unexplained.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFP was the last of South Africa's political parties to make an official statement to the commission, and did so despite an earlier decision to stay away because of what it perceived as the commission's bias towards the ruling African National Congress of President Nelson Mandela, chief rivals of the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fierce feuding between IFP and ANC supporters in Buthelezi's powerbase, KwaZulu-Natal province, has resulted in nearly 20,000 deaths since 1985, with both sides claiming to be victims of the other's aggression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Boraine, deputy chairman of the commission tried to reassure the IFP leader, however, saying all of the party's inquiries would be tackled by a team of truth commission investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 9, ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa blamed Frederik Willem de Klerk's conservative National Party for the massacre of 29 ANC marchers four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testifying at a hearing of the commission at Bisho, Ramaphosa said the September 1992 massacre, in which soldiers fired on several thousand marchers, should be &quot;squarely&quot; blamed on the regime in the then tribal homeland of Ciskei and de Klerk's former white-led government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramaphosa said Ciskei leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo had been responsible for allowing the deaths, adding that the latter &quot;would not have had the courage to do what he did without&quot; the support of de Klerk's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's homelands, intended as small, semi-independent states to house the country's majority black population, were abolished in the country's transition to democracy in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gqozo, who has been invited to speak to the commission, was ordered a week earlier to pay a fine of 10,000 rand (about $2,500) or go to jail for two years after being convicted of illegal trafficking in diamonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a psychiatric report submitted to court, the ex-leader suffered from feelings of uselessness, guilt and paranoia and was in danger of committing suicide, or believes he has become a target for assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Tutu said the truth body would seek a second medical opinion on Gqozo's condition, saying: &quot;We don't want to subpoena him although we have the power to do it. We do want to set a tentative date for a special hearing when we would be able to hear the brigadier's testimony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other top ANC and NP officials, including former Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha, are later expected to testify to the commission about the massacre.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - A series of consultations on National Councils of Churches (NCCs), round tables and ecumenical enablers bringing together church leaders from 26 African countries ended here on September 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A press release from the Ecumenical Documentation and Information Centre for Eastern and Southern Africa (EDICESA), said the consultations were organized by the World Council of Churches (WCC) Unit IV and hosted by the Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main purpose of the consultation on ecumenical enablers was to consult with people who provide service and those who usually require services in order to define how the services can be regularized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ecumenical enablers were identified as people with special ecumenical experience and technical skills to help churches and church related institutions to deal with issues which hinder their effectiveness and efficiency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consultation aimed to put in place some form of structure so that people who need help can get the correct information on how to get assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was pointed out that the concept of ecumenical enabling ensures that when an organization is in difficulties, it can contact the WCC Africa Desk for assistance, an indication that one can get that expertise from another part of the ecumenical family or from another part of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants also agreed on needs that require enabling services and qualifications that an enabler should possess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major areas of needs were identified as constitutional, management or stewardship issues, human resource development and utilization, finances and resource mobilization, documentation, theological issues, managing change, pastoral and conflict resolutions as well as information technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, at a two-day Round Table Consultation here, participants who included general secretaries of National Councils of Churches (NCCs) and staff from the World Council of Churches (WCC) defined a Round Table (RT) as an &quot;instrument of ecumenical sharing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The concept of a Round Table (RT) is indicative of the fact that everyone has a responsibility, that everyone has something to give and has a need,&quot; said the General Secretary of the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) , Rev. Mutava Musyimi. NCCK's RT is expected to convene in February 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants called for change of attitude on the part of all parties if the essence of ecumenical partnership is to be beneficial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the overall aim of an RT should be the mobilisation and sharing of resources, the Harare meeting advised countries that do not have RTs but are anticipating to have one, not to regard the facility simply as a fund raising mechanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They noted that for RTs to continue serving their purpose, they must be evaluated by stakeholders and external evaluators at set times. In the period 1994, there were 35 RTs in the world, 14 of them in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, African church leaders made an appeal for more ecumenical response to the socio-economic and political issues currently facing their continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call was made following a three-day consultation of general secretaries of National Councils of Churches (NCCs) which ended here on September 3, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussions in group and plenary sessions focussed on issues of ownership, relationships and finance of the NCCs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot continue to do business as usual. We cannot ignore the changes and the impact they have on our work,&quot; said Rev. Richard Murigande, head of the Africa Desk at the WCC, who sighted the fall of the Berlin Wall, the demise of one-party states in Africa and Eastern Europe and the globalization of economies as having impacted directly or indirectly on the work of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Murigande said the changes in Central and Eastern Europe brought new needs in that region and some of the funds that used to support church work in Africa are now channelled to the new needs. He also pointed out that non- governmental organizations (NGOs) in the North are now collecting money for their own constituency to counter new forms of poverty and marginalisation of people in those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial support for the church continues to be reviewed downwards because where the church used to be the only group concerned with the alleviation of poverty, human rights and other socio-economic issues, there are now various organizations working in the same fields and approaching the same donors for funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief executives of the NCCs noted that the new challenges demand that the councils are run by competent and professional staff who are capable of managing change. Thus they resolved to improve working conditions and introduce incentives that attract and retain qualified staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NCCs undertook to develop local fundraising which could go a long way in promoting self-dependency. However, it was realised that local fundraising could only succeed if NCCs are capable of meeting the aspirations and needs of their members. This could be achieved through regular critical self evaluation of the councils and through information sharing and exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Secretary of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC), Rev.  Murombedzi Kuchera said, for NCCs to remain relevant, they should enable the churches to come together through the councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church leaders also took time to discuss trouble spots in Africa, among them Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia and Sudan. The general secretaries of NCCs from these countries briefed the workshop on the situation in their countries before it was resolved that peacemaking mechanisms should be strengthened at local, sub-regional and global levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prayer for peace is the prayer of every African,&quot; said Rev. Murigande.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lokichoggio, Kenya - The New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC) recently organized a workshop to discuss human rights and its biblical context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of its kind, the workshop ran from August 12 to 15 here, some 1000 kilometres north-west of Nairobi. It was jointly supported by the United Nations Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Church Ecumenical Action for Sudan (CEAS) and the Maryknoll Catholic congregation, whose experience was based on the role of the Latin American churches in the struggle for human rights and social justice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-day workshop last month sought a common working ground for the OLS, UNICEF and NSCC in the area of human rights education and advocacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NSCC which is the umbrella of Sudanese churches in exile acknowledges the hope of the Sudanese for a better future by enabling church leaders in Southern Sudan to get involved in monitoring human rights issues based on biblical teachings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Churches and Christian agencies like the Norwegian Church Aid (NCA), World Vision and the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) are also incorporated in the process of human rights advocacy in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think the church has a big role to play in its moral authority to reach the people without political boundaries because human rights are a Christian issue. God created us equally and we should respect each other,&quot; the NSCC peace and justice coordinator Mr. Festus Ufulle Gaaro told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace and justice desk, sponsored by the NSCC, proposed the organization of future human rights workshop whereby the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the Southern Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM), the SPLA-United and other factional groups involved in the conflict in the south would be invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Churches, non-governmental organizations and the community at the grassroots would also participate at such future meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20 participants at the workshop focussed on concerns like child protection, women and the elderly and other victims of the 13 year- old conflict in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the deliberations, participants called for the organization of more similar workshops so that churches can be better equipped in advocating human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting also called for training of trainers in human rights to enhance efficient ways of disseminating human rights materials. The workshop also urged Sudanese churches to fight the forced conscription of children into the government army and the liberation movement forces as well as enslavement of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founded in 1989 the NSCC comprises the Episcopal Church of Sudan (ECS), African Inland Church (AIC), the Catholic Church, Presbyterian Church, Pentecostal Church and the Sudan Interior Mission (SIM).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Communication and education should play a positive role in re-imaging the African continent and church media in particular must make conscious effort to change the stereotypes projected about the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was disclosed at a World Council of Churches (WCC) Unit III meeting held here from August 24 to 30. The forum urged church communicators to avoid being mouth piece of politicians who propagate &quot;cheap politics&quot; and instead play the important role of fostering democracy and peace in society.  Communicators were called upon to practice Christian values so as to communicate them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on leadership, the Director of Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation, Canon Clement Janda, observed that in Africa, there are three categories of leaders: those who lead by virtue of their birth, those who are appointed by others to lead though sometimes they may not be willing or able to serve and &quot; the most dangerous category&quot; made up of those who impose themselves as leaders because they think they are able to lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The third category will use money, influence, guns...anything to coerce people to accept their leadership,&quot; he said. Canon Janda, however, emphasized that the trend in service and ministry today is that &quot;a leader is to be served, to be listened to and not the other way round as ought to be.&quot; He called on leaders (both church and secular) to emulate Christ's example of teaching by example. &quot;While Jesus taught by example, we are teaching by coercion,&quot; he lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director of Communication in the Methodist Church of Benin, Rev.  Raphael Houessou (Service de Communication Journal la SENTINELLE) observed that politics (and consequently leadership) have become a quick means of acquiring resources and is no longer a means of sharing what one can offer by way of leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the church must be united if it is to fight poverty. He however observed that more attention is paid to theological differences rather than unifying factors among churches thus retarding progress. Rev.  Houessou called on the church to &quot;respect its diversity but work together&quot; for the churches' unity and progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madame Agathe Okumba D'Okwatsengue of the National Council of Communication (Conseil National de la Communication) in Gabon, pointed out; &quot;The fight for leadership in our churches will bring disaster&quot; and appealed to churches to be &quot;the light of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mme Okumba also criticised communicators who show off and work for personal glory. She likened this state of affairs to &quot;showbiz&quot;, lamenting that it has greatly contributed to lack of objectivity in reporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director of the Harare-based Ecumenical Documentation and Information Centre for Eastern and Southern Africa (EDICESA), Ms. Tendai Chikuku Nyahoda, lamented the arrogance with which some Christians used God-given gifts. &quot; Everything comes from God. Some church leaders assume it is because of their own abilities that they are leaders, an assumption that leads to strife&quot; within the churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also called on South Africa as a nation &quot;to become part of the region through identifying with others in the region&quot; so as to strengthen the region's economic and political position. The EDICESA head added that South Africa &quot;owes a debt&quot; to neighbouring countries (and others) for the contribution they made to that counry's liberation struggle and that South Africa should reciprocate by working with them not in isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Roger Tessier, a correspondent for the Brussels-based Africa News Bulletin (ANB), pointed out that there can be no spiritual healing without recognition of what the problem is. &quot;There can be no social change without the recognition of what is to be changed. The church must invest in personnel and resources in order to be equipped for the service of the church to bring change,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants at the meeting concurred that there is need to re-orient church communication personnel and to encourage creative approaches to communication by providing relevant training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A journalist with the Protestant Methodist Church in Cote d'Ivoire, Rosine Diodan, called on churches to review women's role in the church. She shared Mme Okumba's sentiments that &quot;the church has not succeeded in overcoming gender discrimination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that women are not seen as complete human beings, adding that the question about whether or not women have a soul is still valid today. That &quot; there is no place for women in the church&quot; is a moral issue especially among Christians, said Diodan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the convener of the meeting, Rev. Daniel Ntoni-Nzinga, the study group of Communication is one of the four that are aimed at deliberating the broader theme: Towards a Reconstruction for Africa. The study groups are; Democracy and the Ethics of Good Governance; Land, Labour and Capital; Communication and Human Dignity; and Ecumenism, Partnership and Human Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1991, the WCC Central Committee invited all WCC member churches and the ecumenical movement at large to &quot;view Africa with new eyes.&quot; Consequently, in 1995, the Unit III Programme on Justice and Creation adopted a programme for peace with justice as an ecumenical contribution towards reconstruction in Africa. To achieve its goals, the Programme has been promoting solidarity with Africa through ecumenical exchange visits and study groups which have been taking place since June 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was held at the Technikon SA Conference Centre in Johannesburg, and deliberated on the subject; Communication and Human Dignity: The Cost of Mediated Reality. Participants came from Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Congo, Cote d'ivoire, Gabon, Kenya, Mozambique, Togo, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dodoma, Tanzania - A bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT), has told politicians and church leaders in this East African country to bear in mind that the Church was not partisan to any political party during the last general elections in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Dr. Peter Mwamasika of the ELCT, Dodoma Diocese, on September 8 told a day-long seminar on parliamentary civic education programme at the new parliamentary complex in this central Tanzanian town, that the country was among the few nations which went into plural politics peacefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Dr. Mwamasika, a former legislator, also told the seminar participants who included MPs, church leaders among them Bishop Mathias Isuja of the Catholic Diocese of Dodoma, prominent political leaders, ministers and representatives from media institutions and non-governmental organizations, that the church was committed to pray for peaceful elections as well as solving problems facing people regardless of religion, sex, race, tribe and political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he wanted to know the origin of the daily prayers said in the (National Assembly) House and suggested the setting up of a chapel whose chaplain would conduct services before every session.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the questions raised by Bishop Dr. Mwamasika, National Assembly Speaker Mr. Pius Msekwa said, daily prayers conducted in the House before the start of business embraced beliefs of all religions and denominations and that words contained in the prayers were not directed to specific denominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Msekwa also said there were no plans to open a chapel at the House premises as Tanzania is a secular state and if a chapel was opened, that would mean the National Assembly would be directing itself to specific religions. He said jokingly that the speaker is the House's chaplain and admitted that the prayer was copied from the British parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speaker also enlightened seminar participants on the current structure of the National Assembly and how it has implemented its various responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Willbrod Slaa, former Secretary-General of the Tanzania Episcopal Conference (TEC), currently the MP for Karatu constituency in the Arusha region and member of CHADEMA Party, presenting a paper on the role of the opposition parties in the National Assembly said opposition MPs were in the House constitutionally and should not be regarded by the people as trouble makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the introduction of multi-party politics in developing countries was perceived as a threat to the government especially by the ruling political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributing to the discussion, Dr. Aman Kabourou (CHADEMA MP for Kigoma urban) said during the early stages of political reform in East Africa, people agitating for more democracy were regarded as enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another opposition MP Mr. Isaac Cheyo, representing Bariadi West called for education on the legality of opposition parties in the country to enhance political harmony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that during the 1995 general elections, the electorate was influenced to hate the opposition as a bad &quot;animal&quot; that should not be entertained. &quot;The artificial hatred was caused by lack of education on the new political system,&quot; explained Mr. Cheyo, who is also Chief Whip of the Opposition in the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that people were made to believe that voting for the opposition was suicidal and was related to the 1994 genocide in neighbouring Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A secondary school teacher Ms Asia Maalim, said literature on civic education must be made available in schools to ensure the programme succeeds.  She claimed that teachers at seconday schools in Dodoma have not been able to teach civic subjects due to lack of materials, thus implying that most schools in Tanzania are lacking essential materials for studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inaugurating the civic education programme, Prime Minister Mr. Fredrick Sumaye asked experts, institutions and political parties to assist the government to educate the masses on the importance of the programme, &quot;as this could not be done by the National Assembly alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanzanian Premier stressed the use of means of media including seminars, lectures, radio programmes, newspapers, use of short film shows, printed materials and public addresses to boost the programme so that it can reach the remote rural areas where majority of the voters are ignorant of civic education. &quot;The focus should be to reach majority of the people who live in rural areas where newspapers do not reach easily,&quot; he emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sumaye also mentioned the three pillars of the state - judiciary, legislature and executive saying, where they worked in harmony and with respect for one another, democracy flourished and was seen to exist. &quot;The three should never suppress each other,&quot; he cautioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on, National Assembly Clerk Mr. George Francis Mlama, explained that the civic education programme was focussed on the public as a way of informing them of the way in which parliament conducts its business. He said parliamentary civic education will also be taught in schools to enlighten students on how the National Assembly operates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mlama confirmed that the Ford Foundation has offered to sponsor the programme through publication of printed materials and radio programmes but did not disclose how much money would go into the venture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African religious leaders are divided over whether President Nelson Mandela and his newly declared love, Graca Machel, wife of the late Mozambican President Samora Machel, should live together out of wedlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most wished happiness for the 78-year-old leader, they disagreed on how he should proceed in his affair with the 50-year-old widow of the late Mozambican president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a friend of Mandela's, raised eyebrows when he urged that the couple marry as a good example to the country's youth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on September 9, Sadullah Khan, director of Cape Town's Islamic Centre, echoed Tutu's sentiments when he said that the Muslim faith could not support a casual or permissive relationship, even in the case of a revered leader like Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mandela is close to a saint in our hearts, but if we are to believe reports that he is having a teenaged relationship, then we cannot condone it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would urge (Mandela) to be a bit more cautious in his personal life for the sake of our youth,&quot; Khan added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple, who announced their relationship early September, have no plans to marry, according to a Mandela spokesman, although Machel intends spending two weeks a month at Mandela's home in the Johannesburg suburb of Houghton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machel will spend the rest of her time with her family in Mozambique, doing charity work, the spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As both are national figures,&quot; Catholic Archbishop Lawrence Henry was quoted by the Star daily here, &quot;I am confident that whatever they decide on their future together will be done with careful consideration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Catholic official, however, named in the newspaper only as Father Blaser of the South African Catholic Bishops' Conference, said: &quot;This would be (Mandela's) third marriage and the Catholic Church would certainly have a problem with him going for his third marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greek Orthodox Archbishop Paul Lingris said his church could not condone any couple living together out of wedlock, &quot;but (Mandela) is of an old age -- he wants company, that's what he wants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ray McCauley, head of the Evangelical Rhema Ministries, called on Mandela and Machel to wed because the president is lonely and elderly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be wonderful for him to have a woman companion to care and look after him,&quot; he told the Star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W.J. Botha of the mainly Afrikaner Dutch Reformed Church offered personal blessings, saying: &quot;I'm very happy and very glad he's met someone. I hope she will be a blessing and will find joy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's chief Rabbi Cyril Harris was reported saying he was delighted that Mandela had found love, and said: &quot;People are entitled to their happiness and Judaism would say it is far, far better for two people to be together than to be lonely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela was divorced from his second wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in March after a four-year separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple, who were married in 1958, lived together only briefly after Mandela was released in 1990 from 27 years in prison under apartheid. They have two daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela has a son and daughter from his first wife, Evelyn Mase Ntoko.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cairo - Islamic militants shot dead a Coptic Christian and hacked off his head in a village in Minya region of southern Egypt, police announced here on September 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The armed fundamentalists attacked Asham Nabi Tawfiq, 45, a municipal worker, in Gala Basha in Minya province before decapitating him and escaping with his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the militants were probably from the outlawed Jamaa Islamiyya (Islamic Group) and targeted Tawfiq because he collaborated with security services and took part in police raids in local villages.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the third time Muslim militants have decapitated their victim. Last September, they killed and beheaded a farmer in a crowded market place in Minya then left his head on an electricity pylon as a warning to police informants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July, a rural guard suspected of collaboration was beheaded, also in Minya province, a militant stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing came in the wake of the shooting and killing on August 25 by unidentified gunmen of four people and wounding of a fifth in southern Egypt, according to a statement issued by the Interior Ministry on August 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack took place in the village of Qariyat Roman in the district of Abu Qurqas in the province of Minya province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attackers opened fire at a group of people standing outside a house, killing four men and wounding a fifth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the dead were identified as Christians and the fourth as a Muslim while the injured man was also thought to be Christian, according to a list of names provided by the ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 1,060 people -- including many Coptic Christians -- have been killed since Islamic militants spearheaded by the outlawed militant group, the Jamaa Islamiyya, launched a violent anti-government campaign in March 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest attack came after the American Coptic Union urged the US Congress on August 24 to investigate killings of Christians in Egypt and postpone aid to the North African nation until basic rights and security were secured for all citizens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Nigeria's Methodist Church has approved the ordination of women as priests, the church's leader Sunday Mbang announced here on September 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to ordain women was taken at the end of the just-concluded 35th annual conference of the church held at Ikot-Ekpene in Nigeria's south- eastern Akwa Ibom state, Mbang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The training, qualification, screening and ordination of women to priesthood would be on the same terms as their male counterparts, he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbang, who is also the national president of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said, &quot;women will be trained, just like men, we would not lower their grade or give anybody who is not qualified ordeserving the post any opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this decision, The Methodist Church of Nigeria has become the first member of the CAN to approve the ordination of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early last year, an attempt by the Ilorin diocese of the Anglican Communion in Nigeria to ordain women as priests was rejected by the Anglican Church hierarchy and the three women who were ordained by the Anglican bishop of Ilorin diocese were later de-robed by the headquarters of the Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic Church in Nigeria is still opposed to the ordination of women as priests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early this year, Rev. Maureen Elizabeth Jones of the Methodist Church in Kenya made history by becoming the first woman bishop in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consecrated bishop on January 14, 1996, Rev. Jones who beat three other male contestants told APS in an interview then; &quot;To be honest, I did not expect it...I am very moved and very honoured...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in England in 1939, Rev. Jones said that working as a bishop, and particularly being a white woman bishop among blacks does not make her feel discriminated against. &quot;I have lived with these people for many years and I have never felt discriminated,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She came to Kenya in 1969.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaoma left for Italy with the clearance letters on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International boxing referee, Felix Phiri, said this is a big day for Zambian boxing and called on all boxing lovers to pray for Chingangu.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not break camp as such. But whilst we will not be training all together, we will continue with the training programmes in which Copperbelt- based players will be training at least three days a week,&quot; said Phiri who added that the same arrangement will be used for the Lusaka-based players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia will now have to wait for the winners of the Namibia-Botswana match, for the second round matches to be played in December.</SPAN></P>

The President assured the Secretary- General that he was in excellent health and intended to return &quot; very, very quickly&quot; to Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General offered his best wishes and they had a good talk.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To a question regarding whether or not the Secretary-General had asked President Mobutu of Zaire about the situation of staff members of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in his country, Ms. Foa said that the conversation had been confined to Mr. Mobutu's health. Discussions were under way between United Nations agencies in Zaire and that Government, she added. The incidents in question were being taken very seriously. She had heard of several minor incidents recently, including incidents with staff of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) riding in a vehicle of the World Food Programme (WFP). As the incidents had taken place in a very remote region, information was taking up to five days to reach Headquarters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is a statement by White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States welcomes the recent announcement issued by the Burundian authorities lifting the ban on political parties and restoring the National Assembly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We view this as a significant step in the right direction. At the same time, we look forward to clarification of some aspects of the announcement and to the effective and impartial implementation of these decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States again urges all concerned parties in Burundi to launch, immediately and unconditionally, a negotiating process aimed at ending the killing and establishing a framework for all-party negotiations. This is the way to address the root causes of the conflict and to bring about a better future for all Burundians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we continue to call on the Burundian authorities to take further steps to achieve national reconciliation, we stress that the National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD) and all opposition parties must take up the offer of talks and not obstruct them. It is time to stop the killing and start talking. The United States condemns in particular all attacks against civilians and population centers. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1072 emphasized the international community's readiness to consider additional measures aimed at any party, inside or outside Burundi, that is not demonstrating a commitment to a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the July 25 coup, the United States has consistently called on the Burundian authorities to guarantee safe passage out of the country for President Ntibantunganya and others who continue to be accorded refuge in the U.S. and other Embassies. Their freedom to depart the country would be another important indication of the seriousness of the Burundian authorities in seeking an end to the current crisis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Lionel Williams, PANA Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - Graca Machel, widow of the late President Samora Machel of Mozambique, has spoken out in public on her romance with President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, dubbed the African romance of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview on South African national radio, Graca, 50, said that she and Mandela were happy to have found each other after lives filled with suffering.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just wonderful,&quot; she said, &quot;that after so much pain I have gone through--and I believe that is also from Nelson's side--that finally we have found each other and can share a life together.&quot; After months of speculation, the Mandela-Graca romance was confirmed at the beginning of this month. It was stated at the time that the couple had not made plans to marry, but that Graca would be spending two weeks of every month at Mandela's Johannesburg home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been some criticism of this decision, and certain sources have suggested that if Mandela does not actually marry Graca, he would not be setting a good example to the youth of southern Africa as the new Chairman of the Southern African Development Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on South African radio this week, Graca would not go into any further detail about the romance, describing herself as a very private person.  All she would add was: &quot;It is just wonderful. There were times when I thought it couldn't happen any more in my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graca's husband was killed in an air crash 10 years ago, and Mandela divorced his wife, Winnie, earlier this year after a steady deterioration in their marriage since his release from prison in early 1990.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YAOUNDE, Cameroon (PANA) - President Paul Biya of Cameroon Thursday appointed Peter Masani Musonge, a 54-year-old engineer, as the country's new prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musonge, who hails from Buea, in the country's Anglophone south-west province, replaces Simon Achidi Achu as head of government, according to a presidential decree issued here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is expected to form a government within the coming days, observers in the cameroonian capital said, pointing out that the rather expected change could be connected with forthcoming presidential and legislative elections whose dates are yet to be announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musonge was born in Buea, capital of the south-western province on Dec. 3, 1942. He attended secondary school at saint Joseph's secondary school in Sasse in what was then known as the Fako division of former western Cameroon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later studied in the United States, obtaining his first degree in civil engineering from the Dext Institute of Technology in Philadelphia, and a master's degree in structural engineering from Stanford university, California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On returning to Cameroon in 1969, the new premier worked as an engineer with the public works department where he occupied various top level positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, he was named director of the national civil engineering pool and elevated to the post of general manager of the pool in 1987. He later became general manager of the Cameroon Development Corporation, a vast public agro- industrial concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musonge is married with four children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria Thursday accused neighboring Cameroon of renewed aggression in the Bakassi peninsula, barely 24 hours after the United Nations goodwill mission concluded its visit to Cameroon over the disputed territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I speak to you now, reports that we received in the past day or two is of hostility unleashed again by Cameroon in the Bakassi area,&quot; Nigerian foreign minister, Tom Ikimi, told members of the visiting U.N. mission in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi alleged that the resumption of hostility by CameroOn has cast doubt on that country's commitment to the current mediatory efforts of the U.N.  Secretary-General represented by the mission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We complain that if this visit was accepted by Cameroon and us, why should they (Cameroon) unleash hostility only 24 hours ago?&quot; the Nigerian minister asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both countries claiming ownership of the oil-rich peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea, have clashed repeatedly in the area since 1994. Both have troops on either side of the disputed peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi restated Nigeria's commitment to the resolution of the conflict through dialogue in the spirit of good neighborliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigeria would not wage war on Bakassi because waging war on Bakassi would be waging war against our people,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All Nigeria is doing,&quot; the minister explained, &quot;is to exercise the legitimate responsibility of the government to protect its citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He blamed the dispute on the &quot;unfortunate&quot; legacy of the partitioning of Africa in a way that not only left &quot;brothers and sisters on different lines&quot; of international boundaries, but has saddled the continent with boundary disputes within the last century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-member U.N. team is led by Omar Halim from Indonesia. It includes Willy Vanstraelen from Belgium as well as Mpazi Sinjela and N'tumba Makombo from Zambia and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameroon has also reported the dispute to the International Court of Justice, at the Hague, and the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Halim said the mission was sent to help reduce tension between both countries through confidence building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He insisted that the initiative was not intended to undermine the efforts of the International Court of Justice and that of President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo in trying to resolve the dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The (U.N.) Secretay-General is concerned that skirmishes could inevitably affect the relationship between both brotherly countries and feels that perhaps he could play a role,&quot; Halim added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation will be briefed by Nigerian government officials and tour the disputed area during the visit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to today's issue of the independent newsheet 'Nediafax', Maria Guebuza was attacked by two men armed with knives near the presidential palace, where she had just driven her niece to an apartment bloc. The two were talking outside the car when the attack occurred.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guebuza suffered stab wounds to her chest and legs. But her son and hospital sources confirm that she is out of danger - although doctors were refusing to allow anyone, even family, to visit her on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armando Guebuza, who is also member a member of the frelimo political committee was the chief government negotiator of the 1992 peace agreement, that ended a 16-year old civil war which was waged by the rebel Renamo movement against the Maputo INL002 from SSS.058 (960919-18:32) QN PANAINL .

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guebuza son, 17-year old Mussumbuluku said the motive was car theft, and that his mother's vehicle, a &quot;Ford Telstar&quot;, was stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mediafax also reported Thursday that on Tuesday, at roughly the same time as maria guebuza was attacked, armed men raided the Maputo offices of two European non-governmental organizations, Handicap International and Action Nord-Sud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The raiders immobilized the two guards on duty (employees of a private security company), beat up the people they found in the offices and made off with 8,000 US dollars and 20 million meticais, the Mozambican currency (about 1,740 dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday morning, unknown assailants brutally murdered a 60-year old housewife in a ground floor flat on one of Maputo's principal avenues. The raiders strangled the women, tied up her servant, and stole a variety of goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a second raid on the same street later in the day, the police say that the victim, a man named Rassul Baby, died of a heart attack, brought on by the shock of the attack.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The first ever solar car race in Africa has been planned for March 1998, a spokesperson for Africa Solar Race Private Limited, a Zimbabwean company jointly organizing the race with Unesco, disclosed here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty solar cars, including 20 from Africa, are expected to cover the 2,745- kilometer (1,716 miles) journey from Harare to Cape Town in 10 days, with a stop-over in Gaborone, Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race is intended as a follow-up to the just-ended World Solar Summit in Harare, to create public awareness of the potential of solar energy utilization in industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of universities in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana and Ghana have indicated their willingness to develop appropriate solar cars for the race.  Tunisia and Cote d'Ivoire were also said to be interested in participating in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesperson said participating universities and institutions were expected to finance construction of the cars or seek the collaboration of car manufacturers such as General Motors, Honda, Mitsubishi, among others, which usually sponsor similar events in the United States, Japan and Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africa race is expected to start from Harare's International Conference Center, venue of the world solar summit which ended Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders at the summit launched the 10-year World Solar Programme, which underscores the potential of solar energy to contribute to sustained global social and economic development and utilization new renewable sources of energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Unesco-sponsored programme, which is expected to be executed between 1996 and 2005, is an open-ended global attempt by governments in partnership with other organizations to popularize the adoption and wider use of solar power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is to evolve over the decade through development and implementation of some 300 top priority national, regional and global solar projects in various fields. The programme will be overseen by a 16-member Solar Commission comprising world leaders chaired by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unesco estimates that some 2.4 billion people, mostly in developing countries, lack access to electricity, a major cause of poverty and lost opportunity for concrete social and economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim, said at the summit that Africa had an obligation to increase the continent's per capita energy consumption by exploiting the abundant unconventional energy resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The successful harnessing, development and utilization of this energy source will clearly have far-reaching positive impact on the development of our (African) countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa will tremendously benefit from the successful utilization of solar as it will constitute an appropriate alternative to the use of firewood which is the cause of serious deforestation and considerable environmental degradation in our continent,&quot; Salim told the gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit stressed that new renewable sources of energy including the sun, wind, biomass, ocean currents, among others, were cheaper and environmentally- friendly alternatives, when compared to fossil-based fuels like coal and petroleum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Leading African film-makers are due here on Friday for a week-long Southern African Film Festival (SAFF), which seeks to boost the film industry in the 12-nation Southern African Development Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the biennial event, being held for the first time as a SADC culture and information sector project, over 20 African feature films will be screened as well as 34 documentaries and short films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAFF director, Isaac Mabhikwa, said Thursday that the main objective of the festival was to bring together the continent's film-makers to review progress made to date, and to chart the course for the industry's future development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The development of the film industry of our region is lagging behind and the festival will look at what we can do and how we can do it to improve the situation,&quot; Mabhikwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional integration through co-operation in production, distribution and exhibition of African films, which have been major hurdles for African artists, will be discussed as an important feature of the festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The festival also provides an opportunity for SAFF to lobby SADC governments to carve policies conducive to the development of the film industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running concurrently with the festival would be two workshops on film financing and the Pan-African Union of Women film-makers, which will discuss ways of boosting the involvement and participation of women in film-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Film financing will be a major topic for discussion during the SAFF workshops because there is a serious need to boost production quality as well as output in order to sustain a viable film industry,&quot; Mabhikwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAFF is expected to create a self-sustainable film production unit and discussions on film financing are targeted to improve the quality and step up production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly all of southern African countries have not achieved their film production potential, with an average of one film being produced each year by one country, said Mabhikwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Zimbabwe had potential to produce about three feature films per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries failed to achieve their optimum largely due to financial handicaps and the establishment of a film fund was envisaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The festival was supposed to have been held in 1995 as a follow-up to one in 1993, but it had not been possible because there was no permanent SAFF office, making communication difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;SAFF needs a director in a permanent office to follow-up, develop, present and report on the film festival,&quot; he said. The festival will organize public screening - from Sept. 20 to 26 in Harare and from Sept. 27 to Oct. 3 in Bulawayo - and screen films which won prizes at the continental festival in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A film competition is to be held comprising feature films, short films and documentaries from east and southern Africa which were produced after October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabhikwa said for SAFF to be successful, it needed to create links and relations which will ease access to African films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Various factors contribute to this difficulty, including poor transport and communications infrastructure in many countries on the continent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three Zimbabwean films will be featured - I Am The Future, Flame and Everyone's Child. From South Africa will be Soweto Green, Cry The Beloved Country and Jump. Seven feature films from north and west Africa will also be screened. Three Kenyan female film-makers were expected to attend the festival.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Civic organisations will tomorrow hold a national convention on Zambia's political future at Lusaka's Mulungushi International Conference Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a statement drawn up by the Legal Resource Foundation on behalf of the civic organisations and released by Inter-African Network for Human Rights and Development (AFRONET) executive director, Ngande Mwanajiti, in Lusaka yesterday the organisations have decided to hold the convention because of the worrying political situation in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the past months we, as civic organisations, have seen events unfold which threaten to undermine the forth-coming presidential and parliamentary elections and the prospects of democracy in Zambia,&quot; part of the statement reads. &quot;The MMD and the government on one hand and the opposition parties on the other are not agreed on the way forward. This situation has provided the basis for our involvement. The issues raised touch on matters which fall within our areas of interests as civic organisations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second time the country's civic organisations will convene over the political situation in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last September the organisations convened at the same venue, Mulungushi International Conference Centre, and resolved to hold a &quot;Citizen's Convention&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Citizen's Convention, the organisations came up with what was called a &quot;Green Paper&quot; which outlined their stand on various issues, among them the adoption of the Constitution, the Public Order Act and the electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tomorrow's convention is expected to focus on these issues and, according to the statement, &quot;determine the way forward&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The deliberations of the convention will not be in a vacuum but will be guided by the fact that Zambia has committed itself to democracy and the resolutions of the convention will be assessed in terms of how we can enhance and consolidate democracy in Zambia,&quot; the statement says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - State House has accused UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda and Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) chairman Roger Chongwe as the source of first lady Vera Chiluba's drug story which was published by German and the South African newspapers and on Wednesday quoted by The Post newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Frederick Chiluba's public relations and press assistant Richard Sakala, at a State House press briefing yesterday, also disclosed that the President has decided to seek legal redress against former president Kaunda, Chongwe and The Post newspaper for publishing, &quot;patently malicious lies aimed to injure the first family&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;State House has fully investigated the circumstance and sources of the story published in The Post Newspaper of Wednesday, September 18, 1996 entitled 'Vera linked to drugs' ,&quot; the statement issued by Sakala to government owned and controlled media read. &quot;We have since established the fact that the source of the story is former president Dr. Kenneth Kaunda.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kaunda in an interview with ZNBC yesterday wished President Chiluba good luck in his efforts to sue him and could neither deny nor confirm that he was the source of The Post story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Chongwe, who is an eminent human rights lawyer, said as long as the President waives his immunity they were prepared for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President is just like any other person and he should realise that under the Constitution of Zambia he does not have immunity when it comes to such cases,&quot; Chongwe said in an interview yesterday. &quot;Once he continues taking people to courts his immunity wanes. We are prepared for any action he is going to take.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakala claimed in his briefing that between 11 and 14 August 1996 Robert Von Lucius, theESouth African correspondent of the German daily newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), visited Zambia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and it was during the same visit that he met former president Kaunda and Chongwe who told him that President Chiluba wasEEactively involved in drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dr Kaunda further told Lucius that he was at the Jan Smuts Airport on October 11, 1996 when the first lady Mrs Vera Chiluba was caught with 4 kilos of cocaine,&quot;Sakala said. &quot;The same reporter interviewed Dr. Rodger Chongwe who also told the reporter and I quote, 'Mr Chongwe maintained that the President was himself a drug dealer'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakala further told the press briefing that the President was deeply concerned by the continuing malicious defamation and slander orchestrated by former president Kaunda overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The attack on Mrs Chiluba in The Post, which incidentally was availed this information, is seen as the continuing crusade against the Zambian leadership, &quot; Sakala said. &quot;The President has therefore decided to seek legal redress against Dr. Kaunda, Dr. Chongwe and The Post newspaper for publishing patently malicious lies aimed to injure the first family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a telephone interview, Sakala angrily refused to reveal when the President will take the matter to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is your problem, what is your problem you people?&quot; Sakala asked before slamming the telephone receiver down.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya Thursday instructed police and local administration officials to crack down on the brewing and consumption of illicit liquor, following the deaths of some 20 people in the country's central province after consumption of a local brew, chang'aa', which also left six others irreversibly blind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports in Friday's daily newspapers indicated that the mysterious alcoholic brew was pure poison which the victims mistook for chang'aa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi expressed concern over the deaths, saying the incident could have been prevented. He warned that any law enforcement officer who will be lax in implementing the directive would be sacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the 26 victims took methanol, a colorless flammable toxic liquid which even in small doses may cause blindness, whose water content was a negligible 0.1 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poisonous chemical is usually used in the manufacture of paint thinner, varnish and other related chemicals specifically meant for industrial use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chang'aa has always been an illegal drink but, the government has in the past allowed the brew during traditional ceremonies, with the permission of local chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi recalled that he had banned the illegal brew in 1980, when he told Kenyans he wanted to lead a healthy nation. However, he said, the brew had slowly resurfaced in many parts of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - The Kenya government has confirmed that devil worship cults exist in the country and advised the public to desist from getting involved in the practice which is in its formative stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government statement broadcast over the government-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Friday, said self-confessed devil worshippers practiced such rituals as human sacrifice, the drinking of human blood, eating of human flesh and the celebration of black mass by nude worshippers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelations came from a government-appointed commission of inquiry set up on March 1, 1995, following widespread public concern over the alleged devil worship in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government first appointed a committee in October 1994, which was later upgraded into a commission owing to the seriousness of the matter, the legal implications and the general complexity of the assignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission was also to establish the extent and effects of satanic infiltration in educational institutions and society, establish its reported linkage to drug abuse and other anti-social activities and make the necessary recommendations to deal firmly with the menace. The commission's report, which has since been submitted to the government, confirms that devil worship does indeed exist in Kenya and its horrible practices were even more bizarre than the Kenyans ever imagined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other rituals listed are incantations in unintelligible languages, sexual abuse and rape of children and minors, black magic, use of narcotic drugs and holding snakes in reverence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After carefully considering the reports from the individuals with personal experience in the cults and evidence from self-confessed devil worshippers whose submissions were confirmed by credible independent sources, the commission found ample corroborative evidence of the devil worship,&quot; the government said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission had also received information of horrifying criminal cases including kidnapping especially of children, rape, child abuse, murders, and the severing of body parts such as the tongue and the limbs and gouging out of the eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cult members also use strange symbols, signs and codes, and are obsessed with sex and especially homosexuality and lesbianism. They use frightening names such as the killer, cobra, scorpion, and the python.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the statement, the government had carefully studied the commission's recommendations which had far reaching implications on learning and other institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The first batch of South African farmers has arrived in the northernmost Mozambican province of Niassa, reports Friday's issue of the Maputo-published daily, Noticias. The newspaper quoted the Niassa provincial director of agriculture and fisheries, Inocencio Sotomane, as saying they were &quot;more than 20&quot; settlers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of the settlers' arrival came shortly after an announcement by the South African Chamber for Agricultural Development of Africa (SACADA) that they were not expected in Mozambique until the end of September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The white South Africans are expected to invest in Mozambique's agricultural sector under a joint Mozambique-South African bilateral programme called the &quot;Mosagrius Development Corporation&quot; agreed upon by the two governments in May this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Niassa agro-industrial and trade association, Fazal Laca, has said the Mosagrius project brings hope for the development of the province, which is poverty-stricken despite its excellent natural conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Laca, the Mosagrius programme will consist of a variety of projects where Mozambicans and South Africans are expected to invest, particularly in the area of services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the programme will involve the improvement of transport and access routes, the building and repair of roads, to allow easier marketing of agricultural production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Sotamane said that areas have already been allocated to the South African investors. He said that Majune district will be for agricultural projects, whereas Sanga and Lago districts will be for livestock raising and eco-tourism projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lago contains the spectacular mountain scenery and unspoiled beaches of Lake Niassa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mosagrius agreement, endorsed by Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano and his South African counterpart, Nelson Mandela, is renewable every ten years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It paves ways for the settling of South African farmers in areas of low incidence of land conflict, particularly the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Niassa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - A giant South African mining group plans to boost production by 60 percent in southern Mali's Syama Gold mine, one of West Africa's biggest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company concerned is Randgold Resources--the exploration and new business arm of Randgold and Exploration Company, which took over control of BHP Minerals Mali this month from Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement included a 65-percent stake in the Syama Gold Mine, as well as BHP's exploration interests in Mali at a cost of 30 million U.S. dollars in cash; a 23-million-dollar loan claim; and a US 31-million-dollar loan to be retained by BHP and repaid over a six-year period.</SPAN></P>

A company spokesman said that this would be achieved by modernizing machining methods and improving staff morale.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Foreign investors have since June 23, 1993, purchased shares worth more than 2.9 billion Zimdollars (290 million U.S.  Dollars) on the local stock exchange, now one of the world's top five emerging indices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics released by stockbrokers, Edwards (Amper) Company, showed that purchases since government announced foreign investors could participate on the exchange had as of Sept. 13, reached 291 million U.S. dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The net inflow after sales during the same period totalled 122 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stock market's capitalization had increased from 4.4 billion U.S.  dollars in the week ending Sept. 9, to 4.7 billion dollars a week later, reflecting heavy trading on selected key industrial counters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a review, the firm said foreigners were generally sellers while local institutions and individual investors remained strong buyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selling by foreigners was noted in the food manufacturing firm, Cairns, the blue-chip conglomerate, Delta Corporation and sugar grower, Hippo Valley Estates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deals took place in the Barclays bank, the tobacco group TSL and the largest hotel and leisure group, Zimsun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm cautioned the recent bull run on the stock market, which has seen the industrial index hitting daily records since Sept. 4 could be short-lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite the lower than expected inflation figures for August at 17.65 percent, we feel that the 19 percent rise in the market since the beginning of September indicates that the market has become overheated. A small correction and return to reality may not be too far off,&quot; the firm said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign investors were recently allowed by the central bank to increase their holdings in listed companies from 35 percent to 40 percent, and from 5 percent to 10 percent purchases in a single stock.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - As the saying goes, there is always light at the end of the tunnel, but for Kenya, where the clamor for constitutional reforms among opposition politicians, churches, NGOs as well as professionals and individuals continues, it is hard to visualize where the debate is headed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the repeal of section 2A of the country's constitution in 1991, ushering in multiparty politics, no other issue has generated as much political passion and controversy as the calls for constitutional reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the time the opposition in Kenya lost the 1992 general elections, won by the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU), they have come to regard the current constitutional arrangement as the major stumbling block to their collective political ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts say the opposition have come to regard constitutional reforms as the only way to ensure a level playing field which they consider crucial in their campaign to dislodge KANU from power. As a result, they have concentrated a lot of energy on the issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Professor Henry Mwanzi, the constitutional reforms stem from the fear of the 25-percent rule, passed by parliament in 1992. The rule requires that a winner in the presidential elections garner at least 25 percent of the vote in at least five of the country's eight provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The desire by opposition parties to have the 25-percent rule changed stem from the fact that they do not have a candidate who can get votes outside tribal area,&quot; observes Mwanzi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bone of contention in the constitutional furor between KANU and opposition parties has been the forum for effecting the required constitutional reforms and when this should be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Daniel Arap Moi has made it clear that the forum at which constitutional changes would be effected was parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, according to a Nairobi lawyer, Joseph Mutava, parliament lacks the professional capacity to comprehensively review the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The partisan interests in the current parliament and the huge majority the ruling party, KANU, has,&quot; he argued, &quot;would make it almost impossible for the house to give rational and fair views on the constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the parliament could not effectively debate constitutional changes as the members would be fronting for their own interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told a recent Nairobi workshop on constitutional reforms that parliament did not have the capability to handle the complex process of constitutional reform without input from elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other interest groups have now joined the bandwagon for the reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic church, in a recent a pastoral, said it could not avoid dabbling in politics as it dealt with social and political issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church and state, it noted, had the same goal--to improve the welfare of Kenyans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition and interest groups would prefer that constitutional reforms be effected before the next general elections in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Attorney-General, Amos Wako, says the need for constitutional review should not he tied to the next general election, not only because of the time factor but also because most of all the issues concerning the election can be dealt with at legislative and policy levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening a constitutional conference in August at the Kenya coastal city of Mombasa, Wako advocated for a national constitutional review committee and not a national convention or conference as the best way to effect constitutional change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a committee, he said, would traverse the country collecting views and make recommendations based on consensus. The recommendations would then be debated in parliament which is the only institution that can effect a constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the constitutional debate rages on, analysts and observes of the Kenyans political scenario agree that the opposition have continued to wrangle and split and form new alliances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their talk of &quot;the grand march to state house&quot; and &quot;Moi must go&quot; have come to be viewed by the general population as efforts aimed at self-serving aggrandizement at the expense of issue-centered mechanisms that address the myriads of problems facing Kenyans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their call for constitutional reforms emanate from the fear of imminent defeat and they would like to explain it away by blaming the constitution,&quot; says Mwanzi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say the majority of opposition supporters feel let down by those they expected to effect a system of check and balances on the governing party.  And dissolution continues to grow as the opposition continue to be divided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent remarks in London by the British high commissioner to Kenya, Simon Heman, that President Moi was poised to win the 1997 election drew the wrath of opposition party operatives who viewed the remarks as biased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, given the disarray among the opposition parties and the absence of direction, indications are that the ruling party is poised to win again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Zimbabweans are concerned that the ruling Zanu-PF party is amending the constitution willy-nilly, and is trampling on human rights and eroding judicial independence in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since independence in 1980, Zanu-PF, which has 147 MPs out of a total 150, has amended the constitution 13 times.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 14th amendment has just been submitted to parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Minister Emmerson Munangagwa responded to opposition over the latest proposed amendment by saying, &quot;We (Zanu-PF) make constitutional changes that are necessary to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last five years, the Constitution has been amended four times to reverse decisions made by the supreme court, notably in cases where the government had previously lost in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tendal Biti, a human rights lawyer, says: &quot;in a democracy, the erosion of the rule of law is demoralising and unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to eroding the rule of law, the government is accused of having eroded human rights protected under the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A University of Zimbabwe Constitutional law lecturer, Welshman Noube, says: &quot;I think it's the height of madness to amend the Bill of Rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest proposal is an amendment to section II of the constitution the &quot; pillar of Zimbabwe's human and individual rights&quot;, Noube says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendment imposes strict regulations on foreign spouses who will no longer get automatic citizenship.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Madagascar has called a snap election, pitting the island's impeached populist president against parliament in a struggle with roots in a bizarre effort to revive a decrepit economy with loans from drug traffickers and scam artists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madagascar's former military ruler, in exile in France, has also said he will compete in the presidential ballot set for November 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote was called after the high court upheld parliament's impeachment of President Albert Zafy for exceeding his powers, and ordered his removal from office until elections have been held. Zafy said he is the victim of a constitutional coup and would not be prevented from regaining office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not a murderer and I have not committed any crimes. I therefore intend to stand for re-election and nobody can stop me from doing so,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zafy (70) overturned 17 years of military rule when he handily won the presidency in 1993. But he swiftly ran into a political mire over Madagascar's economy which was reeling from mismanagement by the former Marxist- turned-reformist regime. The island is $4-billion in debt and unable even to meet interest payments. It has the lowest international credit rating possible, putting it on a par with Zaire where the formal economy barely exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is divided over how to handle the crisis. Madagascar's former prime minister led one faction in favour of following an International Monetary Fund austerity plan, without which the country found it all but impossible to borrow money through the normal channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zafy rejected the social cost of large public- sector job and service cuts as too high on an island where nearly half the children suffer retarded growth or acute malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the World Bank refused new loans, officials sought alternative sources of money with the president's backing. The administration called it &quot;parallel financing&quot;. The World Bank called it money laundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other deals, the Malagasy government attempted to borrow $450-million through the bank account of a goat farmer in Texas. The World Bank warned Madagascar the money was being laundered by drug cartels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a series of other bizarre schemes -- involving an array of characters claiming to be anyone from the board of governors of The United Nations of America to a relative of the Prince of Liechtenstein -- Madagascar's treasury appeared to lose more money than it gained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ensuing political battles, Zafy tried to fire the prime minister.  Parliament said he could not. A year ago the president called a referendum on the issue, which he won handily among poverty-striken islanders fearful of yet more austerity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislature responded by impeaching the president on the grounds that the referendum and subsequent dismissal of the prime minister were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zafy's principal rival in the election will be the speaker of parliament, Richard Andriamanjato, a former ally who led the charge for impeachment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week Zafy accused the speaker of using the crisis to further his own presidential ambitions and of pursuing an alternative parallel financing plan by agreeing to a $300-million scheme to dump toxic waste in Madagascar.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africans who are plundering Angola's diamond fields have no respect for the country's laws or Angolan sovereignty, according to officials in Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighteen South Africans were imprisoned for eight days due to an &quot; unfortunate mistake&quot; by the Angolan government over their visas and the mining equipment they had imported, the group's leader, Cicero Combrink, said on their return to Johannesburg International Airport on Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combrink said the charges against them had been dropped, and this was confirmed by Angolan diplomat Jorge Morais. Combrink said he planned to return to Angola in &quot;10 days&quot; to continue mining in northern Angola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are unconfirmed reports that another 10 South Africans are being held hostage by Angolan soldiers at a diamond concession on the Chicapa River in northern Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African miners, like many others, have been lured to Angola by the promise of untold wealth contained in the fabled diamond fields of northern Angola. According to a statement by the Angolan government, the 18 were rounded up as part of Angola's &quot;Cancer Two&quot; operation, which is intended to halt the illegal arrival of South Africans and their equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were originally charged with illegally importing mining equipment, illegally working in the country and three of contravening flight regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combrink, from Vereeniging, was formerly a part-owner of an unregistered South African company called the Esperanze Group, which went bankrupt earlier this year. Combrink was trading under a new company called Cacom Diamonds, at the time of his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to his wife, Anel Combrink, Combrink had earlier this year mined a concession under the name of Esperanze at Dundo in Lunda Norte, in a venture with partners he eventually sacked. Lunda Norte, which borders Zaire, and Lunda Sul, are known as Angola's &quot;diamond provinces&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concession yielded few diamonds and Combrink abandoned the project and his equipment, and returned to South Africa, where he formed the new Cacom Diamonds company with four directors, one of them himself and one his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife said this week that Cacom Diamonds had recently formed a partnership with an Angolan company called Sicofal, which owns diamond concessions in Lunda Norte. One of Sicofal's directors is an Angolan general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combrink left South Africa early this month with 14 employees and investors for the Angolan border. He crossed into Angola from Namibia but got no further than Ongiva in Kunene province, 30km from the border, where he was arrested by the Angolan authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Anel Combrink, their troubles began after her husband provided information about a former partner, Malcolm McAlpine, to the Angolan embassy in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolan authorities have now refused permission for McAlpine, who is well-known in diamond circles, to enter the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of foreigners, including many South Africans, have taken advantage of ineffective government controls to illegally enter the country, often using light aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 2 000 foreigners have been expelled in the last eight weeks, their warehouses closed and goods worth millions of rands confiscated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Johannesburg-based diamond miner who was employed by Combrink as a diver (many of the gems are recovered from Angola's diamondiferous riverbeds), who asked not to be named, South Africans often put up the costs for the expensive mining equipment that is needed and go into partnership with Angolans who are legally able to obtain mining rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diver said South Africans seeking the riches of Lunda Norte often entered the province with a 30-day temporary visa, but were always forced to surrender their passports on arrival by border authorities. He said they were then approached by Angolans and promised permanent work permits which invariably failed to materialise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diver said that sooner or later the South African miners were forced to leave Angola either because they lacked the correct immigration documentation, ran out of funds, or their equipment was seized by the authorites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The South Africans are like the Russians in Kinshasha and have little regard for Angolan sovereignty and common law,&quot; claimed Paulo Carmo, Angolan airlines' operations manager in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the prospective miners often flew into Angola with false flight plans, then faked emergency landings at airfields near remote mining towns.  Once on the ground, Carmo claimed the pilots offloaded their cargoes, often without paying tax or customs duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to new legislation, all aircraft will now have to report to Luanda before travelling further in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in Pretoria there is little sympathy for the plight of South Africans who venture illegally into Angola in the search for diamonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Foreign Affairs Department representative said that South Africans often did business in Angola without informing the department of their whereabouts or business intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the South African authorities only heard from the miners when they got into trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many would-be investors have accused the South African government of not warning them about the difficulties of operating in Angola, the representative said, &quot;how can we if they do not tell us they are there?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa's Catholic bishops intend challenging the liberalisation of the country's abortion laws in the Consitutional Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference (SACBC) has instructed Durban advocate Noel Pistorius to prepare its case and will launch its challenge should the Termination of Pregnancy Bill be passed into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lobbying by the Catholic Church is understood to have included President Nelson Mandela himself, who was visited informally recently by Archbishop Wilfrid Napier of Durban, Archbishop Lawrence Henry of Cape Town and Bishop Louis Ndlovu of Swaziland -- the president and two vice-presidents of the SACBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on Monday, the day before the Bill was tabled in Parliament, a six- member SACBC delegation led by Napier met African National Congress national executive committee members, including Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other ANC members present were Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma, ANC Deputy Secretary General Cheryl Carolus, Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus and Mpuma-langa Premier Matthew Phosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SACBC delegation asked the ANC to allow its members in Parliament to vote according to their consciences on the Bill, in a free vote. ANC policy, however -- spelt out in its election manifesto -- unequivocally backs women's right to safe, legal abortions, and the ANC's national executive committee (NEC) recently took the position that its members must vote in line with policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Christian and Muslim ANC MPs and others who oppose abortion on moral grounds, this presents a dilemma. When it comes to the vote, there could be many empty seats as MPs find themselves having to attend to urgent constituency business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's parliamentary caucus has yet to discuss the issue. &quot;If the NEC has taken a position, the caucus must follow the line,&quot; said Mbeki's parliamentary counsellor, Mavivi Manzini. &quot;If there are problems, the matter must be referred back to the NEC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know there are ANC MPs with differing views,&quot; said the SACBC's associate secretary general, Father Emil Blaser. &quot;It is such an important issue of conscience -- we feel there should not be a whipped vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was unhappy that ANC officials at the meeting had not informed the SACBC delegation that the Bill was to be tabled the next day. &quot;They would surely have known, yet they did not say a word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Bill was passed, the SACBC would go to the Consitutional Court and argue against it in terms of the Constitution's guarantee of the right to life, Blaser said. &quot;As far as the church is concerned, life begins at conception and ends with natural death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the church, which ranked as the largest Christian denomination in South Africa, with between 3,5-million and four million members, might consider a joint Constitutional Court challenge with the National Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP this week said it would oppose provisions in the Bill that allow for abortion on demand in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Sheila Camerer, NP representative on women's issues, said the party would take the issue to the Constitutional Court &quot;if necessary&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blaser said &quot;even the status quo&quot; was preferable to what the new Bill was proposing. At present, abortions are allowed under certain conditions. But red tape and lack of access to doctors means the current law is discriminatory against the majority of women. Many end up resorting to unsafe backstreet abortions. Many die, while treating women who have had illegal procedures costs the state millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are among the reasons why the Bill has been welcomed by abortion- reform campaigners. It provides for abortions within a health-care framework that will see the service provided across the country, at primary and secondary health-care facilities, not just state hospitals, as is the case at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill will be gazetted for public comment and the National Assembly's Health Portfolio Committee must hold hearings before it goes to Parliament for approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts were this week under way to arrange for the Bill to be dealt with during the last session of Parliament this year. However, a brace of criminal justice Bills has been marked top priority by the Cabinet and Parliament must deal with them first in what will be a very short session.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa's biggest student body, the South African Students' Congress (Sasco) is sliding in popularity just as it celebrates its fifth anniversary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent campus polls show Sasco is losing its grip on students' representative councils (SRCs) -- turf it had secured over the last few years at most tertiary institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections are still taking place on some campuses, but results so far indicate the balance of power is tilting in favour of &quot;born-again&quot; Christians and independents at traditionally black universities. At formerly white, English institutions, such as the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) and the University of Natal (UN) Sasco has lost the majority it held before.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasco national president David Makhura said many factors, among them the new political order, have contributed to a change in voting patterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Makhura argues that SRCs were not a fair barometer of whether Sasco was losing student support, he concedes &quot;in some cases Sasco may not be taking seriously the social interests of students, such as 'bashes'. And that is why when it comes to elections they tend to elect socialites -- people who throw parties and are well-liked for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the University of the North last year Sasco lost heavily to the Student Christian Movement (SCM), winning only five out of 19 seats -- after having a majority on the SRC for years. Last month at UCT, Sasco gained only two out of 15 seats with the Christians again doing better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makhura is not happy with the situation: &quot;They (SCM) did not fight for democratic SRCs. They did not even dare to participate then (during apartheid) but now they are reaping the benefits. However it is their right to participate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He criticised &quot;born-agains&quot; saying they did not have programmes which mattered to students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What worries us is that sometimes it (the election of SCM candidates and independents) becomes a setback for the transformation forums,&quot; because those elected were unable to &quot;make effective input&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makhura said corruption at some of the formerly black institutions dented Sasco's image. But he attributed Sasco's poor showing at institutions like Wits, UN and UCT to the emergence of &quot;elite&quot; black students not affected by issues traditionally taken up by Sasco such as exclusion of students for financial reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Sasco national deputy general secretary Sidney Modiba, who is a student at UN's Durban campus, agreed there were more &quot;elite, affluent African students, including Indians and coloureds. The issues we (Sasco) are raising are more oriented towards the poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the University of the Western Cape, where many students are from disadvantaged backgrounds, Sasco took all 12 seats in last month's elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Public Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya has had to bang heads together in the Presidential Review Commission -- the body appointed by President Nelson Mandela to investigate transformation in the public service - - to get it to do some work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before this week, the multi-million rand commission met only four times since it was inaugurated in March. And while there is evidence the commission has belatedly squared up to the enormous challenge ahead, MPs are concerned it has been fiddling while the demoralised public service burns.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission must, by the end of its tenure, provide a medium-term and long-term plan for restructuring the public service. This is crucial to save the African National Congress's promises of delivery before elections in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its defence, the commission says it has spent the past six months developing a business plan, identifying personnel and agreeing to an operating budget of R18,5-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the commissioners, Professor Fanie Cloete of the University of Stellenbosch, told MPs at a parliamentary portfolio meeting this week that progress had been held up by complicated negotiations with donors who had refused to release promised funds until its business plan had been refined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in the public service said problems with donors developed partly as a result of the unfortunate negotiating style of the commission's chairman, Professor Bax Nomvete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also pointed out that much time-wasting has been caused by infighting among commission staff. Particular acrimony developed around Nomvete, whose authoritarian manner demoralised commissioners and staff, and it was only after a meeting with Skweyiya and some &quot;hard talking&quot; in early August that difficulties were patched up and &quot;everybody kissed and made up&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete has since acquired an official adviser from the public service, Professor Patrick Fitzgerald.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the commission has been meeting in Pretoria, working out its strategy of investigating the public service. This includes going to every government department in the country, evaluating its performance and reporting back. An interim report will be presented to Mandela at the end of next March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ANC MP said sceptically: &quot;It may well be that they do get down to work, but if their past performance is anything to go by, they need pressure on them to know they have to deliver.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Truth commission investigators have been left frustrated by an &quot;intervention&quot; of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi which they say gave former police generals a strategic breather before they face tough questioning on apartheid crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission is also under fire from within its own ranks for having acceded to the political intervention, which some say could create an impression the commission is not as autonomous as it should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mbeki this week said the initiative had originated with the commission itself, while the generals put the blame on the truth body -- saying it had caused the delay as it has not yet responded to a plea for certain assurances before all can be told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian learnt this week that four of apartheid South Africa's police commissioners have handed a written submission to the truth body. The submission was voluntary, which was one of the terms of a deal in which the body dropped its plans to subpoena them and other senior officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But truth commissioner Dumisa Ntsebeza, who heads the commission's investigative unit, this week slammed the generals' submission as a &quot; philosophical&quot; treatise which did not live up to the commission's expectations to be given at least some particulars on specific instances of serious human rights abuse. &quot;I certainly did not get the feeling we got what we wanted,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The submission is under embargo and the contents are to become public only when the generals appear in person. No date has been set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's original plan last month was to subpoena seven senior police officers, including former commissioners Johan Coetzee, Hennie de Witt, Mike Geldenhuys and Johan van der Merwe, to answer questions about apartheid crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntsebeza said the strategy had been to hear at least some of the generals' testimony concurrently with that of former Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock, who took the stand in mitigation of his own sentence in the Pretoria Supreme Court this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigative unit believed the threat of De Kock telling all in court about his former masters would have encouraged them to give detailed and truthful answers to the commission. Had they given less than the full truth -- De Kock's evidence could have given useful tips on that -- they might have prejudiced their chances of successful amnesty applications later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal Mbeki helped broker after a request by Mufamadi gave the generals a breather to prepare their submission on their own terms -- and pass the crucial time frame of De Kock's evidence. Said Ntsebeza: &quot;The generals did not want to be put on the spot; they first wanted to hear what De Kock said.  Then they could trim their sails to suit the wind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntsebeza hinted at unhappiness within the commission that political intervention had been allowed. &quot;There is something to be said about the correctness of a criticism that may be levelled at the commission that it may ... appear to have been influenced, however well-meaning (the intervention) may have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another commission official said Mbeki's intervention had been &quot; extraordinary&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 29 Mbeki met the commission's head, Desmond Tutu, and national director of investigations, Glen Goosen. The view was forwarded that a non- confrontational approach would be more likely to succeed, as the generals' co- operation was necessary to encourage lower-ranking security force personnel to apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later generals Van der Merwe, Geldenhuys and Coetzee met Tutu, his deputy Alex Boraine, Ntsebeza and Goosen. At a media conference afterwards, Tutu said it had been agreed the subpoenas would not be issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the thrust of Mufa-madi and Mbeki's intervention had been &quot;that these former commissioners and other high-ranking police officers were ready to co-operate with the commission and (they) thought the use of subpoenas would be counter-productive ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were saying -- and we have agreed -- that they would want to voluntarily make an ... omnibus submission ... Then there would be a supplementary list ... in which they would list certain incidents -- they spoke about, at this stage, 50 or so incidents where they would be able to speak in general terms initially.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu warned that while it would be mostly &quot;generalised&quot;, if there was nothing more specific, &quot;we will obviously not be satisfied&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki's spokesman, Ricky Naidoo, this week said Mbeki's intervention was only another step in a process initiated by the truth body itself. It had earlier approached the government, through Mufamadi and Defence Minister Joe Modise, to encourage former security force members to appear voluntarily before the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consequently, the ministers met (the generals) to put forward the commission's request. At these meetings they agreed to appear, voluntarily, before the commission. These ministers then requested Mbeki to meet Tutu ...  It was agreed at the meeting ... that the issuing of subpoenas was entirely the prerogative of the commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A top officer close to the former police commissioners this week said it was not true that their approach through Mbeki had been merely in reaction to the subpoenas. There had been a series of meetings long before the subpoenas were mooted, laying the groundwork for the generals to encourage their former subordinates to make their own approaches to the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it had been proposed that a broadly philosophical document be submitted by the generals to the commission, contextualising the apart-heid struggle from the old South African Police point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer charged the truth body itself was holding up the signal that the generals would give their subordinates to confess, as it had not yet replied to a request that legal obstacles be dealt with first. One concern was that operatives who confessed to involvement in cross-border operations would not be safe from prosecution in their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the generals also needed assurances that security force members would not lose their right to state legal representation, should a matter come to trial in ordinary courts, when a confession is made to the commission.  At present security force members only qualify for state legal representation when they plead not guilty, which they cannot do if they have already confessed to the truth body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer confirmed the generals had mooted the possibility of helping the commission get closer to the truth in an estimated 50 cases, and was ready to put out a signal to former subordinates to confess. But he said that could only be done once the assurances had been given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to act as a catalyst, but we have to be convinced first ... We don't have the military authority anymore that we can say (to former subordinates), 'Left, right, left, right, you go there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A delegation from Indonesian-occupied East Timor left South Africa this week with an assurance from President Nelson Mandela that donations to the African National Congress by the Indonesian government would not make &quot;a hostage&quot; of South African foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jorge Ramos Horta, who represents the East Timorese resistance movement, said Mandela gave the assurance during a &quot;very frank&quot; 30-minute meeting which took place in the bedroom of Mandela's Houghton home on Sunday, where he was recovering from knee surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation, which came as guests of the ANC, left ruffled feathers in the Indonesian embassy following an incident at an international fair in Pretoria on Saturday, which resulted in the Indonesian ambassador lodging a protest with the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At issue was the warm welcome extended to the East Timorese delegation by a DFA official at the fair, organised by the Junior Foreign Service Officers' Club and Pretoria University's rag committee. Ramos Horta was given the opportunity to speak and the Indonesians' affront was compounded when a club official, owing to a misunderstanding, lowered the flag flying above the Indonesian stall.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign ministry representative Pieter Swanepoel confirmed that on Tuesday the Indonesian ambassador met Tutu Mazibuko, deputy director general in charge of Asia and the Middle East. Mazibuko stressed that the event had not been an official DFA function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's diplomatic relations with Indonesia -- - which annexed the former Portuguese colony by force in 1975, sparking a struggle for independence which has seen some 200 000 East Timorese die -- is one of the more glaring contradictions of South Africa's post-apartheid foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramos Horta said Mandela explained to the delegation during the meeting that he had not raised the issue of the East Timor people's struggle when he first visited Indonesia to solicit funds for the ANC's election campaign as he was not well informed about the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the elections the ANC still needed money so he went a second time.  He said the donations would not make South African foreign policy a hostage and said that he did raise the issue of East Timor. He said he had a lot of objections to his going from within the ANC and from non-governmental organisations,&quot; Ramos Horta said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC MP Raymond Suttner, chair of the National Assembly's foreign affairs portfolio committee, said: &quot;A number of us feel quite strongly in support of the right of the people of East Timor to self- determination and about the human rights violations in Indonesia. It is important the president did stress that the fact we received donations will not determine our foreign policy in this area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation gave Mandela a letter from imprisoned East Timorese resistance leader Xanana Gusmao. Mandela said he would reply to it and handed over a copy of his biography, Long Walk to Freedom, to give to Gusmao with the inscription: &quot;With best wishes to an outstanding freedom fighter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramos Horta said the delegation had asked Mandela to speak to United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ahead of the next round of talks between Indonesia and Portugal in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For us it is the last round if Indonesia does not want to come with a more flexible position,&quot; said Ramos Horta. &quot;We want Indonesia to agree to release all prisoners and stop the torture. In return, we would call a moratorium on guerrilla activity and street demonstrations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela displayed &quot;enormous understanding and real sympathy&quot;, Ramos Horta said. &quot;We leave with complete satisfaction, partly because we did not come expecting too much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation understood the conflicting interests which had to be juggled to further South Africa's own agenda, even if this meant the ANC &quot;taking certain steps that could be shocking when looking at its position on human rights&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential representative Parks Mankahlana confirmed the meeting took place. &quot;It would be inappropriate at this stage to make any statement about the content of the discussion because of the sensitivity of the issues involved,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - On the eve of a four-day convention aimed at mapping a new direction for the party, Pan Africanist Congress president Clarence Makwetu has declared his willingness to continue to lead the organisation and his confidence of members' support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's likely the Convention of Africanists, at Vista Mamelodi this weekend, will see intense lobbying.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dissatisfaction with Makwetu's leadership within and outside the party was what prompted a high- powered group of African intellectuals, professionals, trade unionists and businessmen to organise the convention in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makwetu's unpopularity extends right up into the PAC's highest structures, but what supporters he has are fighting a desperate battle to keep him in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An expected 500 delegates, including members of breakaway PAC groupings such as the Revolutionary Watchdogs, will discuss ways of putting the PAC back on track and turning it into a left-of-centre party promoting Africanist ideals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key challenges for the party are reorganising its structures and chaotic finances, discussing its leadership and forging new policies. Decisions taken will have to be ratified by the PAC at its December conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convention convenor Ike Mafole said there was no vendetta against Makwetu -- but at the same time, no one was indispensable. &quot;There is a place for the PAC as the only legitimate opposition in this country. But we need to get our act together,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The convention will bring together people of divergent views, some favouring capitalism, some socialism. The fundamental aim is unity. People should be able to express views without fear or favour.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale this week refused to bail Deputy President Thabo Mbeki out of his embarrassment over allegations that he had been behind a drugs probe into Sexwale after the 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the process, Sexwale and National Party leader FW de Klerk emerged unlikely bedfellows in a shared view that Mbeki had initiated an attempt to damage the political career of his own African National Congress colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claims surfaced in press reports last weekend that in mid-1994 Mbeki had asked De Klerk, who at the time headed a Cabinet committee responsible for intelligence, whether there was any evidence in state files connecting Sexwale to the drugs trade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter dated August 19 1994, Sexwale wrote to De Klerk questioning the probe. The Sunday Independent published excerpts of a tape recording of a meeting a month later between De Klerk and Sexwale, where De Klerk told Sexwale the probe had not begun with himself -- and that &quot;there were long knives out for you&quot; from within the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well-placed members of Sexwale's circle this week confirmed Sexwale refused, after publication of the article, a request from Mbeki to engage in a damage- control exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said Mbeki had asked Sexwale that they put out a joint statement, pinning the origins of the drugs probe on De Klerk. Sexwale declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, a close ally of Mbeki's, came to the rescue with a statement saying the drugs probe had originated with a 1994 election speech by De Klerk in which he said he had information on Sexwale that would have him &quot;running all the way to Japan&quot; -- and that Mbeki merely wanted to establish whether the speech was a reference to drug allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sexwale's liaison officer Sefako Nyaka this week refused to confirm that Sexwale had declined Mbeki's request. But he did say Sexwale would not take a position. &quot;We are not saying Thabo approached De Klerk, and neither are we saying Thabo did not approach De Klerk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Sexwale's circle claimed the tiff had its origins in the intense jockeying for position within the ANC after the elections -- a time when Sexwale was still regarded by many as a serious contender to become future president. They said Sexwale believed the drugs probe had been an attempt by Mbeki to see if it was not possible to rid himself of a competitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk this week confirmed the version as published at the weekend. He said: &quot;It is an untruth that I took any initiative in this connection, or that I approached Deputy President Thabo Mbeki ... I was requested by Mr Mbeki to determine whether there was any information on record with reference to such allegations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk also said: &quot;It is untrue that I, as Mr Sydney Mufamadi alleges, linked in any way whatsoever a remark -- that Mr Sexwale would move to Tokyo - - to such information in my possession ... What is indeed true is that I said in Johannesburg on April 16 1994 that if the results in the PWV area were announced ... Sexwale would want to move to Tokyo ... At that stage I was blissfully unaware of any allegations connecting Mr Sexwale to drug trading ..  .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ANC should, rather than blaming me by means of untruths, look for the culprits in their own ranks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Health Department Director General Olive Shisana has personally petitioned outgoing British high commissioner Sir Anthony Reeve more than once this year in a bid to stop South African doctors finding employment in British state hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there are rumours of diplomatic agitation behind the scenes at Shisana's forthrightness, British diplomats say there was no anguish in the latest meeting where they were able to express sympathy with her problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative of the British High Commission, Andrew Noble, said the British government was unable to tell the National Health System (NHS) who to employ, but it had sent a message to the NHS to go &quot;softly, softly&quot; on employing South African doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a subject we have been discussing with the department all year ...  and we have drawn the attention of Dr Shisana to organisations such as the British Experts' Service Organisation and the Voluntary Service Organisation to provide volunteer doctors for the rural areas. However, we genuinely believe that a free flow of doctors internationally is good,&quot; said Noble.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this flow that Shisana and Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma wish to stem. However, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said this week that the most popular destinations for emigrating doctors were Australia and New Zealand, followed by the Americas and Europe. Six more doctors immigrated to South Africa than emigrated last year. Mbeki said 23% fewer doctors emigrated last year than the year before. Shisana was abroad, and could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this week the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Health instructed the Interim Medical and Dental Council of South Africa (IMDCSA) to research its own proposal that medical graduates do two extra years of vocational training, saying there was a need for deeper investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a day of public hearings, speaker after speaker said that there had not been sufficient consultation on the proposal and criticised the assumptions that underpinned it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vocational training issue and the doctors' brain- drain have become twinned in the minds of many, who see the training as a mechanism to stop young graduates from leaving South Africa before giving something back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was almost unanimous agreement that the medical curriculum needed to be revised to suit South African needs and community service was sorely needed in some areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-conscription activist Dr Ivan Toms recommended compulsory community service at the meeting, on behalf of the National Progressive Primary Health Care Network:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was not one of those doctors who went abroad to escape conscription. I stayed at home and went to jail ... but at least with the old system of conscription young doctors were conscripted into military hospitals and even though the system was wrong, at least they were able to provide some sort of service to the poor in rural areas. This is not happening anymore. We have to get doctors into those areas and community service can help us do this,&quot; Toms said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically it was British-trained Dr David McCoy, working in rural Kwazulu- Natal, who gave the most vivid description of how bad the situation was in rural South Africa:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the end of 1992, I came from England to work in a 400-bed rural hospital. I joined six other foreign doctors. Together with a local, non- medical staff, we were charged with looking after the health of about 180 000 people. In England, it is normal for 180 000 people to have access to well over 300 doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several patients died in theatre or in the wards due to clinical mistakes or misjudgments, not because of negligence, but because of inexperience. I often performed surgical operations on patients with an open textbook in front of me,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The sale of the South African Broadcasting Corporation's Radio Jacaranda, a snip at R70-million, was the bargain of the century. The winning bidders own a station which reaches five provinces and has as many listeners as the far more expensive Gauteng-based Highveld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Jacaranda is stress-free wireless for a huge, fiercely loyal, largely white listenership. Not much news, lots of blasts from the past. A South African music quota mostly made up of the odd croon from Ge Korsten and a DJ style which is safely non-political.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lucky winner, with a bid R20-million less than that of the opposition -- Naledi -- is Newshelf 71 (no relation to Newshelf 63 which won the more glamorous Radio Highveld bid, except for a common lawyer).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the announcement, Newshelf 71 was the arch outsider: even its members considered themselves out of the running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Manderstam (South African), representing Newshelf 71's foreign component, seemed thunderstruck by the decision. &quot;I am very surprised but of course very happy.&quot; Manderstam is no stranger to radio and controls 140 stations worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more popular, Pretoria-based &quot;black empowered&quot; Naledi consortium members -- equally surprised though less happy -- were rendered speechless by the result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent Broadcasting Commission's (IBA) Wednesday announcement on Jacaranda was so controversial it almost over-shadowed the results of the more-publicised Highveld bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highveld went to Newshelf 63 for a whopping R320- million and had both Stan Katz (Newshelf 63/Primedia bigwig) and Minister Jay Naidoo bursting with glee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first glance the IBA decisions appear highly conservative. A case of pandering to the rich guys as usual. However, on closer inspection the choices perhaps make better sense. The IBA's handling of the first privatisation deal in South African history had to ensure the most viable options for broadcasting were secured, provided of course certain criteria were met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newshelf 63 met those criteria as it had the largest proportion of historically disadvantaged shareholders. It also offered its black partners the cheapest money at a 11% interest rate. These partners, which include trade unions and a women's group, have got themselves a huge slice of the action at Highveld without investing a cent, so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jacaranda winners also boast the largest historically disadvantaged component, with New Africa Investments -- the powerful new owners of Johnnic - - having a 65.1% shareholding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newshelf 71 is also the only consortium with a foreign investor. The involvement of French broadcasting giants European Development International should guarantee access to a highly sophisticated network of foreign news, invaluable expertise in digital broadcasting and a sumptuous injection of French francs. Not even Stan Katz has all that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's decisions will certainly shift perceptions of the IBA as simply good samaritan. Perhaps more of a blow for idealism than radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The further controversy regarding the matter of proceeds from the sale being snatched from the Sing Corporation and going instead to the government elicited comment from SABC radio chief Govin Reddy. Relieved that Naidoo had already left the venue, Reddy denounced the decision, saying that SABC would be badly hit by the loss of revenue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Dutch ambassador in South Africa, Eduard Roell, has been reassigned as ambassador to Belgium because of an alleged extramarital affair, months before the official end of his term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a leading Dutch newspaper, NRC Handelsblad, Minister of Foreign Affairs Hans van Mierlo was forced into this decision by The Netherlands's Queen Beatrix, who is a strong supporter of traditional family values, although his affair actually ended more than two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The queen will be visiting South Africa from September 30 and made it clear during talks with the minister in preparation for the tour that she was not prepared to share the stage with the &quot;philandering&quot; Roell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutionally the Dutch queen is not allowed to intervene in diplomatic appointments. In fact her role is almost totally symbolic -- she is only supposed to sign government decisions into law. Her public speeches are authorised by the Cabinet and are supposed to represent the Dutch government's viewpoints. But sources at the NRC Handelsblad said that Beatrix insisted Roell leave South Africa before her visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Beatrix made her opinion repeatedly known, Van Mierlo, a member of the liberal democratic party (who has himself lived with a girlfriend for many years), gave in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to NRC Handelsblad, Beatrix became irritated when Roell left his wife in 1992 when he was appoined to Pretoria, and began a new life with an old girlfriend. But then minister of foreign affairs Pieter Kooymans -- ironically a member of the conservative christian democratic party -- rejected Beatrix's objections to the appointment. He, however, made it clear to Roell that he should avoid a public scandal, inform his diplomatic staff confidentially and that he was not allowed to take his girlfriend to official gatherings with members of the South African government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a source in South Africa, Roell's wife had a stroke not long after the initial unofficial separation, and the ambassador broke up with his girlfriend and cared for his wife after she arrived in South Africa in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unlikely Beatrix thought that Roell was still living with his girlfriend when she ordered his transfer to Brussels. But her personal involvement in the matter has caused a debate that is sweeping through the Netherlands on the constitutional dos and don'ts of the House of Orange.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Evidence in Colonel Eugene de Kock's mitigation hearing suggests clandestine support from the police for Inkatha paramilitary units to attack ANC supporters in the early 1990s -- long after the movement was unbanned -- was not a maverick operation by members of the Vlakplaas unit for personal gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock told the court that he was tasked to supply a batch of 100 home- made shotguns by at least four police generals -- including Krappies Engelbrecht, Nick van Rensburg, Basie Smit and a General Steyn who headed up the security police in Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The colonel said Smit personally approved the budget for the manufacture of the weapons and General Steyn -- with assistance from Colonel Louis Botha, one of the accused in the Magnus Malan murder trial -- had helped to distribute the weapons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After first supplying the home-made shotguns, demands from KwaZulu-Natal for more sophisticated weapons including AK-47 rifles, limpet mines and RPG- 7s increased. De Kock says he then personally supplied truckloads of hand grenades, light machine guns, mines, ammunition and AK-47s to senior Inkatha officials including Senator Phillip Powell and former minister CJ Mtetwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock suggested Powell was a key liaison officer in the conspiracy by military intelligence and covert police units to arm Inkatha paramilitaries.  He said the senator had first worked for covert Stratcom units of the security police and became an agent for a military intelligence front company called Longreach before moving over to work closely with Inkatha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The colonel said he received no payment for supplying the weapons or for training members of Inkatha's self- protection units at a secret camp in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In later testimony, De Kock alleged that General Steyn's office once asked for the whole of the Vlakplaas unit to travel down to Durban so that it could take part in a joint attack with Inkatha members on an ANC &quot;facility&quot; in Chesterville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another occasion General Nick van Rensburg, said De Kock, asked the Vlakplaas commander to fill in a false claim form for R20 000 so that the funds could be used to &quot;manufacture assegais for the Zulus&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Williamson, who set up military intelligence's Longreach operation, saidit was probable Senator Powell did work as an MI agent and possible that he had been seconded to Inkatha as part of the wider strategy to convert the Zulu movement into a paramilitary bulwark against the ANC. He added that security force support for Inkatha had begun with top- level and ongoing contact between General Johan Coetzee, former head of security police and SAP commissioner in the 1980s, and Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The support referred to by De Kock was simply the later stages of a wide-ranging strategy that had been set in place in the early 1980s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It was a balmy autumn afternoon back in 1993 and Eugene de Kock was sitting, as arranged, on the terrace of the Centurion Park Hotel in Pretoria with a bulging moon bag next to the beer in front of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was our second meeting and I was hoping, naively it turns out, that because the Vlakplaas commander was involved in a bitter dispute with his police superiors at the time he would talk about their role in fomenting &quot; third force&quot; violence. But instead of giving away state secrets, the colonel did two things that epitomise the conundrum he has posed for the court and country this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took a state-of-the-art Glock pistol from the bag and, with the boyish smile that he displayed all through his testimony in court, explained that it wasn't really an assassin's weapon and he only used it on the shooting range.  And when he heard I was about to leave for Greece and was thinking of visiting Bosnia, he offered some fatherly advice: don't travel in an armoured car because it &quot;will cook you&quot; if hit by an RPG-7; &quot;if you take a head wound ask someone to shoot you because then it's not worth surviving&quot;; and if you get into real trouble ask your wife to call me and I'll come and fetch you.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experience left a set of deeply ambivalent feelings. I was horrified to handle a gun that had probably been used to murder some of the colonel's victims yet attracted by the man's genial manner, disturbed by his professional capacity for violence but beguiled by his offer to help in times of stress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock's uncanny ability to both shock and charm is a theme that was played out over and again when this complex man had the judge and his pair of assessors, as well as most of the packed gallery, on the edge of their chairs in room DG3 of the Pretoria Supreme Court this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was, for example, a moment when -- after a riveting account of cross- border operations into Lesotho and Botswana in which he blew houses and buildings to smithereens, abducted ANC operatives, pushed getaway cars over cliffs and shot men in the head -- Justice Willem Van der Merwe asked De Kock what he and his men got in return. &quot;Ag just a good handshake and a little braai.&quot; It was a reply that broke the judge's stern countenance into the hint of a smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another occasion the colonel explained how one of his agents had complained that Winnie Mandela turned him into a sex slave after he had infiltrated her gang of township toughs. &quot;We did not believe him but Captain Anton Pretorius who listened to the tapes made in Mrs Mandela's house said he was a man of Olympian standards who could satisfy any woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were more grins on the bench and they were eradicated by the testimony that came seconds later. The Vlakplaas man had apparently killed three policemen during his time with Mandela. &quot;He was taken to Penge mine. I shot him myself. When it came to the part where his body was to be blown up, I walked away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At tea time on Wednesday two petite woman rushed up to the dock. They chatted to the colonel for a while, hugged him and each kissed him on the cheek before he went down, flushing slightly, to the isolation of the cells below. It was difficult not to feel sorry for the man. &quot;Can you believe he is just a killer?&quot; said the person behind me as we shuffled out of the gallery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the central question that underlies the split response in most of those who heard De Kock's evidence in mitigation for the crimes he has committed. Is he a psycopathic killer, a charming version of South Africa's own Carlos the Jackal, who deserves the 200- year sentence that would normally be handed down for the combination of crimes he has been convicted of?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or was he just one of the many ordinary footsoldiers who found themselves, almost by misfortune, fighting a dirty war not of their making but doing it anyway because it had become a mundane and normal part of their working lives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The colonel's defence team led by Flip Hattingh has presented a compelling case to support the latter view. De Kock was trained to fight communists and the ANC as the enemy. He suffered repeated stress and tension after fighting bush wars in Rhodesia and South West Africa. The orders for some of his most reprehensible missions came from the highest office. Two state presidents, four cabinet ministers and more than a dozen generals have been named in this regard -- and none of them have denied the accuracy of his charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corruption and fraud, ranging from free booze in the Vlakplaas canteen to the filing of false claims worth up to R80 000 a time was the order of the day in the police force. De Kock learnt how to do these things after the generals showed him how. Even though his judgment was clouded by the trauma of what he did, and the culture he worked in, the colonel sometimes refused to carry out orders he regarded as being morally unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most shocking moments in his career was when General Gerrit Erasmus allegedly said they should shoot any uniformed policemen who may have interfered with their mission to blow up Khotso House. &quot;We decided not to shoot any policemen. If there was no other way (of dealing with their potential to leak information about the covert operation) they would simply have to become members of the security police,&quot; De Kock told the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about the evidence of gratuitous violence? He once split the skull of one of his own agents with a spade. Former Vlakplaas operatives say he beat every one of them during his stint as commander of the base -- the black members with a sjambok, the white ones with his fists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are countless incidents like these that will have to be taken into account when the court considers the colonel's plea for understanding and remission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are the gaps in his testimony, suggestions he may be protecting some of his old buddies. Did he play a role in the activities of the CCB unit that operated out of Staal Burger's hotel in Hillbrow? What about the train massacres on the Reef and the Boipatong massacre? These are issues that may be explored to test the truthfulness of the colonel when the state cross- examines him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whichever way the judge's decision goes on the question of mitigation, De Kock has already achieved another of his objectives. He has provided prima facie evidence that he is not alone in his guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of those, and they include former cabinet ministers and generals in the security forces who connived with him and gave the orders, are still in office or they are walking free. If they receive permanent amnesty, the colonel's defence team will ask, is it fair that De Kock spends the rest of his life in jail?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That question is the greatest, most central, challenge to the the country's criminal justice system that will stem from the De Kock trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To use a phrase from Hannah Arendt's book on the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem: &quot;It is one thing for the courts to ferret out criminals and murderers from their hiding places. It is another to find them prominent and flourishing in the public realm.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - If Ismail Mahomed does get the post of chief justice, there will be a sweet irony about it when he moves into the office in Bloemfontein.  When he appeared before the Appellate Division in his days as South Africa's first black silk he was forced to flee across the border before dusk in accordance with the ban on the presence of Indians overnight in the Free State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahomed's life and career have been marked by a personal struggle against racism which helped make of him probably the finest civil rights lawyer in the country. His grandparents fled the poverty of India to settle in the Transvaal as traders early this century. Mahomed himself was born in Pretoria in 1931, the oldest of six children in a devout Muslim family.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking his law degree at the University of the Witwatersrand, he joined the bar in 1957 and found himself facing ludicrous handicaps in the pursuit of his professional duties. He was unable, during his earlier years, to rent chambers in the building which housed the Johannesburg Bar, because it fell into a white area under the Group Areas Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 12 years he was forced to borrow desk-space from colleagues who were out in court, resorting to the library when there was no room available -- making it impossible at times to hold consultations with clients. Even after obtaining a Group Areas &quot;permit&quot; in 1969 he was barred for another five years from using the common room, by which time he had already become South Africa's first black SC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he turned such handicaps to professional advantage. A notorious workaholic, he became an authority on the Group Areas Act and then won recognition as one of the leading experts on administrative and constitutional law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was widely recognised as one of the most gifted orators at the South African bar, on occasion being brought in to capital cases to argue in mitigation in the belief that his silver tongue was the only chance of cheating the hangman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appointed to the South African bench in 1991, he wrote Namibia's progressive Constitution and is that country's chief justice. He underwent major heart surgery shortly before the announcement of Arthur Chaskalson's appointment to the presidency of South Africa's Constitutional Court -- a post for which Mahomed was strongly tipped. He is currently deputy president of that court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Academics and legal professionals this week described Judge Hennie van Heerden as having an exceptional legal mind with an impressive track record on the bench.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has a low profile -- several lawyers were unable to offer an opinion of him -- but most of those who had had contact with him sung his praises. A minority said Van Heerden was too staid for the job and had given several conservative decisions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One prominent legal academic said: &quot;He is austere and unrelenting. He runs a tight but traditional court.&quot; The academic, who is backing Constitutional Court deputy president Ismail Mahomed, believed Van Heerden was not the man to reform the Appellate Division, saying his appointment &quot;would probably perpetuate the marginalisation of the Appellate Division&quot;. Another academic described Van Heerden as &quot;apolitical&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Heerden, 65, was educated at the universities of Stellenbosch and the Free State, where he obtained an LLD in competition law. He became senior counsel in 1972, was appointed to the Free State Provincial Division in 1978 and the Appellate Division in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Heerden emerges as a voice of reason in academic analyses of the Appellate Division's support of State of Emergency legislation during the 1980s. In the case of United Democratic Front v State President the majority of the appeal bench -- who included Judge Joos Hefer and the then Acting Chief Justice Pierre Rabie -- refused to uphold a lower court's decision to strike down certain Emergency media regulations for their vagueness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations held, among other things, that it was subversive to incite or encourage members of the public to attend a public gathering. The regulations defined a &quot;subversive statement&quot; as one which incited or encouraged an act or omission identified by the commissioner of police as threatening the public order or prolonging the State of Emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an article called The War Against Law, published by the South African Journal of Human Rights Professor Fink Haysom and Clive Plasket said that in this case Rabie effectively held the courts had no role in checking abuses of power. He said the courts' intervention was not necessary because the executive would control its own excesses of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Rabie left open the question of whether the commissioner had uncontrolled powers, Judge Grosskopf stepped in. He made the &quot;bold assertion&quot; that the commissioner had not been given unfettered powers because the state president had called on him to clamp down on &quot;subversive statements&quot; which were easy to identify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There can be no more effective critique of this reasoning than that offered by Van Heerden in his dissenting judgment,&quot; said Haysom and Plasket.  Van Heerden held the power given to the commissioner was uncceptable, amounting to carte blanche to amend the regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said one of the regulations was defective because, among other reasons, the absence of clear guidelines meant the commissioner would be unable to decide whether his decision coincided with the opinion of the state president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The appeal court judge who called on Ismail Mahomed this week to withdraw from the race for the position of chief justice was a champion of apartheid Emergency legislation during the late 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Described as a &quot;vigorous and ingenious defender of Emergency authority&quot;, Judge Joos Hefer sat on a string of Emergency legislation appeals which backed Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hefer this week notched up another controversial chapter in his career when he said in Beeld that Mahomed should do the honourable thing and pull out of the race -- because of his inexperience on the bench, because all permanent members of the appeal court backed Judge Hennie van Heerden and because of President Nelson Mandela's controversial intervention in the selection process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hefer described the call by the National Association of Democratic lawyers (Nadel) for Van Heerden to withdraw as &quot;ridiculous and nonsense. If there is still any honour left in this game the other man should withdraw ...&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hefer featured in a 1988 article entitled The War Against Law, which appeared in the South African Journal of Human Rights. Before detailing Hefer's contribution to this war, Professor Fink Haysom -- who is now President Nelson Mandela's legal adviser -- and Clive Plasket wrote: &quot;One might recall that it was Hefer, while chief justice of the Transkei, who attempted to construe the power to detain in such extreme and generous terms that they were held to be out of line even with South African decisions. In this article we argue that Hefer's recent contribution to our administrative law jurisprudence has been that of an activist judge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Hefer's more celebrated findings during the &quot;Emergency cases&quot; was that detention without trial could be valid even if less drastic alternatives could serve the same purpose. The judge also amended the long-established principle that where there is an arrest, the onus of proving the validity of that arrest must be discharged by the arrestor. And in Castel NO v Metal and Allied Workers Union, Hefer decided that an application in terms of the 1982 Internal Security Act to organise an outside gathering could be refused without giving the applicant a right to a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1986 and 1988 the Appellate Division heard 12 cases dealing with the Emergency laws -- legislation that was effectively insulated from scrutiny by the courts and the press -- which granted massive powers to the security forces to maintain &quot;law and order&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haysom and Plasket say Hefer was picked to hear more of these cases -- nine -- than any other appeal judge during Pierre Rabie's reign as acting chief justice. (After Chief Justice Rabie reached the mandatory retirement age of 70, the government took the controversial step of making him acting chief justice for a further five years.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rabie himself was an architect of the infamous security legislation and, the authors note, &quot;must ... bear some responsibility for the composition of the courts which hear security-related matters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haysom and Plasket were not impressed with the legal reasoning and &quot; selective use of authorities&quot; Hefer employed to arrive at his decisions. They say a reader of Hefer's judgment in United Democratic Front v State President -- where the majority of the appeal judges refused to invalidate vague Emergency regulations -- &quot;will, no doubt, be struck by the extensive quotations from Professor Wade and the leading case of Short v Poole. These sources are most eloquent expositions of administrative principles and do much to argue against the propositions and conclusions found in the judgment; the contrast between the English authorities and the new brand of South African jurisprudence, as disclosed by Hefer's judgment, highlights the sorry state of this branch of the law in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Gerald Friedman, currently judge president of the Cape, made quite clear his unhappiness at making a decision in which he was bound by the precedent set by Hefer in the UDF case. When he was asked in the case of Natal Indian Congress v State President to shoot down Emergency regulations because of their unreasonableness he said he could not because of the all- embracing UDF decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Ellman, a US legal academic who wrote a book in 1992 on the role of the courts during the Emergency era and who described Hefer as a &quot;vigorous and ingenious defender of Emergency legislation&quot;, said of these cases: &quot;Most of them are decided against human rights claims, and they reflect the court's intense fear of revolutionary onslaught, and its trust (in) and sympathy for those dealing with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellman coined the phrase &quot;the Emergency team&quot; when explaining the phenomenon of how the same appeal judges popped up in those 12 Emergency cases. He said that in each of these cases at least three of the five judges were from the Emergency team -- of which Hefer was a leading light -- and that the members of the team never disagreed with each other on these cases.  Another member of the &quot;team&quot; who is still with the Appellate Division is Judge Vivier. Judge EM Grosskopf, who sat on four Emergency cases, is also still serving the appeal court. Another contraversial judge still sitting in Bloemfontein is Louis Harms, who headed the unsatisfactory commission of inquiry into security force hit squads in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hefer's decisions before becoming an appeal court judge included taking the unusual step of sentencing an ANC activist to death for high treason. During the trial the accused -- charged with planning a bombing campaign -- sang loudly to frustrate the proceedings. In his judgment, Hefer complained of &quot; provocative and contemptuous&quot; conduct. The appeal court overturned his decision to impose the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Judges across the country are taking sides in the furious controversy over who is to succeed Michael Corbett as South Africa's chief justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the most divisive rows to hit the judiciary since the 1950s, some 100 judges have backed appeal court Judge Hennie van Heerden against Ismail Mahomed -- the first black appointee to the supreme court -- - for the top post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed all but one of the members of the Appellate Division have backed Van Heerden, the exception being Ralph Zulman, a personal friend of Mahomed. No judges have officially nominated Mahomed, according to President Nelson Mandela's office, although it is believed that a small group are quietely backing and advising him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The row hit the judiciary after the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) set up a three-man commitee to oversee the selection process, made up of Mandela's legal adviser, Professor Fink Haysom, Chief Justice Michael Corbett and Constitutional Court President Arthur Chaskalson. The committee invited the Appellate Division and the nine provincial judge presidents to put forward nominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haysom told the Mail &amp; Guardian the committee also asked Mandela and several legal associations, such as the National Association of Democratic Lawyers, for their nominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee -- which was looking for possible names, rather than a vote -- was astonished to receive a deluge of nominations from judges around the country in favour of Van Heerden. It is believed that five out of nine of the judge presidents called meetings of their members to lobby for Van Heerden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahomed -- formerly one of the country's outstanding human rights lawyers and now deputy president of the Constitutional Court and chief justice of Namibia -- has been nominated by the Black Lawyers Association and the National Association of Democratic Lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spotlight has so far focused on Mandela, who has been accused of riding roughshod over the appointment process by coming out in support of Mahomed before making his final decision. But although several in the African National Congress agree it was, politically, an unwise move, his action was consistent with the Constitution and with the process agreed between the president's office and the JSC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selection process is considerably more democratic than that under the old regime, where the appointment of the chief justice was an executive decision which enabled apartheid goverments to mould the judiciary in their image. It is also an executive decision in the US and the UK. Mandela was keen to set the right precedent as this is the first chief justice appointment under the new Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The widespread attacks on Mandela prompted Chief Justice Corbett, who as a matter of policy refuses to talk to the press, to take the unusual step of publishing a statement. The statement backed Mandela, by explaining that the Constitution said that the new chief justice was appointed by the President &quot; in consultation with the Cabinet after consultation with the JSC. As far as the JSC is concerned, the President's decision does not require the concurrence of the commission, nor is he obliged to follow any advice which the commission tenders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most startling aspect of his statement was an apparent side-swipe at Judge Joos Hefer -- his colleague on the 17-strong Appellate Division, who publicly called on Mahomed to withdraw his nomination. &quot;I might just add that calls for either candidate to withdraw are wholly unjustified and an improper interference with the procedures of the commission,&quot; said the chief justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time the South African judiciary suffered a comparable spate of controversy was in the 1950s, when the National Party twice snubbed the man described as &quot;the greatest chief justice South Africa never had&quot;, Oliver Schreiner, for the top post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, convention was that the position went to the longest-serving judge in the Appellate Division, which was Schreiner. But the NP government, which was having a constitutional show-down with the judiciary over the coloured franchise, ignored the convention and appointed a more junior man and NP sympathiser, LC Steyn, instead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - He is said to have the whole world in his hands ... but Nelson Mandela continues to be frustrated in realising the dream that appears closest to his heart: a walk down the aisle with Gra?a Machel as his bride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first on-the-record interview dealing with his love affair with Samora Machel's widow, Mandela said ruefully this week: &quot;She has made a clear statement that she will not marry the president of South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cannot overrule her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graca's refusal to contemplate marriage is believed to be due in part to pressure from the Machel family as well as Mozambique's President Joachim Chissano. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela is also believed to have objected to the idea of her ex-husband marrying again, on the grounds it would be psychologically damaging to her children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Los Angeles Times President Mandela said he plans to share his home for two weeks each month with Machel. She would also begin attending events and travelling with him. &quot;Anything is possible, save marriage,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper noted that Mandela is winding down his presidential role -- quoting his spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, as saying the president would &quot; effectively stand down from politics&quot; after he resigns the leadership of the African National Congress at its congress in December next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passionate nature of the affair between the president and Mozambique's former first lady was expressed by Machel in a radio interview this week. &quot; It's just wonderful that after so much pain I have gone through -- and I believe that is also from Nelson's side -- that finally we have found each other and can start to share a life together,&quot; she said. &quot;It is just wonderful. There were times when I thought it couldn't happen any more in my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The managing director of Times Media Limited (TML), Roy Paulson, this week confirmed he had confronted the editor of the Financial Mail (FM) and TML director, Nigel Bruce, over rumours about an extraordinary scheme to take over rival magazine Finance Week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce denies any involvement. The rumours reached fever pitch in the money- magazine industry this week of a secret deal, allegedly involving controversial publishing entepreneur Stephen Mulholland, to supplant the Financial Mail as market leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal, if it were on the cards, could have implications for the biggest black empowerment project to date -- the take-over of Johnnic assets by Cyril Ramaphosa's NEC consortium.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all the players allegedly involved -- including the FM's &quot;editor-at- large&quot;, David Gleason, who is alleged to be the key player in the scheme -- have insisted there is no substance to the rumours. Bruce this week threatened the Mail &amp; Guardian with a court interdict if it published the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been alleged that Gleason, a freelancer who is entitled to pursue his own business interests, and two other businessmen planned to buy the magazine in a deal involving Afrikaans press giant Nasionale Pers. It was suggested that Bruce and Mulholland would enter at a later stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rumours follow much speculation in financial media circles that Bruce is wary of working under the Nail/NEC consortium. Bruce said he suspected the rumours had been started by Nail executives keen to &quot;intimidate&quot; him. He was certain other businessmen were eyeing Finance Week, but neither he nor Gleason had been contacted. Bruce said businessmen who were anxious about the fate of the FM under the new owners frequently approached him with plans to buy it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paulson told the Mail &amp; Guardian both Bruce and Gleason had assured him there was nothing behind the rumours. Paulson said similar speculation had been circulating for about 18 months, but conceded that the latest batch was the most detailed to date. He said he had also approached Mulholland who had also flatly denied any involvment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paulson said Bruce had considered an interdict because of a photographer's intrusive behaviour, but not to discourage any investigations. &quot;Nigel is too much of a journalist to do that.&quot; Paulson rejected the idea that Gleason wanted to edit a magazine of his own. &quot;(Gleason) is not the editing type.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the proposed deal was to buy the magazine for R4,5m and split the equity between the TML troika, two businessmen steering the deal, Nasionale Pers and the incoming staff of Finance Week. The two businessmen apparently involved were Andy Schwartz, the former MD of now defunct Cape Investment Bank, and stockbroker Ed Hern. Both work from the same Johannesburg office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculation is the deal would involve Nasionale Pers effectively shutting down F&amp;T Weekly -- the fledgling and as yet unprofitable English translation of Finansies and Tegniek -- by incorporating the name into Finance Week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A media analyst said the contact network of the TML troika, champions of a Thatcherite economic view, could command considerable corporate support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the wave of denials there are some inconsistencies in the responses of the men involved. Naspers magazine head Salie de Swardt confirmed to the Mail &amp; Guardian he had spoken to Gleason, but would not say what they had discussed. He refused to deny he had discussed Finance Week with Gleason &quot; because I prefer not to ... but nothing is going on.&quot; Asked to confirm his contact with de Swardt, Gleason -- who denied any involvment in any bid to buy Finance Week -- told the M&amp;G he had &quot;never met the man&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hern told the M&amp;G he had met lawyers representing Finance Week, but would not say who he was representing. And Finance Week editor Stuart Murray said Hern had met Oshy Tugendhaft, a director of the magazine and a senior partner at attorneys Moss Morris. Tugendhaft represents controlling shareholder Lynne Hill, wife of Oliver Hill who is currently emprisoned in Britain pending application for his extradition to South Africa to face fraud charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murray denied any contemporary moves for the purchase of the magazine were in process. He said there had been many inquiries, but if the magazine is sold he has a legal first shot at buying it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of going to press, it is understood the alleged deal was called off . One player speculated premature leaks persuaded the bidders to pull out for the moment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is to ask shareholders for an increase in its capital base after a sharp deterioration in the Fund's cash position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michel Camdessus, the managing director, has indicated that he would like to see the fund's quotas -- the equivalent of its capital base -- doubled from the current $210-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IMF's annual report, released last week, shows that the fund's liquidity has tumbled to the lowest levels since 1987 because of the pressure put on its resources by the 1995 Mexican crisis and lending to support the Yeltsin administration in Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moscow was the biggest borrower from the fund in the last financial year, using up $5,5-billion of fund quotas. Russia is currently drawing down the biggest credit ($10,8-billion) ever advanced by the fund.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also shows that Mexico continues to draw heavily on resources, along with Argentina and Zambia. Much of the IMF's usable resources are being eaten up in lending programmes to the countries of the former Soviet bloc, with Ukraine among those which are prospective big borrowers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior fund officials conceded that achieving a doubling of resources during what is known as the 11th Quota Review will almost certainly be politically impossible, given the difficulty in getting the United States Congress to agree to any funding for international organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank is already being forced to redraw plans for the International Development Association, which makes loans to the poorest countries, because appropriations are still trapped in congressional committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials believe that although the need for greater resources can be shown, given the sharp rise in IMF members since the last quota increase, a doubling of resources is unlikely to win support of the richest industrial countries. IMF officials are still hoping for an increase of between 50 and 75%, although a formal request is unlikely to be made until the US elections are out of the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual report shows that the fund's cash declined last year and will continue to fall in the current year, given the demand on its resources and the commitments already made. It is particularly concerned, however, that the capital increase should cope with the needs of more than three dozen new members -- many of them ex-communist countries -- which have joined up since the last quota increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quota increase will also provide the opportunity for the IMF to adjust national holdings of quotas to take account of shifts in global economic power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several large countries, notably China, Russia and India, have joined the upper ranks as their national output has grown -- as have some of the East Asian tigers. As part of the quota increase they are expected to strengthen their shareholdings, but not enough to dislodge the IMF big five: the US, Japan, Germany, Britain and France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar broadening in the power base of the world economy is expected to be approved at the annual meetings of the IMF/World Bank later this month when the General Arrangements to Borrow, a credit facility for use by the IMF in emergencies, is expanded to $50-billion, bringing in a series of new countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l Uganda is expected to be the first country to benefit from the World Bank/IMF debt reduction scheme if it is approved by finance ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is still some uncertainty, because of the opposition of countries including Germany, Italy and the Nordic states to gold sales designed to help finance the IMF contribution to the plan. IMF officials have raised the possibility privately that some of the organisation's reserves might be used to close the funding gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under current figures the IMF would cut its claims on Uganda by $75-million by the end of 1999; the World Bank would have to provide a further $155- million of debt forgiveness, and other lenders, including the European Investment Bank, would come in with $18-million worth of reductions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - The World Bank has admitted that it is fighting a losing battle with Western governments over aid to the world's poorest countries and is secretly looking for ways to use private capital to replace the lost funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A top-level ad hoc panel which was set up earlier this year by James Wolfensohn, the president of the bank, to discuss how to offset the anticipated decline in government aid, has suggested private-sector investment is the only viable alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The panel believes that government aid has gone out of fashion and will never reach traditional levels again,&quot; a senior source said. &quot;So far, the only concrete alternative is investment from the markets. That would mean forming new guidelines to make sure that investment was properly used by the governments who received it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The World Bank could not be a police force, but it could influence the way money is lent or invested.&quot; There are long- standing fears that aid is misused, particularly for military purposes, by Third World dictatorships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The admission of defeat alarmed some leading charities. Justin Forsyth, Oxfam International's chief officer in Washington, said any further decline in official aid would leave many of the world's poorest nations in desperate straits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some countries, like Mozambique, do not have a choice. They will not attract private investment because of their internal troubles. If official aid declines, they will have no way of funding basic needs like education and hospitals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Simms, Christian Aid representative in London, said: &quot;This is what we have feared all along.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official development finance has fallen in recent years from $70-billion to $65-billion, while private capital flows have risen rapidly, to more than $105-billion between 1991 and 1994, according to the latest Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forsyth called on the World Bank not to give up the fight to persuade industrial countries to maintain contributions, but said it was not surprising that the World Bank was concerned about the future of aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The World Bank has lost credibility with governments because the public does not believe the money is really helping the poorest people. The non-governmental organisations think that the World Bank is more concerned with lending large amounts of money than with it reaching the people it is supposed to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The private sector is not convinced that there even needs to be a World Bank. They think there should be more guarantees for their loans rather than more World Bank funding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simms said further reliance on the markets would be the final blow for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. &quot;They have suffered because Western countries have realigned funding since the cold war ended. More money is being channelled into eastern and central Europe. If the decline in aid were being matched by productive private capital inflows we wouldn't be so worried, but it isn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ideological shift to the right, which was initiated by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, has put more emphasis on leaving development in the Third World to the free market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank's fears for official international aid have been fuelled by resistance among key donor nations to recent funding programmes. While the Republican-dominated United States Congress has thrown the aid programme into chaos by holding back on hundreds of millions of dollars which it had pledged in previous years, the Germans have put the brakes on a British-driven plan to sell International Monetary Fund gold reserves to increase debt relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each case, politicians are acutely aware of the public response to approving bigger donations. Germany has refused to sell its gold reserves to fund programmes in the eastern part of the country, and politicians are understood to be reluctant to approve an international sale in case they are forced to do the same at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British official aid to the developing world is set to decline by 16% by 1999, according to Christian Aid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Without the appropriate investment incentives, foreign firms will not dash to develop Africa's oil resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top oil industry representatives at this week's Africa Upstream conference in Cape Town warned that Africa should not expect an &quot;oil rush&quot; unless African countries did a lot more to provide the kind of investment incentives and stability the oil majors needed to move into the as yet untapped vast reservoirs of gas and oil on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big multinationals are always looking for new resources to tap into, especially when sporadic Middle Eastern political tensions send shivers through the oil markets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even Nigeria, Africa's oil giant, has seen investment and therefore reserves decline in recent years because of unfriendly attitudes towards foreign investors, never mind political turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy Africa managing director John Bentley told the conference that African production now accounted for some seven million barrels a day, or 10% of world production, despite the fact that it had about 6% of total world reserves, making it the third most important region after the Middle East and Latin America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of those oil reserves, Libya and Nigeria took up about two- thirds, and while countries such as Gabon and Egypt were increasing output, &quot;others are producing at levels well below the capacity of their reserve base&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bentley said: &quot;It is not surprising that countries that have been the most successful in exploiting their reserves tend to be those that are the most open to investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There had been a marked increase in exploration activity, mainly because of a &quot;string of recent drilling successes, particularly in deeper waters&quot; off West Africa. These included the Nkossa field off Congo, the Moho discovery and the Zafiro field off Equatorial Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These successes had been made possible by several new technological developments, which reduced risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were other risks as well, said Mobile North Sea Limited president and chairman John Cousins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doing a regional &quot;SWOT&quot; analysis, Cousins said that although exploration costs in Africa were generally competitive, many countries lacked adequate infrastructure and the kind of domestic markets that would encourage the development of gas fields. Good examples here were Mozambique's Pande gas field and Namibia's Kudu field, which were awaiting &quot;anchor&quot; industrial projects in South Africa before they could be exploited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political instability was also a problem in some areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several speakers said, however, that without &quot;fiscal certainty&quot;, attractive incentives, and stable policies, investment was unlikely, especially by the newer independent oil exploration companies coming on to the oil market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Particularly vulnerable were countries with smaller energy deposits which would not attract the oil majors no matter what the local risks and problems were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, Cousins said that a good example was Cameroon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here, through enlightened and creative thinking, new marginal field legislation has been implemented. This has successfully attracted investment for a new oil field in the Kribi Basin, the first for many years,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - While central government and labour squabble over restructuring state assets and privatisation, local authorities are leading the way in contracting out municipal services to the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As early as 1991, the Benoni Town Council started contracting out its fire and ambulance services to Fire and Emergency Service Holdings, while many townships are also privatising their waste removal in an effort to create employment and provide services that were previously lacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Philip van den Heever, director of First National Bank's Local Government and Privatisation Unit, the debate surrounding restructuring of state assets has highlighted two areas of conflict between the government and the unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is the issue of job security versus improved efficiency. The second concerns broad public ownership versus a commercially accountable management. &quot;Contracting out of government services could satisfy both sides, without removing the responsibility of service provision from the local authority,&quot; said Heever.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process is simply that the government agency enters into a contract with an agent or service provider to perform the necessary task on its behalf.  &quot;In this way, broad public ownership is retained for the right reasons and the maintenance of public interest is ensured. Elected public officials retain accountability for the delivery and quality of service,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxes, rates and tariffs are still paid directly to the government body, which can cancel or replace the services provided by the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could mean appropriate levels of service at an affordable rate, with uneconomic areas being subsidised initially and developed areas being run by the service provider at a profit to the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Barber, managing director of Fire and Emergency Service Holdings, says its operation has already resulted in savings topping R16-million for the Benoni authorities and a 25% annual reduction in expenditure on fire and ambulance services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Benoni subsidiary achieved a R14-million turnover for the financial year 1995/96. This success has allowed the holding company to start vertically integrating into the manufacture and retail of fire engines, emergency control and rescue ambulance services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This allows cost savings to be directly passed on to the local authorities, &quot; Barber said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Barber, local authorities throughout South Africa are increasingly looking at contracting out services as shown by the company's recently acquired contract for the provision of emergency services in the Natal Midlands region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is expecting to achieve a R50-million turnover at financial year- end. &quot;But we still face opposition from certain quarters to our operation,&quot; Barber says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes this stems from the misconceptions that contracting out is a job destroyer. &quot;We are actually job creators. There were no retrenchments from the 178 personnel at the Benoni emergency services when we took over, in fact the holding company now employs 500 people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barber argues that if the government had to contract out all its emergency services it could achieve savings of R1-billion over the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to van den Heever, new efficiencies are evident within the Benoni emergency services as the company strives to ensure the renewal of its contract with the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This bid for efficiency is seen in several townships that have employed a private waste-management consultancy for domestic waste removal. &quot;The concept embraces the principles of the Reconstruction and Development Programme by training unemployed people to establish and run privately owned waste management operations in their own communities,&quot; said Billy Hattingh, owner of Billy Hattingh &amp; Associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A contractual agreement is negotiated between a newly trained entrepreneur and the local authority, under the terms of which the entrepreneur is expected to carry out waste removal from an agreed area for remuneration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This contract varies in size from R24 000 to R26 000 and each area is allocated up to a 1 000 houses a day to service. The concept was first introduced in KwaNdebele and has proved so successful it has been implemented in Orange Farm, Ivory Park and Shosanguwe. Port Elizabeth, Welkom and Kimberley are set to follow soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have seen an increase in the payment of services in the communities where we have been operating,&quot; Hattingh said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The apparent change of heart by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) on privatisation has been greeted as a positive move by both business and the government. Sam Shilowa, general secretary of Cosatu, endorsed partial privatisation as one way of restructuring state assets after last weekend's meeting of the union's central executive committee (CEC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business now feels negotiations on privatisation can finally begin in earnest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Enterprise Minister Stella Sigcau said the decision marks a constructive milestone in the government's evolving economic strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an exciting step forward in developing a rigorous growth-oriented approach to the economy with a broad national consensus on generating economic opportunities and job creation,&quot; said Sigcau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The warm reception by the international money markets and potential investors, both domestic and foreign, speaks for itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Coleman, public finance director of Standard Corporate Merchant Bank, feels Cosatu's statement may be seen as vague and tentative, but it is nonetheless a positive step forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a document of compromise,&quot; Coleman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cosatu fears the initiative is slipping away from them. They have had to change their attitude to privatisation if they plan to have a say in the restructuring of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the government and labour are that far apart from each other anymore,&quot; says Coleman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEC did reiterate its opposition to &quot;wholesale privatisation of state assets&quot; and remains opposed to the basic thrust of the government's macro- economic framework -- growth, employment and redistribution (Gear). But it said there may be &quot;state assets which should have never belonged to the state sector in the first place&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu doesn't appear willing to lose the commanding heights of the economy controlled by the state, arguing that certain sectors should remain in public hands. These include posts and telecommunications, electricity, public transport, housing, health, water, state forests, municipal services, education and roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We acknowledge that the Reconstruction and Development Programme envisages a role for the private sector. But equally it envisages a role for the state in production,&quot; the CEC said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where there is a compelling case for private sector capital (in limited form), the union feels the state should remain the majority shareholder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Lacey, senior economist of the South African Chamber of Business, believes opposition to Gear will undermine the government's 6% growth strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Privatisation is one of the essential cornerstones of Gear. If they (Cosatu) don't take it completely on board it will put the pressure back on monetary and fiscal policy,&quot; Lacey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Lloyd, national official with the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), said the larger unions within the federation had for quite a while adopted a pragmatic opinion on partial privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ourselves, along with the more pragmatic unions like the National Union of Mineworkers, were the architects behind the shift in policy,&quot; Lloyd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Lloyd there will be inevitable back-street fighting among the unions, especially from the public sector unions, which he says are still fundamentally opposed to privatisation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The domestic worker affiliate union of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has been dissolved, leaving question marks over the effectiveness of world-class legislation about to be passed to protect the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Domestic Workers Union (Sadwu) decided to dissolve at a special congress held a fortnight ago and the decision has since been ratified by Cosatu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadwu suffered a severe cut in foreign funding, with allegations of mismanagement also being levelled at the union's leadership in Cape Town. The federation will not confirm rumours of mismanagement, though assistant general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi says funding from Nordic countries, which sustained the union, has slowed to a trickle in the past two years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You cannot run a union on external funds,&quot; says Vavi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Sadwu members are seeking affiliation to other Cosatu unions. It has earmarked the South African Commercial Catering and Allied Workers Union, as well as the Transport and General Workers Union as a potential home for its 12 000 members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also talk at Cosatu of the formation of a service union where security guards, cleaners, workers in the hotel and catering industry, as well as domestic workers can be organised. Vavi says: &quot;It's sad that domestic workers don't have a home. They can't exploit the fruits of democracy when we don't have a collective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domestic work in South Africa has a hue all of its own. It's always been coloured by apartheid; most madams are white; most maids black. But that's changing with the growth of a new black middle class. The country's large pool of unskilled labour means that for many young and mostly rural black women, domestic work is their only career path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work is often long and underpaid. Although Sadwu recommends a salary of R1 200, very few employers pay this. In some areas, salaries still barely top R100 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About three years ago, Cosatu successfully campaigned for the inclusion of domestic and farmworkers in the ambit of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act. The new provisions did not set a minimum wage; all they did was put in place fairer working conditions, set working hours, holiday pay and leave. It was lauded at the time, though it is now clear that the legislation is little more than a pretty paper concept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The legislation has had very little impact,&quot; says Vavi. This legislation is set to be beefed up by its inclusion in the Employment Standards Bill, currently being negotiated at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labour Department's director of minimum standards, Lisa Seftel, says domestic workers could have a separate Sectoral Employment Standard. This standard would take into account the special conditions of domestic work, including the fact that most domestic workers live on their employer's premises and look after young children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seftel says enforcing such stringent legislation is difficult. &quot;There's a constitutional constraint on the right to privacy. You can't just walk into somebody's house.&quot; The department's implementation strategy is headed in the direction of prevention rather than inspection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is planning an education campaign to inform both employers and employees of their rights under the new law. In the absence of a trade union in the sector, Seftel says the department is considering working through those places where domestic workers congregate, such as local branches of political parties, churches, clinics and women's organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour watchers doubt that Sadwu will work again. It's difficult to organise the sector because there is no shop- floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is only a single employer for a single worker,&quot; says Vavi. &quot;It's impossible to organise stop-orders.&quot; This makes the prospect of self- sufficiency extremely difficult. Employment in the sector is very fluid, with the rate of dismissals and movement of staff very high.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Five European cities in as many days is &quot;hell on the body, but great for the country&quot;, says Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, citing the DM500-million Eurobond issue as evidence of a successful tour. Now he has to win over the United States -- and specifically the pension funds with $6- trillion under management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It'll be interesting,&quot; he says, &quot;to see if we can prise loose the funds only a month before the presidential election. But the deputy president's trip was well received -- a nice foretaste of what we can expect next month.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel and Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, went to Europe to get back into the Deutschemark market and set a new benchmark with a longer maturity profile, as part of South Africa's debt management strategy. They left with an objective -- DM450-million, five to seven years; what they got is DM500-million with seven years' maturity, at 140 basis points over the Bund rate, or 110 over Libor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Germans generally go for government stock but they don't quite go for seven years; they like to come in shorter, so by all accounts it's very favourable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ride wasn't all smooth, though. &quot;There were some pretty hostile questions from fund managers in London, about affirmative action and government contracts,&quot; says Manuel. &quot;The question of crime is something you must expect when talking to foreign investors, but it was the way it was pitched that left a bad taste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other than that, though, we were well received -- as evidenced by the take- up on the bond issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel is confident about prospects for next month's roadshow in the US, although the timing may be a bit awkward. So why go a month before the elections? &quot;We're doing it back-to-back with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) summit; I don't like to be away too often.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, judging by the number of times our interview was postponed, he is keeping very busy. But the investment community and the public at large remain sceptical about his performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much is made of the poor reception he apparently received in London and Washington earlier this year, and his now infamous dismissal of the markets as &quot;amorphous&quot; is dug up time and again. Siding with the All Blacks against the Springboks brought him more flak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is philosophical: &quot;When Marius Daling (of Sanlam) made the same remark (about markets) at the recent National African Federated Chamber of Commerce and Industry conference, the media did not react -- and it wasn't said tongue- in-cheek, nor is he the only one to have said it. Are the media fair? You tell me. But I'm not going to whinge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism of his performance abroad is also shrugged off. &quot;Our objectives on that occasion were very different. Some fund managers felt left out, but we were there to talk to central bankers, Michel Camdessus of the IMF, and others. We have to evaluate the success of the trip against the objectives we set ourselves. That was not a roadshow, this latest trip was, and it must be seen in a different light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a sense of frustration, though: &quot;Everyone keeps asking me about privatisation and pushing for a time-frame. Another favourite is exchange controls. We are doing something, but cautiously. You can't lift controls one day and then change your mind -- so you'd better get it right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He points to the significant steps already taken, including raising the offshore investment limit for institutions to 10%. &quot;You could then say, what about the other 90%, or you could take the view, along with Britain and the US, that it is a prudent requirement that institutions should hold 90% of the public's savings in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a perception that we stand out like a sore thumb with all manner of controls, that we're not moving on the issue. From March 13 last year, when the currency unified, to the end of June this year (when the 10% offshore investment limit was introduced), we've taken very big steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that our reserve position were different. But that we had 12 weeks of cover to provide a sufficient buffer. Then we could afford to be much bolder.  We only have one shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same cautious, cerebral approach applies to privatisation. New Zealand had 12 years to implement its sell-off plans -- we don't have the same luxury of time, says Manuel. &quot;But we're getting there: the appointment of HSBC as adviser is only the first step.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the lambasting he has received this year, Manuel is quietly confident that the economy is on track to achieve the targets laid out in the macro-economic strategy unveiled in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A flash-in-the-pan growth rate of 6% is not enough; we need a policy alignment to make it stick and that's what we're working on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does South Africa have the wherewithal? Fiscal policy is on track -- &quot;we will meet the 3% Budget deficit target&quot; -- and he has few concerns over monetary policy. Indeed, he was impressed with Stals's performance: &quot;There was a lot of pressure on him -- not political, mind -- to raise interest rates, but he resisted. Rate changes are the governor's call -- he informs me of his decision before the event but that is all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Macro-economic policy is not just about interest rates, though. On the trade front, &quot;we're seeing some lags shorten&quot;, and investment is &quot;not unimpressive&quot;. And the new vigour to the Competition Board, witness its decision to block the cement merger, gets a special mention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A queue of impatient officials is forming outside the minister's door as we touch on the subject of the unions and the potential for conflict: &quot;What we need is bigger than individuals. The government can't expect everybody to become lapdogs that are stroked into submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't get into fist-fights with Sam Shilowa (head of the Confederation of South African Trade Unions) or anyone else. There are vested interests on all sides, including business; government must listen, but not become a passive broker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to build understanding,&quot; he says, presumably hoping his critics will take note.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - &quot;Vision 2000&quot; screamed the headlines when ambitious plans were announced to ensure the qualification of the national Under-23 side for the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the the names of the Sasol Super Squad were announced for last week's friendly against Namibia, there was definitely no vision, but more shortsightedness by coach Mich D'Avray. He seems to choose his squad with the intnetion of not losing, rather than using the friendly games to experiment with young players, no matter what the result.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of the squad of 16 chosen for the Namibia game, only five will be available for the Sydney Olympics and when the side took the field only two players were eligible for Sydney -- Bradley Carnell and Quinton Fortune, both 19 years old. The rest of the squad -- that also contained two over age players, Pollen Ndlanya (26) and David Byrne (36) -- were either 23 or 22 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to include Byrne in the side was to add experience, but it was a tactic that failed miserably, as the side still seemed as disorganised as ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its formation, the much vaunted Sasol Super Squad has failed to impress, and on a number of occasions were embarrassed by opponents with only a fraction of the financial input that D'Avray's squad has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was clearly illustrated by comments made by a Namibian official after the game. &quot;With the money and facilities available in this country, how is it possible that you can produce such a weak squad? If that is the future of South African soccer, then there are lean years ahead for Bafana Bafana.&quot; Another senior South African club official, who asked to remain anonymous, referred to the squad as a &quot;private club&quot;, in reference to the fact that the reasoning behind the selections and running of the squad is known only to the sponsors and a few others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the players in the squad are not perofrming at club level, yet they are automatic choices for the Super Squad, this while a player like Celtic's Vasilli Sofiadeles (21), who has been very impressive so far this season, is constantly overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the rest of Africa, South Africa has a system where the various national teams are run separately from one another. The Under-17, Under-20 and Under-23 sides all have different sponsors and coaches, and the styles of football that are played are different as well. To make matters worse, each squad wears different kit, unlike the rest of Africa, or the world for that matter, where all national sides wear the same colours to make them easily identifiable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also seems to be no consultation among the three coaches -- D'Avray, Trott Moloto (U-17) and Shakes Mashaba (U-20. It is common practice in the rest of Africa that the coach of the national side is also in charge of the junior sides, and travels with them. Two examples are former Angolan coach, Carlos Alhinho, and Kenyan coach Vojo Gardesevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is virtually impossible to be a national coach and not know what is happening at the junior levels. I travel to all the games of all the national sides, and one thing is for sure, we all play the same style of soccer,&quot; said Alhinho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By me being involved in all the national sides, I am able to bring players from the various age groups through much more easily as I know the players.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The past and present Springbok captains clash when Francois Pienaar's Transvaal take on Gary Teichmann's Natal this weekend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little left really for Transvaal this season but to pick up the pieces. A win against Natal at King's Park in Durban this weekend will perhaps keep them in the running for the Currie Cup, but the side, laden with Springboks, has underchieved in a rather dramatic fashion this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It started with the disasters of the Super 12. Injuries, sanctions against Johan le Roux and James Dalton for on-the- field infringements and the loss of Kitch Christie as coach began it all.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The malaise within the Transvaal team continued with schisms within the playing staff and the appointment of Alex Wylie to run things during the domestic season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie, so history has proved, was not the answer. It seemed that the harder the side tried the worse it became. They have, in short, never looked close to being the side of two seasons ago that swept all before them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big New Zealander has now departed for Argentina to put his coaching abilities to work for the Pumas, and Ray Mordt has taken over for the second time after losing his job as as an assistant coach to the national team as the musical chairs continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Transvaal, though, the good news is that Francois Pienaar is back in harness after injury forced him to sit out the series against the All Blacks.  You get the feeling that too much was asked of Pienaar for too long by his Transvaal side. He delivered until his body -- an entity Pienaar uses as much as a weapon as he does as a means of perambulation -- finally cried halt to the incessant battering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was as if the side had lost a heart as well as a skipper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is one of those open secrets that Pienaar faces an uphill battle to regain his rightful position as Springbok captain. The first leg of that journey begins in Durban this Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against him, his teammates and any vague chance of regaining former glory and taking the trophy home to Ellis Park at the end of the season is ranged perhaps the best combination in South African rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a side led by the man who took over the mantle of captaincy from him, Gary Teichmann. Natal have shown all that is good in the game this season, grinding it out in the set phases and lending a lift and lilt to the business of backline play that has joyously restated the oft forgotten basis of rugby that this is indeed a pastime played with the ball in the hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an ingriguing prospect that if indeed Pienaar is on the Springbok nasty list and this signals the start of his own attempt at renaissance in the red and white battle colours of Transvaal, it is equally true of James Small in the black and white jersey of Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intriguing because both players have little left to prove in terms of ability on the field. Small by his individualistic attitude has made his own problems off the field and paid a harsh penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pienaar, the leader of the players' revolt which led to the onset of what has been a chaotic and ill-managed start to the professional era, is of a different, less streetsmart demeanour. Yet, beneath the walkman Small wears like a talisman, and the silk of Pienaar's tested diplomacy, lies a steely determination in both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is perhaps on this attribute that the match will pivot. Pienaar will be once again laying it all on the line to keep his men in contention. Small, equally, will be fighting to prove his critics in the realm of officialdom wrong by placing his heart foursquare in the centre of the pitch as he does each representative game he plays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is one of those patches of sporting drama which offers much. As a side plot there is the looming figure of Teichmann, an inspirational, lead-from- the-front man who is as unlikely a human to willingly concede top billing as any.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the guidance of Ian Macintosh -- unquestionably the best thinker of the game in this country now that Christie has taken a back seat -- Teichmann has taken his game a step beyond what would have normally been believed to be credible or possible just two seasons ago and urged on a Natal side with both guts and gusto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teichmann will not willingly concede either the points on offer this weekend or his nascent Springbok captaincy without fighting for it. His recent history on the long road to an international career alone proves that the rangy eighthman is no quitter. The same is true of the coach, harshly treated by the national side in many respects, MacIntosh has fought back under the Natal banner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacIntosh deserves far more credit than he has got for what he has done for both rugby in general and Natal in particular. He has managed to graft the sheer delight of running with the ball in the hand to the business end of it and in the process moulded a side of real quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the freedom MacIntosh has given his players, they will continue to make mistakes. But the blemishes have -- this season at least -- all come from the licence for creativity, the quest to do something different and new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could be argued that this is one of the few areas in this country's game where things are moving and the inherent conservatism of South Africans has not held sway. MacIntosh is, in short, doing what the New Zealand coach John Hart has managed so successfully, opening the game to new ideas and new avenues of attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transvaal on the other hand have been scrabbling to apply the old formula of subdue and penetrate with little success. Against South Eastern Transvaal, a side with little to lose and everything to gain, the formula showed the holes that must perforce come from an undershirt worn too long and washed too often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this garb they will have to wear at King's Park in an attempt to resuscitate a season that will not rate as one they will remember with any real pride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether they can shake the perception of raggedness off and lift their heads again is the task that faces Pienaar and his bedraggled Golden Lions.  Against them are an unbeaten team who have already scored an average of over 50 points in the 10 unbeaten games they have played this season, are a point clear at the top of Section A ... and have a game in hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Transvaal do, as everything would suggest, come out of the weekend as losers, then the season will surely be convincingly rather than figuratively over.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is, given the length and public ugliness of the rugby season, gratifying that some semblance of order is about to come back into our sporting lives with the first hints of the budding cricket season ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend there comes the chance to shake off some of the rust of inactivity in the Hong Kong Sixes, where Hansie Cronje leads a squad -- which includes Derek Crookes in place of the injured Jonty Rhodes -- into a tournament that has further refined the slam-bang of the one-day game into a made-for-TV spectacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the players might take it seriously as the official line, there can be little doubt that the Sixes -- played as they are on a pocket handkerchief ground -- owe more to beef and boogie than to batting and bowling.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is though an ideal chance to ease the way into a season that presents more than one hurdle for Cronje and the national side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It presents Cronje with the opportunity to swing a bat, Allan Donald a chance to get his arm moving and opens the way for Richard Snell to flay anything bowled at him as well turn his arm over and work on the errant line and length which has cost him so dearly at top level of late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally it is fitting that largely unheralded players of the class of Dean Laing and Bradley Player get a chance to strut their stuff on a stage more elevated than provincial competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while this could be the swansong of veteran Adrian Kuiper as a representative of his country, there can be no finer place to play out the last notes of a long and tuneful career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For following the warm-up in Hong Kong comes the more serious business of the coming quadrangular tournament in Kenya and the looming possibility of showing that the South Africans could well have beaten Sri Lanka had they made the finals of the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This in turn serves as an introduction back into the game at international level for the three-test tour of India to follow. This is serious stuff. Just playing on the Indian sub-continent is difficult enough. Winning a series in front of the fanatical Indian crowds a different matter altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India are also, as national coach Bob Woolmer characterises them, &quot;an extremely dangerous side&quot; and never easy to beat in their own sun-scorched and monsoon-lashed backyard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the minute master batsman Sachin Tendulkar installed as the new captain in place of the gentlemanly Mohammad Azharrudin, the South Africans can probably expect a more aggressive and less measured approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening half of the two-part meeting comes when the Indians return the favour and come back here for their second tour of this country and a three- test series to match that on their own soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then it is the Australians back in South Africa to resume the traditional rivalry in another three-test series to round out the season that only those oblivious of the joys of the world's greatest game claim to be unaware of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a programme as uncompromising and arduous as anyone could have dreamt of and offers much in the anticipation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But first things first, Hong Kong beware. Hansie and his manne are on their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The squad: Hansie Cronje (captain), Adrian Kuiper, Richard Snell, Dean Laing, Bradley Player, Alan Donald, Derek Crookes</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After being overlooked for a long time Fani Madida is back in the South African squad for the Four Nations tournament, and after their first two matches the team tops the log</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running onto the field against Kenya last weekend in the first game of the Simba Four Nations Cup was a victory in itself for Fani Madida, who in the process gained his 10th cap for his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The game was also historic for Madida in that it was at Kings Park Rugby Stadium in 1992 that he made his debut for Bafana Bafana, in the isolation- breaking game against Cameroon on July 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the announcement of the squad for the tournament was made by national coach Clive Barker, it was accepted by many a football fans in the country that the 29-year-old Turkish- based striker was a spent force as far as playing for South Africa was concerned, especially after the comments he made about Barker in the press a few months before.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had attacked Barker for not giving a valid reason for not leaving him out, speaking to anyone who would listen and seemingly burying his chances of playing even further. &quot;To me the story of Barker having to wait for a progress report on my performances in Turkey is just a bluff as far as I am concerned,&quot; Madida said at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madida's outburst against the coach was more frustration than anything else from a player who believes that he still has what it takes to be in the national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe my style of play does not suit the current coach, but I am the striker that scored the record number of goals in South Africa,&quot; he said.  Many, including the man himself, felt that it was because he refused to tour Australia in 1994 that his problems with Barker started. Madida said he was tired after a hectic season in Turkey and was entitled to a rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He played his last game for South Africa on October 15 1994, a Nations Cup qualifier against Mauritius, which was won 1-0 by Bafana Bafana via a Phil Masinga goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, Madida, who currently plays for Turkish first division club Antalyaspor, seemingly disappeared from the limelight. This is the player who still holds a South African scoring record -- in 1991 he scored 34 goals in 42 games for Kaizer Chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though a prolific scorer at club level, Madida could never produce the same form at national level. Not possessing the speed of old, Madida these days plays in a midfield striker role, scoring his goals from the deep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some time ago when asked if he would ever smoke the peace pipe with Barker, Madida replied, &quot;Well, there is a truth commission in the country now, so anything is possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And judging by the way things turned out for Madida and Barker, there is hope for the country in more ways than one. The fact that Barker has seen fit to choose Madida also shows a maturity on the side of the coach who has acted in the interest of the team, wheras many others would have marginilised the player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madida is hoping to return to South Africa in 1998, and end his career in the country of his birth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Friday morning at the Market Theatre complex, Johannesburg.  A bearded, pipe-smoking man is trying to contain himself. The source of his discomfort is the cast of a play who are drifting in with varying degrees of tardiness. &quot;We really need to give them a talking to this time, we are professionals you know,&quot; he says to a young publicist who's been buzzing around the office seemingly not achieving anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryk Hattingh settles himself down on the concrete ground and lights his pipe. He's the director of One Voice, a workshopped musical drama billed on the Arts Alive festival.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the idea behind One Voice is ultimately to be found within Hattingh's bearded persona, the real creators are the actors themselves. Ten high school children first met in June and, through a process of exploration, learned to trust one another and eventually tell the diverse tales of growing up in turbulent times. On hearing the concept, one can't help but wonder whether this was an attempt to imitate Athol Fugard's 1995 hit, Valley Song. &quot;No,&quot; is Hattingh's emphatic answer, &quot;he (Fugard) had a lot of time, so he could get the kids to keep diaries, which I did not have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hattingh had only three months to audition 40 children and out of these choose a cast. &quot;Do you want a racial breakdown? &quot; he asks, a cynical smile hovering at the corner of his mouth. &quot;Six black, two coloured, one white and one Indian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are scheduled to perform in Tladi in Soweto and one of the cast members is late beyond embarrassment. Hattingh wonders out loud whether or not the play can go on without her. While we wait we speak about who he is, as an Afrikaner intellectual who was involved in the process that ultimately helped destigmatise the language in the eyes of many lefties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His play, Sing Jy Van Bomme (1988), caused quite a stir with its scathing criticism of the SA military. A career that spans publishing and writing has included stints with the now defunct alternative Afrikaans weeklies, Vrye Weekblad and Die Suid Afrikaan. And then a particularly strange career move; editing an Afrikaans porno magazine, Loslyf. &quot;Afrikaners have always been portrayed as khaki-clad repressed people and I wanted to show them as normal, sexual, fucking human beings&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missing cast member arrives -- she had a surprise test at school. All is forgiven and the show can go on. The venue is Prudence High School, a dress rehearsal. On the drive over to Soweto, Hattingh had been wondering whether the venue would prove good enough. He knows that it is not exactly going to be Broadway, but hopes that it'll be better than he suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His instinct is right -- it's quite terrible; an outdoor venue with the audience a group of high school pupils waiting to attend a fund-raising event.  They would far rather be listening to Whitney Houston than to Nonini Nquma tell how her father was tortured by the security branch; are visibly uninterested in Laurence Horn's poignant travelogue through the journey of his abandonment by his parents. After the performance, Horn seems quite hurt by the reaction but tries to be adult about it: &quot;I understand where they come from. Why should they be interested in the life of a whitey who was left by his parents ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the performance Hattingh is a bundle of nerves, listening to every word &quot;the kids&quot; utter from the makeshift stage. &quot;She started that in the wrong key,&quot; he says, half to himself, as Thobeka Gumede powers through a religious song. If she did, no one noticed, because this young woman has a voice so charged it is almost upsetting. It's the kind of voice that saps one's emotions while feeding the soul. She holds the restless audience's attention quite admirably with her tale of how her older brother, an ANC member, was abducted and later found murdered in a sports field. She says that she has forgiven her brother's killers, &quot;I don't know how, but I have ...  &quot; It is just a pity that the audience is not very appreciative of the depth of her emotion and at what it took to get it all out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later we all sit at the Wimpy and the heart-rending stories seem to fade as the cast dance to piped music, a song called Thobeka by Boom Shaka. They have become teenagers again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are still quite excited by having actually performed in front of a real audience. That there were no acoustics to speak of doesn't seem to diminish the thrill of having told a story and sung and rapped. Rap? Somehow the rap seemed out of place in a collection of songs ranging from choral to traditional. I ask Hattingh about it. &quot;The kids absolutely insisted on including rap,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the baptism by fire in Soweto, the next performance is scheduled for the following day at the Civic Theatre. This is to be a walk in the park by comparison and some of the proud parents are present to see their children on stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the professional facilities and the girls all made up, the two performances are worlds apart. The play hasn't lost its edge, but everything goes smoothly in front of a decidedly more restrained audience that claps in all the right places even though it might not fully understand where the music is coming from. Fifty-five minutes and it is all over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So what is going to happen to these kids after these performances?&quot; I had asked after the Soweto show. &quot;It's not in my hands. Some of them would like to continue in the theatre and others don't ... I would not have liked that this raw talent be left to go to waste,&quot; Hattingh had said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's this talent that has told a story with the power to touch someone so profoundly that he felt it should be heard by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. After seeing the Saturday evening show, Hugh Lewin of the TRC has subsequently arranged that exactly that happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Voice will be staged at various venues until September 27. Call 838- 4563 for details</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg Streak is the first South African artist to win a place in one of the world's great sculpture schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At last, a white male South African who doesn't spend his days whingeing about feeling dislocated, alienated and oh so lonesome in the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Durban artist Greg Streak (25) whacks all those emotions into a unique style of pop comic sculpture that is gratefully void of sentimental semantics. Very possibly, this is the reason he's been selected above 678 other applicants from New York to Hong Kong to study at the prestigious Rijksakademie van Beelende Kunsten in Amsterdam next year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His work is big, bold and beautiful. It deals with his loss of faith in contemporary value systems, his sense of global dislocation and an overwhelming desire to toss even Mother Mary onto the cross. Well why not? In one sculpture, Compromise and Prejudice, Streak deals with the notion of male sacrifice using the crucifix as a methaphor. It's not a naturalistic figure but a massive human cut-out of a bald, white male wearing silver lead gloves for protection, yet equally, and ambiguously, denying a sense of touch. Like the goggles that protect his eyes but don't allow him to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently completing his Masters Degree in Fine Art on bursary at Technikon Natal, and having worked as an assistant to that mighty talented South African sculptor, Andries Botha, Streak was born in what he still calls &quot; Rhodesia&quot;, and unabashedly admits he doesn't know what it's like to be South African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a Eurocentric upbringing and education and this perpetual onslaught of America blasting at me ... and in South Africa we have this incredible social transformation happening right now. So yes, I'm searching for a sense of stability and belonging through my art&quot;. He believes in the poetry of the visual language instead of the sledgehammer approach. He also believes strongly in the traditional hands- on approach where the artist is physically involved in the craftsmanship, which is why he's quite content spending three months on a sculpture, working with fibreglass, resin, wax, found objects and various mixed-media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg Streak's sculptures are on group exhibit at Durban's NSA Gallery until October 3</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The insularity and complacency of the Cape Town art scene has become a commonplace of South African art journalism. The only solution for artists is often to move northward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the last few years have seen the birth and maturation of a number of exhibition spaces, such as The Castle and the Planet Cafe Contemporary Art Site, which could slow this migration. They have cultivated off-beat work that often takes swipes at the more &quot;blockbustery&quot; shows.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly opened Labia Gallery, under the curatorship of Gwynneth Harris, is more traditionally Capetonian -- elegantly done-up; no-smoking; paintings hanging politely on the walls. Situated on the periphery of the CBD, it has the potential to be one of the most visited galleries in Cape Town. There is even a balsamic-vinegar-and-sun-dried-tomato restaurant and bar next door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the opening exhibition of 21 artists does not do enough to distinguish the Labia from the many Cape Town galleries providing a space for art destined for the boardroom or the well-heeled sitting room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the overall selection and hanging of the works seems to be a bit arbitrary, there is an encouraging blend of established artists -- Willem Strydom, Gail Caitlin, Andrew Verster -- and younger, lesser-known artists such as Reuben Matemane, Johan Louw and Luliette Armstrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the strength of the exhibition rests on too few shoulders. Among these are Verster's Two Interiors, which draw part of their vitality from the painter's longstanding dialogue with Matisse, combining incisive line and flat, vigorous colour, playing the two formal propositions against one another. These works celebrate the decorative as an ingredient of good painting, and explore its potential as a means for imbuing subject matter with an intensity that is disquieting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louw's desolate, near monochromatic landscape is another example of painting that is both pleasurable and disturbing. The paint that renders the foreground rocks is dragged and pulled across the surface, evoking a kind of fleshiness reminiscent of Lucian Freud's figure paintings or Clive van den Berg's pastel landscape drawings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a similarly painterly tack, Claire Menck's small, charged works reflect a mature, sensitive artistic intelligence alive to the constraints and freedoms offered by the limited format.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, the balance of the work on show seems unfocused and lightweight. A perhaps disproportionate amount of wall- space has been given over to Elaine Jeacock's large watercolours of largely nude or partly clothed women. The use of watercolour in a large format is both unusual and ambitious, and may bear fruit for this artist in the future. For the moment, though, the rendering of bodies and the quality of paint barely falls within the category of &quot;adequate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more worrying are the tired seductions of trite metaphors that feature in some of the works -- in Woman in a Red Dress, the figure's splayed legs serve as backdrop to a table decorated with the inevitable split paw-paw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the whole, the exhibition is fraught with the problems of assembling such a large body of work in the absense of any clear criteria for selection.  The quality of the work is uneven and although there is a largely figurative and painterly emphasis in the show as a whole, the styles and intentions of the works have little to do with one another, little to say to one another and pose few questions about what is going on in painting in South Africa at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the forthcoming exhibitions by Verster and Berlin artist Mark Hipper signal that the Labia Gallery can, with a bit of daring, provide a valuable venue for artists and audiences interested in traditions that need not seem uncritical of their defining conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show runs until September 21</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Playwright and poet, Maishe Maponya, is Johannesburg's latest high power cultural appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I was called an angry young man, you know,&quot; Maishe Maponya laughs gently at the recollection. With bene-volent smile and trademark scull cap framing his face like a tight-fitting halo, he looks positively papal in disposition (perhaps an inappropriate metaphor, given his undisguised distate for titles).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's impossible that the cultural officer-to-be of Johannesburg's Southern Substructure could be described in anything but benign terms. Yet anger (and hunger) have been two of the driving forces in his life. And when the fury threatened to consume him, he channelled it through ubuntu. It is this unflagging belief in the African principle of humanism that informs Maponya's cultural vision today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a firm believer in collective responsibility&quot;, he says, outlining his plans for transforming one of Gauteng's most neglected (and contradictory) cultural turfs -- parts of Mondeor, Lenasia and Soweto -- into vibrant cultural communities. &quot;It wasn't a political appointment. I see myself as serving a broader community in order to help arts and culture become part and parcel of communities in a non- partisan way.&quot; He adds: &quot;Without deference to protocol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maponya can hardly be described as a yes man. A renowned playwright, director, poet and performer, his work -- for example, plays like Hungry Earth and Jika (written in the late 1970s and 1980s, respectively) -- have been infused with a militant, yet fiercely individualistic political consciousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To many, his writing -- passionate, metaphorically dense and inescapably didactic -- typified the black consciousness protest theatre of the times.  Yet there remained something strongly aloof within Maponya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This might to some extent explain the title of his most recent work, a performance for Biko week in September called Monuments/ Bambata: I Read what I Like. Written between 1992 and 1994, it offers a collage performance comprising epic poetry and excerpts from his play Gangsters, performed against a backdrop of percussive instruments. Critic Gwen Ansell described it as &quot;quite brilliant&quot; and bewailed the fact that it was not part of the September Arts Alive lineup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then again, Maponya is used to being sidelined. In 1981, after failing repeatedly to gain sponsorship, he took Hungry Earth overseas &quot;out of my own pocket&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he did not join the brothers and sisters in exile because &quot;the struggle was here, on many fronts. And, despite his widely acknowledged intellectual acumen, Maponya has remained curiously low key, and his voice, at times, surprisingly soft. Although he sits on the board of the (will-it won't-it be transformed?) Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal (Pact), his outspokenness against the presence of the cultural old guard is less vociferous than one might think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently a senior lecturer in the drama department at Wits university, he's been invited to perform his work at Unisa, but never on home turf. Maybe the reason he takes a less visible seat in the front row is because he does not see cultural achievement as golden goose of self-gratification. &quot;I really don't mind being side-lined,&quot; he says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure yet how I will implement my vision. I just want to go in and see what's in place, understand the existing structures and their shortfalls.  That will entail delegating and putting competent people in positions of responsibility. This will mean assuming a less visible, more humble, but no less committed role in cultural transformation.&quot; He adds: &quot;We need to understand who we are, acknowledge how our history has informed where we are and embrace the need for co- operation without blind consensus ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He quotes from I Read What I Like: &quot;... recapturing ourselves in the rubble of facades, / Every piece a victory, / We'll have to create, / A monument of pieces, / every calendar day a monument, / every monument a victory, / every victory a monument ...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Forget screams, moans and squishing noises. The sexiest sound in the world is a big fat horn line playing jazz. Irakere, or &quot;The Forest&quot;, last week's jazz guests for Arts Alive, feature four horns. On saxes, Cesar Lopez provides the intellectual acrobatics and an ironic take on the more florid ballad numbers while Alfres Thomson's warm tenor adds guts and heart. On first trumpet, Mario Hernandez effortlessly has the highs without ever sacrificing roundness and warmth. He's a wonderfully old-fashioned player -- old-fashioned as in Clifford Brown. His dreadlocked partner, Basillo Marquez offers a sharper, dizzier approach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's also leader Chucho Valdez's scholarly, swing piano and arrangements, Mayra Valdez's inspired scatting and soulful shouts, a drum team that leaps between the Yoruba forests and Birdland -- so many riches, crammed into one band.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme mixed Afro-Cuban rhythms and structures (rhumba, bolera, salsa) with jazz standards; these latter often taken at breakneck unison speed in idiosyncratic mixes -- like the medley which combined a brief excursion to Georgia with I'll Remember April. By the end of the evening, the whole audience was sweatily invoking Oludun, critical faculty totally suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And after the high subsides, what can we learn from Irakere -- particularly in the context of an evening which began with a sloppy and lustreless set from Mike Makhalemehele? Strong rhythm work, Bush Sestlolo's distinctive keyboard style (given full rein for once, on a great instrument), and Bheki Khoza's astute, intricate driving guitar solos all won hearts, as did the charm of Makhalamele's own compositions. But the set began ten minutes late, the opener, Moraledi, was disjointed and uneven -- and it is no longer charming (if it ever was) to confess that you only met the piano-player yesterday and don't know his name. It simply makes us all wonder how much preparation you put in to what we are paying for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, let's look again at Irakere. They come from Cuba where music education is freely available for the talented; where it is a source of pride to be a musician, and where the cherishing of cultural roots is a national mission. Here, we force talented musicians to run around cap-in-hand to raise cash for their own music schools; &quot;musician&quot; is often uttered with a disparaging curl of the lip, and a prominent jazz critic can dismiss our South African variant of the genre as &quot;tribal pop&quot; -- and get away with it.  Add to that the grotesque resource inequalities inherited from apartheid and you begin to understand why South African musicians don't always deliver on their promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irakere are nothing phenomenal. They are simply a great, jazz-rooted dance band; enormously talented, tight and hardworking -- and out of a cultural context which has made it positive for them to hang together for nearly a quarter of a century to get that way. The fuzzy equivocations of our latest culture White Papers suggest we've a way to go before we reach that point.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Johannesburg's annual Arts Alive Festival might be alive and kicking, but several Gauteng-based artists are digging in their heels over the alleged flagrant &quot;disrespect paid to local talent&quot;, while overseas participants are &quot;treated like royalty&quot;. Poets Lesego Rampolokeng, Lisa Combrinck and Boitumelo Mofokeng are just three of a growing number of enraged artists who have either boycotted or threatened to withdraw from festival events due to inadequate payment for their labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their gripe revolves around the fact that they receive a pittance compared to artists brought in from overseas, such as jazz poet Jane Cortez, who performed at a poetry gala evening at Carfax last Friday night. The performance was held under the auspices of Arts Alive and hosted by The Congress of South African Writers (Cosaw). The Arizona-born Cortez was flown in with her band courtesy of the US Fund for Artists. But Arts Alive coughed up an unspecified amount to make their sojourn as comfortable as possible.  Yet local artists -- particularly those living in surrounding townships -- complain that they are provided with hopelessly inadequate rehearsal space and facilities. Also, they say that their payment barely covers transport to and from the performance venues and that when they request taxi fare they are fobbed off.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rampolokeng, who refused to participate in the Carfax poetry gala event, was also invited by Combrinck and Mofokeng to perform at a poetry reading held at Rand Afrikaans University (Rau) on September 10, organised by Dirk Klopper from that university's English Department. When he inquired about payment he was told that local artists were expected to perform for free. He was later offered the sum of R200, which he angrily refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was told by the Arts Alive organisers that the festival provides exposure for artists and I should be grateful because poets get paid more than musicians for their labour,&quot; he said. &quot;But their attitude is unbelievably arrogant. The organisers are simply into empire- building. I have been to festivals overseas and I have seen that all artists get equal pay. The bottom line is that despite its hype, Arts Alive just uses local artists to boost its credibility, then treats them like shit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combrinck and Mofokeng were initally invited onto the poetry platform at Rau University without being informed that Arts Alive was behind the event.  When they found out they withdrew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Initially we gave our support to the endeavour without thought of payment because we believed we were would be reading to Rau students. But once we heard it was a festival event, we couldn't be associated with it,&quot; says Combrinck, a lecturer in the English Department at Vista University and a Cosaw executive member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The festival has a budget. If it includes sufficient remuneration for international artists, it should also provide adequate payment for local artists&quot;. She adds: &quot;We are not looking for handouts. We simply want respect and recognition. Yet year after year we are faced with inferior facilities, compared to overseas artists, and unequal payment for our labour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arts Alive is essentially a good thing and we welcome genuine exchange between local and international artists,&quot; says Mofokeng. &quot;But it is repeating the mistakes of the past by recognising international artists who essentially contribute nothing to this country at the expense of local artists who are its cultural lifeblood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roshnee Moonsamy, festival manager, insists that international artists invited to South Africa to participate in the festival are funded entirely by overseas agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a non-profit organisation and we treat all artists with the same respect. However, international artists attract bigger audiences than their local counterparts. Their takings at the door help to cover costs incurred during their stay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) today got a shot in the arm when the European Union (EU) gave it a grant of K2.4 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of the delegation of the European Commission in Zambia, Charles Brook, said at the signing ceremony held at COMESA offices in Lusaka that the grant seeks to assist COMESA to further strengthen the foundations of the cross border trade initiative (CBI).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brook said COMESA plays a major role in the process of regional intergration in Africa in an effort to broaden trade and cooperation among member countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this regional intergration in trade would not succeed unless there is a driving force which can both stimulate and coordinate cooperation and action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is for this reason that EU has decided to assist COMESA to accomplish this goal of crossborder initiative which was started in 1992,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And COMESA Secretary General, Dr Bingu Mutharika, thanked the EU saying the grant is a milestone towards the implementation of CBI aimed at promoting cross border trade, investment and payments in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told Mr Brook that COMESA was the first regional organisation in the region to give CBI a political validation due to the complementarity that exists between the activities of COMESA and CBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Mutharika said in targeting the inter-linked areas of crossborder trade, investment and payments through a comprehensive approach, the CBI constitute a substantial step forward towards intergration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed the hope that the reduction of obstacles to cross-border economic activity in the context of CBI would help create growth of economies in many african countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chipata - Minister of state in the office of the president in Malawi, Joseph Kubwalo, has called on the two governments, Zambia and Malawi to introduce a duty-free bilateral trade agreement to curb smuggling between between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Chipata today when he officially opened the Malawi-Zambia Trade Fair Exposition 96, Mr Kubwalo said smuggling of goods was adversely affecting the smooth flow of cross boarder trade between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kubwalo said smuggling between the two countries was a source of worry and we urged the two governments to act without any further delays.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This problem could be resolved if our two governments concluded a duty- free bilateral trade agreement whose draft has been under consideration for nearly two years now,&quot; Mr Kubwalo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kubwalo who commended the Malawi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that the exposition was an eye opener aimed at promoting cross border trade and investment between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the practical measures taken by the private sectors of the two countries should be supported by the two governments as far as possible in order to create an enviroment that was conducive to the development of the bilateral trade and investment flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kubwalo said Malawi's participation in the trade fair was symbolic of his country's practical commitment to the strengthening and consideration of economic and political ties existing between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Malawi and Zambia attached great importance to promotion and strengthening of trade within the region and it was for the same reason that both countries were members of COMESA, SADC and CBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kubwalo said he was happy to note that the diversity and high quality of goods displayed at the show by both countries and this showed that there was a great trade potential between them which should be fully exploited for the mutual benefit of the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the theme of the exposition, which is &quot;produce, process, promote and prosper&quot; Mr Kubwalo said that the theme was appropriate under the circumstances of the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Malawi and Zambia are major producers and exporters of a number of aagricultural and other primary commodities which are exported in raw form to overseas markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kubwalo said that the aim of the trade fair was to encourage and promote further processing of our resource endowments in order to ralise greater spin- offs to our economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need goods which have high unity values. Given the duty free market unfolding in the region, it is imperative for our two countries to look for markets for the processed goods within, thereby ecxploiting the emerging market opportunities,&quot; Mr Kubwalo said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambian professional boxer Joseph Chingangu returned home today with his World International Boxing Federation (IBF) crown - making him earn Zambia the only title not held by Mike Tyson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chingangu, who was flanked by Zambia professional boxing association board chairman Hillary Matyolo, said he will defend his title against Mike Tyson.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to do more training because I want to defend the title, even when it may mean fighting Mike Tyson,&quot; Chingangu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBF crown is the only title Tyson does not have and there is a possibility that he might challenge the new world champion Chingangu for it.  But Chingangu said that he is ready for him and will do anything to defend the title that has elevated Zambia to the international arena of boxing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking today at intercontinental airport on his arrival from Italy where he knocked down Laios Eros in the second round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavily surrounded by government officials and fans, Chingangu, who started professional boxing in 1991, said he has always looked forward to becoming a champion and will work flat out to bring back professional boxing in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 12 round fight only earned him 6,000 United States dollars because his opponent Eros was not the holder of the title but will earn him a lot if he successfully defends it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia has not produced such a boxer before and Matyolo wished the man all the luck and success and going by his strong punches, he was optimistic that he could withstand Mike Tyson.  Source: ZAMTODAY-ZANA</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments have to introduce and develop appropriate technology especially in rural areas to ease the manual labour to which the girl child is subjected, the conference noted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference further called upon African governments to provide education for all girls in mainstream schools through diversification of the educational delivery system and by promoting alternative mode of schooling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The curriculum should be reviewed and made relevant to life during and after school in order to promote the overall interests and concerns of girls in science and technology, gender and civic education and the teaching of life skill, it stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference urged parties concerned to institute, measures to ensure the protection of girls from all forms of insecurity, violence defilement and rape in school, on the way to school and in the community at large.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Defence Ministry has revealed that two of Zambia's neighbours, with the help of a donor country, are in a plot with an opposition political party to unseat the government of President Frederick Chiluba and already the plotters are training the unnamed party's cadres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Defence Secretary in the Ministry of Defence, Colonel Timothy Kazembe, would not name the countries involved nor the European power but he maintained that the army will remain committed to the public service and the defence of the nation and its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colonel Kazembe also said it was not true that the defence force was planning a military coup as alleged by some opposition political party leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently two independent newspapers, the Chronicle and the Post carried front page articles quoting retired Generals Malimba Masheke and Kingsley Chinkuli as having warned the nation of an impending army coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two papers also quoted another retired military man, Colonel Douglas Mbiya, who described the political situation in Zambia as &quot;frightening&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colonel Kazembe said the Ministry of Defence found the statements by retired army commanders now holding senior political positions as irresponsible and subversive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the statements were an attempt to undermine the loyalty and confidence of the defence force to the government of the day and the nation as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It must be noted that the defence force is founded on professionalism consistent with democratic principles, and it operates within the Republican Constitution,&quot; Colonel Kazembe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colonel Kazembe warned political parties not to bring confussion in the defence force by trying to draw its personnel into partisan politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have confidence in the steps that the government is taking to resolve the contentious issues. We, therefore, appeal to political parties to use this avenue to resolve political problems instead of inciting the defence force.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Fifth session of the Seventh National Assembly resumed sitting today at 14.30 hours,after a three month recess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this sitting, parliament is expected to debate and ratify three names of High Court or Supreme Court Judges to be members of the Electoral Commission, following the recent decision by governemnt to make the electoral commission indepepndent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Order Act is also likely to be amended due to the reduction of the notice period, required by any political party to hold a public meeting, from 14 to seven days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pronouncements were made by President Chiluba after the bilateral talks that he held with different political parties including UNIP and ZDC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The house is also expected to dissolve during the same sitting following the expiry of the first five year term of office for the MMD government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And during the last sitting, which adjourned on May 22, MMD members of parliament passed the controversial 1996 Constitution Amendment Bill with no opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba assented the bill despite massive protests from the opposition parties, Non-Governmental Organisations and the donor community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walkouts by the opposition members of parliament characterised the last sitting including the refusal to contribute to debates on the adoption of the 1996 Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The house's sittings ended with the expulsion of National Party (NP) MP for Mongu Central Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika by Speaker of the House Robinson Nabulyato for contempt of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mbikusita-Lewanika later challenged the expulsion and the Supreme Court granted him a stay of execution which the Speaker intends to ignore.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabwe - UNIP leader, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, momentarily relived the bygone days of 'one party-one man' rule last night when the carefully chosen delegates to the party's National Council meeting picked him as sole candidate for the state Presidential elections due in Zambia soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True to the party's long cherished trait of violence and blood letting the meeting almost ended on a tragic note after a group of vengeful UNIP cadres set upon journalists covering the event and two internal security officers from Office of the President (Special Division) who were allegedly attempting to enter Masiye Motel - venue for deliberations of the national council meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trouble started when the two suspected security officers failed to identify themselves by producing their identification cards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party militants demanded that they leave the premises, but when the officers allegedly resisted a fight broke out at the entrance to the reception lounge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the midst of the scuffle, one of the men bolted, leaving his colleague at the mercy of angry party militants who started beating him mercilessly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was only saved by a hotel worker who locked him in one of the rooms for his own safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the blood thirsty crowd of UNIP cadres surged forward and forced its way into the reception lounge demanding to be handed the man 'so we can teach him a lesson' a euphemism for jungle retribution. They shouted insults at the man and accused him of being a &quot;spy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident took place between 21.00 hours and 21.15 hours in full view of journalists covering the UNIP national council and so when it turned out that the alleged spy whom the UNIP thugs had wanted to lynch had been escorted out of the hotel the unruly militants descended on three local journalists covering the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters from the Times of Zambia, Zambia Daily Mail and the Zambia News Agency were showered with insults and rude invectives for their alleged 'biased reporting.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the situation became sticky with some cadres advancing menacingly on them the journalists had to plead their innocence by feebly waving their Press Cards and prayed hard that what had befallen the alleged State Security 'spies' would not befall them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed they would have been lynched had it not been for the providential intervention of Central Province UNIP chairman, Richard Banda, Chairman for finance Rabbison Chongo and youth chairman, Sam Moyo, who saved them from a sure beating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were bitter exchange of words between the Motel attendants and the cadres who demanded that militants leave the reception lounge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the UNIP cadres continued to hurl insults at the journalists accusing them of writing negatively about UNIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As some cadres scrutinised the journalists' press cards others derided and insulted them for no apparent reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later the three journalists had to be shielded and whisked away from obvious danger by Dr Kaunda's press aide, Muhabi Lungu, who explained and pleaded that the three were not &quot; enemies of our party.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the official closing of the council by party president Kenneth Kaunda, Mr Lungu had to escort the pressmen to their vehicle for their own safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chililabombwe - The repatriation of Angolan refugees based in Zambia scheduled to take place this month has been deferred to May 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner for Refugees, Lameck Mwaba, who confirmed this today attributed the postponement to the recent vandalised facilities including tents at a prepared reception camp in Lumbala-Nguimbo district in Angola's Moxico province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mwaba said today that the recent decline by UNITA to let its leader, Dr Jonas Savimbi to take up the position of Vice-President in the proposed unity Angolan government, has had a negative effect on the repatriation exercise of Angola refugees living in Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mwaba said the decision to defer the exercise was reached at a recent tripartite meeting in the Angola capital of Luanda between the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and governments of Angola and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in reviewing the preparations, Angola government officials expressed concern at vandalised facilities at the reception site and proposed that the exercise be deferred to May 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new repatriation date came from Angola government officials themselves.  We were told the reception centre had been vandalised after UNITA expelled aid organisations and their workers from its held Moxico province where Lumbala-Nguimbo district is located,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the expulsion of aid organisations and with no security guards, the centre was left at the mercy of vandals who have ransacked the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stand by UNITA against the vice presidency taken at its third extraordinary congress held in the central highland of Malungo last month, has also affected the repatriation exercise and made some of the refugees who enlisted for voluntary repatriation, be apprehensive about returning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any negative development towards implementing the November 1994 Peace Protocol on Angola is bad news for Angolan refugees,&quot; Mr. Mwaba said without ellaborating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked for a comment, Lusaka-based representative for the UNHCR, Claire Hamlisch, said through a secretary: &quot;All what Mr. Mwaba has told you is correct and there is nothing I can add.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 105,000 of the estimated 360,000 Angolan refugees scattered in about 35 countries are in Zambia. There are 200,000 in Zaire and 12,000 in Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated that the repatriatioin exercise will cost the UNHCR US$44 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans to repatriate the Angolans from Zambia were worked out at a July 1995 meeting in Lusaka between the UNHCR and governments of Angola and Zambia, and fine tuned at a follow-up meeting between the three parties, held in Angola in Luanda, the Angolan capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975 after a bloody liberation war, but fighting broke out around independence between the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and rebel groups, mainly UNITA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hostilities sent thousands of Angolans fleeing to neighbouring Zambia and Zaire as well as other nations. A few returned home after a 1990 peace pact that led to the holding of elections in October 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The re-scheduled repatriation exercise will only take off when the peace process holds in Angola between the two protagonist - UNITA and the Angolan government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Lusaka Stock Exchange's yesterday's Daily Stock News, the shares enjoyed a K4 increase over the privatisation floatation offer price of K11 - a development which the stock exchange has attributed to the heavy discount on the offer price.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The K4 increase probably reflects the fact that the K11 offer price was a 'heavily' discounted price in line with the privatisation objectives of encouraging broad and wide share ownership,&quot;read the stock news in part.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The government is reviewing the employment Act in order to curb discrimination of people living with HIV/AIDS, disclosed National AIDS, STD and Leprosy manager at the ministry of health, Dr Moses Sichone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Sichone, in an interview at a one-day workshop on the 'Protection of Human Rights in the context of AIDS in Africa' organised by the Network of African People living with HIV/AIDS(NAP), said there was need to look at &quot; pieces of legislation that are discriminatory on the basis of HIV and the act is being reviewed accordingly&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that though the epidemic was serious at 25 per cent in urban areas and 13 per cent in rural areas, there was need to work towards reasonable solutions to the problem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That means one person in every four is infected. But rather than introduce restrictive laws against people with HIV/AIDS, we need to harness their efforts in trying to control transmission,&quot; Dr Sichone said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNAIDS country programme advisor Olowo-Freers Bernadette, addressing the same workshop, said fighting human rights violations was high on her organisation's agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The strategic plan is to involve a wide range of partners, NGOs, community based organisations and representatives of people living with HIV/AIDS,&quot; Bernadette said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAP president, David Chipanta, warned that the result of restrictive laws was further spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children and adults with HIV/AIDS should have the same rights as anybody else,&quot; he demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernadette disclosed that 11 million of the population with HIV are found in Africa and thus continent's partnership in the fight against the disease was vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the involvement of people living with the disease in setting the agenda would help to deal with the reality faced by the vulnerable people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We urge governments and societies to wake up from the present conspiracy of silence and find solutions which will eliminate the present divide of 'them' and 'us',&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia's fragile experiment in democracy building is under threat and friends and the international community must urgently move in to save it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the conclusion of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) which visited Zambia on a fact finding mission between August 27 and September 5, this year and the findings are being released today silmuteneously in Lusaka,London and New Dehli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CHRI also warned against any delays in helping Zambia in her situation because &quot;the shortage of time is a critical factor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CHRI which made a 16 point summary of their impressions of the Zambian situation also gave a 13 point recommendation on how Zambia could come out of her situation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the recommendations are that government opens itself up to dialogue, considers a constituent assembly for broadened constitutional debate and desists from forcing an election on Zambians without ironing out the pressing problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On dialogue CHRI says this should include opposition parties beyond the main opposition UNIP. The CHRI also observes that interparty meetings should be chaired by a neutral personality other than any of the heads of the key players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if necessary, recourse could be to the standing asset of the Commonwealth Secretary General or other suitable international personalities,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the CHRI is not dictating an agenda for such talks it specifically says dialogue should concentrate on meeting short terms goals &quot;which would facilitate an early election and limit the need for special extensions of the life of the present parliament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also proposed that the voter registration exercise and the qualifications for the presidential candidates be given special attention in the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CHRI however recommends the re-opening of consensus building on the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government could lower the political temperature markedly by simply making the statement that its recent constitutional amendments were stop gap measures and that it acknowledges the need for a proper national debate of the 1995 constitution commission proposals in constituent assembly,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conclusions and recommendations signed by Kamal Hossain, Anita Raynell Andreychuk and Neville Linton were obtained by The Post last Friday and have been simultaneously released in London and New Delhi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CHRI says the government should not go ahead with an unpopular election merely on account of its 'right' as to do so &quot;might soon force it into the policies of an escalating authoritarianism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It should not risk undermining the gains made through its tough economic programme by now having to put new acute strains on the economy due to the donor's suspension of aid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba has also been urged to maintain moral uprightness and be decisive on indiscipline within his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the office of president is to keep its luster, it is important that the President distances himself convincingly from ministers whose behaviour readily leads to charges of corruption being made, even by donors and from ministers who bring the government into disrepute by seriously ill-judged statements smacking of prejudice or of contempt for the judiciary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They warned further; &quot;In terms of his stewardship President Chiluba, if he is to maintain the international respect which he gained in 199, needs to govern in a manner which ensures that this, the first multiparty regime is marked by fairness, flexibility and progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the CHRI all political parties must ascribe to some code of conduct in the period of elections and uphold their obligation to keep Zambia peaceful by refraining from issuing inflammatory statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CHRI has also recommended that the donor community consider funding opposition parties as a way of strengthening the opposition and consequently democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government has not reacted to this release yet but its four man international relations delegation led by foreign minister Christon Tembo which visited west and north Africa has maintained that all was well for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We went on this trip to West Africa and Egypt to try to clear out the misrepresentation on the government constitutional stance. Everywhere we went, we explained to them that our constitution is what Zambians wanted and we are merely putting up the wishes of all Zambians,&quot; said Tembo at a press briefing shortly after his arrival at the Lusaka International Airport on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, was accompanied by former foreign affairs minister, Vernon Mwaanga, legal affairs minister, Luminzu Shimaponda, deputy minister in the office of the president, Eric Silwamba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four met Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, President Abdul Diouf of Senegal, Konan Bedie of Ivory Coast, Jerry Rawlings of Ghana and Nigerian military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had meetings with the five leaders and afterwards they accepted our stand because they all felt it is an internal matter, and we assured them of continued relations,&quot; said Tembo</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Weary of numerous political factions and as many violated peace accords, Liberians this time around are hopeful that the first-ever lady to hold the mantle of power in their country, will not only restore trust where it had been lost but also put back this West African country on the road to real recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modern Africa's first woman head of state takes over a government -- effectively controlled by fierce warlords -- that has seen the exit of three male predecessors after unsuccessfully attempting to end six years of vicious civil war.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chosen last month following the signing of what has been dubbed &quot;Abuja II&quot; peace accord, Ms Ruth Perry has a tall order of guiding Liberia through disarmament to democratic elections in May 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the 57-year-old former senator from Grand Cape Mount county, Liberia's principal warlords regard her as &quot;their mother.&quot; As such, she counts on their fullest co-operation to sift through the ravages of war and put the country back on its feet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But inevitably, two conclusions await Perry: if she succeeds, one theory is likely to be that she entered the scene when the warlords had already worn themselves out and no longer had the desire to fight on, coupled with threats of sanctions and war crimes tribunal from West African leaders. If she fails, the second and obvious theory would be that cynics would consider it foolhardy on her part to dare tread on where men have failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the outcome of the new transitional government, whichever conclusions are drawn, one thing is certain: Ruth Perry has inscribed her name onto the annals of history. Had it been under normal circumstances, perhaps, messages of congratulations from women leaders would have poured into Monrovia from all corners of the continent, but apparently most women are keeping their fingers crossed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At home, Perry is seen as a no-nonsense woman, though soft-spoken, and one who would deal even-handedly with the rival warlords, unlike the men-folk who have gone before her. She was proposed and unanimously endorsed on August 17 by a special meeting of the committee of nine on Liberia, mandated by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The committee comprises Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Benin and Togo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, held in Nigeria's federal capital, Abuja, was attended by all key Liberian factional leaders, Charles Taylor of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), Alhaji Kromah of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia-K (Ulimo-K), George Boley of Liberia Peace Council (LPC) and Roosevelt Johnson of Ulimo-J. They all signed the new peace agreement, now known as &quot;Abuja II&quot;, which maintains the Transitional Council of State but replaced its head, Wilton Sankawulo, with Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It followed an earlier ECOWAS heads of state summit at the same venue during which West African leaders heavily criticised factional leaders for failure to implement a dozen or so previous peace accords. They were threatened with individual sanctions if any of them obstructs the new plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include travel restrictions, freezing of assets, exclusion from the elections, expulsion of family members from West African countries, restriction of imports and the recommendation to invoke a call for Bosnian and Rwandan-style war crimes tribunals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sankawulo was a product of the first Abuja accord signed in August, 1995.  He replaced David Kpormakpor, who was installed as a result of the July, 1993 Cotonou accord, itself based on &quot;Yamoussoukro IV&quot;. The first interim head of state, Dr. Amos Sawyer, was appointed in 1990 by West African leaders at the height of the civil war, launched by the NPFL in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations estimates that more than 150,000 people have been killed in the civil war. Most recently, over 1,500 people are reported to have been killed when a failed attempt to arrest Ulimo-J leader, Johnson, sparked off weeks of renewed bloody fighting, widespread looting and destruction of property in the capital, Monrovia, from April 6 to May 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new plan provides for all warring factions to complete disarmament and demobilisation of an estimated 60,000 fighters by January 31, 1997. This would be followed by general elections on May 30 and the installation of an elected government on June 15. Members of the current council of state who wish to run for office are expected to resign by the end of February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Perry of her appointment: &quot;The proposition frightened me a bit... I didn't lobby for the job, but the good Lord has made his choice and I will continue to pray for guidance. I told the faction leaders, I have the touch of velvet, but when it comes to taking a firm line I am as hard as steel. We owe this pledge to God and to the Liberian people. We have no illusions and shall endeavour to have no other loyalties to any group or faction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She believes things are different now and the factions would abide by the agreement. &quot;I am going to have a cordial working relationship with the factions, we can't afford to judge them just by the past. I am a very strong woman, I can tell you,&quot; Perry is reported telling Nigerian state television shortly after her appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, things have already begun moving in favour of the new head of state, with Kromah's Ulimo-K faction handing over heavy weapons to the ECOWAS Monitoring Group, ECOMOG, just days after she was officially installed in Monrovia on September 3. The handing over ceremony, attended by Ms Perry and the new ECOMOG Commander, General Samuel Victor Malu, took place on September 7 in Ulimo-K's stronghold of Voinjama, North-Western Liberia, near the Guinean border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports indicate weapons handed over include heavy mortars, anti- aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenades, and Kromah announced he was prepared to stand in elections scheduled for May. &quot;I am seriously available and I think I'm qualified to represent you and will do so when the appropriate time comes, &quot; he told supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECOMOG had requested West African leaders during their July summit to raise the size of its force from 10,000 to 18,000 in order to deploy throughout the country to implement the peace plan. However, fresh troops are yet to be sent to Liberia, although the leaders agreed to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the weapons, General Malu, whose Nigerian contingent is the largest in ECOMOG, said: &quot;The process of disarmament as you have done today should continue and not wait for our deployment. You don't have to wait for other factions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the week, the two feuding Ulimo factions signed a separate agreement to reconcile their differences, thus opening up Western Liberia for relief agencies to reach thousands of starving civilians trapped by factional fighting for the last seven months. Aid workers reaching the provincial town of Tubmanburg speak of desperate conditions for its over 35,000 inhabitants and of people living on wild roots and leaves. The region had been without relief food since February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perry's swearing-in ceremony was marred by fears over the absence of leader of the most powerful faction, Charles Taylor of NPFL,with some suggesting he could be an obstacle to the new plan. But Taylor sought to allay the fears soon after his return to the county by calling on the new state council chairperson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is quoted as reassuring Ms Perry that his absence from the country during the ceremony did not mean hatred for the new head. Taylor outlined plans to disarm and demobilize his fighters and hoped to do so before the official deadline on January 31.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Like in other countries subjected to civil war, the maintenance or even establishment of a formal schooling system has been one of the most difficult tasks in southern Sudan. However, all is not lost as efforts by missionaries working in the area have borne fruit in an alternative in neighbouring Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the many consequences of the protracted civil war in the Sudan has been the virtual breakdown of the formal education system in the country's southern region. But thanks to the spirited efforts of missionaries, a small proportion of southern Sudanese population has had access to some semblance of formal educational, a basic human right.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Determined to keep the fire of enlightenment burning in the midst of the Sudanese gloom, the Comboni Missionaries have established a Ksh.28.5 million (about $500,000) educational institution for the Sudanese on the Kenyan soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Located in Kitale in Western Kenya, about 407 kilometres north-west of Nairobi, Blessed Bakhita Formation Centre was formally inaugurated on August 21, this year, in a colourful ceremony, presided over by Max Macram Gassis, the Bishop of El Obeid in the war-ravaged southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, the inauguration coincided with the capture of some six missionaries in the Sudan by the Sudanese People's Liberation Army-United (SPLA-United) forces. The missionaries, who run an elementary school at the village of Mapourdit were accused of, among other things, hindering SPLA- United recruitment of the young people from their institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six victims who were to be detained for nearly two weeks from August 17 were; three Australian Sisters Moira Lynch, 72, Mary Batchelor, 67, and Maureen Carey, 52, American priest Fr. Michael Barton, 48, Italian Brother Raniero lacomella, 26, and Fr. Raphael Riel, 48, Sudanese Vicar General of Rumbek Diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Named after Josephine Bakhita, a Sudanese slave girl who rose to become a Catholic Sister in Italy, and was later in 1992 proclaimed Blessed by the Pope, the Kitale-based institution will serve the dioceses of Rumbek , El Obeid, Torit and Tambura Yambio. It is a brainchild of Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari, the Apostolic Administrator of Rumbek Diocese and has as its prime objective, the formation of young people as agents of evangelization, education and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those to join the Formation Centre, says Msgr. Mazzolari, will comprise of Sudanese teachers, catechists and seminarians. &quot;They will be duly selected from the most deserving areas and will be asked to give total commitment to their training, contributing also with their work to the running of the Centre and the production of the food needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After training they will be asked to commit themselves to work in their different capacities (catechists, teachers and development agents) at the service of their own people,&quot; Msgr Mazzolari explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre which expects the first lot of 80 students in October, has on its 26-acre compound</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">classrooms, refectory, dormitories and all other physical structures that are necessary for the efficient running of a modern-day learning institution.  All the buildings have been built in a strong but simple and practical style, ensuring that they are easy to maintain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to have the institution in Kenya, and specifically on the outskirts of Kitale town was a well thought idea as Msgr. Mazzolari explained.  It is essentially a rural location, he says, and will allow the students coming from the most isolated areas of Sudan to avoid the impact with the big city centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Blessed Josephine Bakhita Formation Centre has been established in Kitale because the present situation of civil war in southern Sudan does not allow the implementation of any consistent education programme inside Sudan.  Not only is it difficult to find a place and personnel for formation, but the war, as it has been experienced, would continually destabilise any attempt at the formation of the youth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Msgr Mazzolari, who has been in charge of the Rumbek Diocese since 1991 went on to explain: &quot;In southern Sudan, the formal education system has ground to a halt for more than 10 years. Many Catholics have been left without a priest for 10 to 15 years. While the old catechists and teachers have done an incredible work and shown a lot of dedication, there is the need for a new generation of catechists, teachers and development agents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya offers a good atmosphere for teaching and studying. Teaching staff in all subjects can easily be found. The young people would be able to concentrate in their studies without being continually subjected to distress and appeal from their families and the villages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1983, Southern Sudan has been fighting a bloody war with the Islamic regime in Khartoum. The bone of contention has been the desire by the southerners, who are mostly Christians and traditionalist, to have all their fundamental rights recognised by the Islamic government. At the onset of the war, the southerners fought under one rebel group, SPLA-United, led by Colonel John Garang. With time, however, internal conflicts within the SPLA- United have given rise to several factions that have seen the southerners turn against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this day, it is estimated that not less than 1.2 million lives have been lost in the war. Hundreds of thousands have suffered injuries of various nature and degree while equally large numbers have been forced into exile especially in the neighbouring states. Thus the several consequences of the Sudanese war have spilled well beyond the expansive state's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Fr. Robert Tumukwase, who is the first head of the institution, Blessed Bakhita Formation Centre has four permanent teaching staff. There is provision for involvement of resource persons from outside whenever there is need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what would become of the centre if normalcy returned to the Sudan? Msgr.  Mazzolari says; &quot;While it is hoped that the conflict in Sudan will end soon, the period of rehabilitation for civil society as well as for the church at all levels will take a long time. So the Bakhita Centre will continue to be useful for many years to come, even if the peace and justice we all pray for will come tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fr. Tumukwase hopes that the Sudanese will leave the centre for Kenyans.  When such a time comes, the Comboni Missionaries, who are the trustees of the institution, &quot;will use it according to the needs of the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A lot of &quot;positive attractions&quot; that are said to lure youth and other faithful from mainline, traditional or historical churches to new charismatic religious groups on the one hand and to independent or indigenous churches on the other, continue to be debated. Now Rt. Rev. Dr. Paul Kofi Fynn, President of the Lutheran Church in Ghana discusses some shortcomings of both the new groups and historical churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most if not all African independent or indigenous churches have incorporated indigenous cultural traditions into their worship and other socio-religious ceremonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the new charismatic Christian movements have lively but equally long worship services. But their Bible readings and sermons are shorter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sermons are, however, particularly more powerfully eloquent in praising the Lord than relating the Gospel to the non-spiritual day- to-day problems of the followers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nevertheless, some of what appear to be pluses may be enough to lure a number of baptised Christians within the historical churches to the new groups,&quot; admits Rt. Rev. Dr. Paul Kofi Fynn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the mainline churches were to carry out a genuine and critical self- analysis they would stem &quot;this undesirable flow,&quot; he contends. He adds: &quot; Mainline churches have an edge over all others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Fynn appreciates the new efforts of &quot;other churches&quot; to win more souls for Jesus. This would go a long way in establishing &quot;God's Kingdom on earth where peace, caring love, unity, reconciliation, and dignity for all human beings is the norm rather than the exception.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His concern, however, is that their gospel is based purely on biblical truth which they take as given. The knowledge and changed historical, social and cultural circumstances of later-day generations is assumed to be irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exclusive concern of the charismatic groups in particular is spiritual salvation, sometimes making doctrines out of single verses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the social, political and economic situation of the human being, this has inevitably been predetermined by God and only Jesus can change it, perhaps miraculously. Not surprisingly, dictatorial regimes and authoritarian local administration officials find the new groups and some indigenous churches a relief to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence in Kenya for instance, the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) finally split into two in 1995, with a breakaway group forming the Regional Fellowship of Churches of Kenya (RFCK).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RFCK is more pentecostal, evangelistic or charismatic in membership and orientation. It seeks, it would appear, to distance itself from the more worldly social, political and economic concerns that affect Christians and non-Christians alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dominated by mainline churches, the NCCK on the other hand continues not only to be concerned with evangelization and the spiritual needs of the people, but also with the social economic and political issues of the day as they affect the populace. &quot;Spiritualization and 'engagement in society' is the full mission of the church,&quot; NCCK argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent move, the RFCK has vowed to disrupt NCCK peace and reconciliation seminars. Initiated in areas worst hit by tribal clashes at the hight of the clamour for multipartism in the early 1990s, President Moi has termed the seminars as &quot;subversive activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On spiritual matters however, charges Dr. Fynn, mainline churches have failed to explain in a clear, penetrating and easily discernible language or fashion some fundamental religious doctrines and issues. These include such matters as trinity, the Holy Spirit and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often these have been explained away simply as mysteries because &quot;lucky are those who believe without seeing.&quot; The insistence on the &quot;mystery of speaking in tongues and on miracles&quot; on the part of charismatics has been equally harmful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But today, people are more educated and learned in modern disciplines that have made them more inquisitive, says Dr. Fynn. They will therefore go to groups that either put less emphasis on such fundamental issues or provide answers to these mysteries however superfluous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the major faults of mainline churches is eliticism of church leaders and institutions. This contradicts the brotherhood prescribed in the scriptures. There are now &quot;inner circles&quot; and at the same time &quot;strangers&quot; within congregations instead of fellowship, says Dr. Fynn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some elites have reserved seats on the pews irrespective of their apparent conduct. When elites want to baptize their children or are in need of funeral services, no &quot;embarrassing questions&quot; are asked, he adds. &quot;These are reserved for the more lowly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the independent churches as well as in charismatic movements, real brotherhood flourishes both in times of happiness and sadness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When death occurs, unemployment hits or marriage takes place in a family, it becomes a collective concern of the entire group that worships together.  This solidarity is reminiscent of the early church, and it is a major attraction given today's social economic hardships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Fynn recommends a minimal interest (as in his church) or completely interest free revolving fund to help Christians start small enterprises as one way of fighting unemployment, dependency and alleviating poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A related phenomenon is the domineering relationship between the church and clergy, and their followers. The relationship which, however, is found in both groups is manifest in excessive belief in the established institution of the church or its pastors than in God and the Holy Spirit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a stand on fundamental issues such as Christian doctrines and worship must be firmly elucidated, Dr. Fynn argues, there is a need for flexibility, tolerance of constructive criticism and willingness to learn new things and experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting the Bible, Dr. Fynn also urges mainline churches to make their services not only more lively but also more participatory, because afterall &quot; priesthood is for all believers.&quot; The clergy may be trained but they do not have the monopoly of gifts of the Holy Spirit, he declares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something also needs to be done about the length of services and sermons.  The same goes for &quot;the three readings which sometimes are not even readily connected,&quot; making theological sense only to the priest but confusing to worshippers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born to parents who could neither read nor write, Rt. Rev. Fynn knows only that he was born on a Friday because of his middle name, &quot;Kofi&quot;. Kofi in his native language means Friday, after which he was named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving his secular education in Ghana, he stayed with a Lutheran missionary from the United States. It was through this experience that he made the decision to attend seminaries in Obot Edim in Nigeria and in Makumira, Tanzania in the late 1960s. He later did a certificate course in journalism at the Africa Literature Centre at Kitwe in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also studied in the United States in the greater Chicago area, earning a bachelor of arts degree from Wheaton College and a master of arts degree in journalism from Northwestern University. Following his graduation he worked for two years as a journalist for the Chicago Tribune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After returning to Ghana, he became pastor of St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Accra, which he continues to serve today without salary as a &quot;worker-priest.&quot; He received an honorary doctor of divinity degree in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As president of the Lutheran Church in Ghana, since 1978, the number of Lutherans in Ghana increased from 4,000 to 20,000 in five years and continues to rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to his priestly vocation, Dr. Fynn is an accomplished businessman. He is engaged in commercial mixed farming, trucking and taxi businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He started business as a taxi driver when he was already a priest. He borrowed money to buy his first taxi which he drove himself whenever he was not pastoring to his flock. Dr. Fynn is married and has three children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS - The head of the United Methodist Church in Nigeria went on the air on September 15 to defend his decision to ordain women as priests, saying it was time to end sexual discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The church has been discriminating against women for so many years for no just reasons,&quot; Sunday Mbang said in last weekend's television interview, and maintained that &quot;most of the reasons advanced by those opposed to it are cultural.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There should be democracy in the church...We should not deprive women of leadership positions in the church,&quot; Mbang said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbang stirred up controversy in Christian circles with his announcement on September 12 that the Methodist Church in Nigeria had decided at its recent annual conference, in Ikot-Ekpene in south-eastern Akwa Ibom state, to ordain women as priests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The training, qualification, screening and ordination of women to priesthood would be on the same terms as their male counterparts, and that women will be trained, just like men, and their grade would not be lowered, nor would anybody who is not qualified or deserved the post be given any opportunity, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than one-third of all Nigerians are Christians and some 45 per cent of the national population of more than 100 million are Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbang, who is also the national president of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), pointed out that Methodist women were already being ordained as priests in England and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this decision, the Methodist Church of Nigeria became the first member of the CAN to approve the ordination of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early last year, an attempt by the Ilorin diocese of the Anglican Communion in Nigeria to ordain women as priests was rejected by the Anglican Church hierarchy and the three women who were ordained by the Anglican bishop of Ilorin diocese were later de-robed by the headquarters of the Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic Church in Nigeria is still opposed to the ordination of women as priests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAWOLO, UGANDA - A prayer book modelled on one commonly used in the Christian faith has been produced by followers of traditional religion in Uganda. It is published in Luganda, the language of Uganda's largest ethnic group (Baganda) comprising about 3 million people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new pagan rites prayer book, Ebiggwa By'abalanzi (Temples of the Prophets), was launched at the industrial town of Kawolo near Kampala on September 10, during a get together of the Traditional Healers and Herbalists Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chairman of the association, Ssalongo Ben Ggulu, told a big gathering at the function that the book was &quot;an answer to an outcry by healers for a suitable prayer book for use particularly at funerals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ggulu said quite often, believers in traditional religions were denied a decent funeral by Christian and Muslim priests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faithful of other religions were advised to stop despising traditionalists.  Said Ggulu to his followers during the launch: &quot;Followers of our faith, you must stop begging Christian and Muslim priests to pray for your dead since the government recognises us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer book is divided into sections including common prayer, readings, canons of traditional belief, hymns for funerals and last funeral rites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the authors of the book, a healer named Katumba, lamented that for a long time traditionalists had been ridiculed as pagans &quot;yet many Christians and Muslims frequent our shrines.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LILONGWE - The Catholic Church in Malawi has launched a massive national ecclesiastical programme, aimed at preparing the faithful for the third millennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a pastoral letter, Walking Together in Faith: Our Journey Towards the year 2000, released here on September 14, the Episcopal Conference of Malawi said the programme designed under three phases from March 1996-2000 would also help the local Catholic church implement recommendations of the historic 1994 African synod as requested by Pope John Paull II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national ecclesiastical programme will also prepare local Christians for the year 2001 centenary celebrations marking the arrival of the first Catholic missionaries in this Southern African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our church has grown from very humble beginnings with four White Fathers who arrived at Mponda village in Mangochi district south- east of the country, on December 28, 1889, and three Montfort Missionaries, who reached Port Herald in Nsanje district, south of the country, on June 24, 1901, to what it is today,&quot; the Malawian Catholic bishops said in their pastoral letter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving a breakdown of Malawian faithful in the church, the bishops said their country of 11 million people has some 1.9 million Catholics who include 65,800 catechumens, 270 priests, more than 560 religious and eight bishops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are impressive and encouraging statistics. However, the cause of appreciation and rejoicing depends more upon whether Christian values have become part of us and whether our lives influenced and shaped our social and cultural values,&quot; the Catholic clergy observed in their pastoral letter signed by seven bishops among them the Conference chairman Bishop Mkhori (Diocese of Chikwawa) and the Archbishop of Blantyre James Chiona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We encourage you to keep your eyes directed towards the Father, who beckons and calls us to go beyond our limited possibilities and by our witness of life enable all to be transformed into God's &quot;own image and likeness. In this way all of us will be part of the great human pilgrimage to the house of the Father,&quot; the bishops have appealed to the faithful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the programme, each diocese will adapt the national plan to suit its local situation. And the diocesan commission, guided by the bishop, shall have the duty to co-ordinate and direct the jubilee preparations and the implementation of the African synod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On their contribution to the nation, the Malawian clergy said; &quot;As Catholics, we can modestly be proud and grateful for the contribution we have made and are making in the fields of education, health and human development in our beloved country, Malawi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops vowed to continue to do whatever is within their power to minister to the sick and needy, especially those suffering from HIV/AIDS which threatens all and takes &quot;so many of our dear ones, and leaves so many widowed and orphaned open to every kind of injustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on their famous 1992 pastoral letter, Living our Faith, the first ever since independence to openly challenge democratic governance in Malawi, the bishops said; &quot;We give thanks to the Lord that by his grace we were able, through that letter, to be the &quot;voice of the voiceless at that critical moment of the history of our young nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since then, with the various contributions of Malawians, our sister churches, here at home and abroad as well as individuals and organizations overseas, Malawi has peacefully achieved a democratic society in a multi- party system,&quot; the Catholic bishops noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops also underscored the need to improve their manner and methods of evangelisation. They noted that in the past their orientation has been towards mass conversions rather than individual conversion, tending to preach a gospel of fear with emphasis on evil and fires of hell instead of on the God of love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They resolved to plan better formation programmes for all agents of evangelization and especially devise training programmes geared towards empowering the laity in their tasks of evangelization and building the church, and fostering a truly human society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Malawian clergy also condemned corruption in very strong terms, vowing to join all those who courageously speak out against this malpractice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This evil must be removed from our society. We urge you to say NO to this sin, which has become a way of life for some,&quot; they urged their fellow countrymen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA - Burundian soldiers have recovered the bodies of the country's assassinated Roman Catholic archbishop, Joachim Ruhuna, and that of a nun who was murdered with him, a military spokesman announced here on September 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Longin Minani said the bodies were found buried in a field after Hutu rebels and troops of the Tutsi-dominated army exchanged fire on Mwumba hillside, not far from the scene of the killings in central Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruhuna, a member of the Tutsi minority regarded as a man of peace and reconciliation in a country torn by ethnic violence, died on September 9, along with the nun and another woman travelling with him, in an ambush during which his car was also set on fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army, which restored Major Pierre Buyoya to power in a bloodless coup on July 25, has blamed rebels of the Hutu majority for the attack, but the guerrillas in turn blamed the military.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minani said soldiers spotted a group of &quot;terrorists&quot; in a sorghum field on the hillside north of the central town of Gitega and three kilometres from the site of the ambush early on September 17, leading to the rebels first opening fire and the soldiers shooting back. The guerrillas then fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after searching the area, the soldiers found freshly turned earth in the sorghum field. They dug and found the two bodies, but as they did not recognise them, their commander then went to Gitega, Minani added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The corpses, which bore gunshot wounds, were identified by a priest from the archbishop's diocese in Gitega and a doctor who were taken to the field.  It took five hours for the army to get the bodies back to the road, Minani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of the archbishop's staff told journalists that the bodies would be buried in Gitega on September 19 after a requiem mass to be said at 9:30 a.  m. (7:30 GMT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four other people who were travelling with the archbishop were found alive after the attack. They included the driver, who was shot and wounded, but who said that a &quot;crowd of people, some almost in rags, but armed to the teeth&quot; had attacked the car, which was &quot;riddled with bullets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 17, the army said it was certain that the Forces for the Defence of Democracy, the armed wing of the main Hutu organisation, the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), killed the archbishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, CNDD spokesman Jerome Ndiho has denied responsibility, saying that &quot;as opposed to the rest of the Catholic hierarchy -- strongly pro-Tutsi and discriminatory -- Monsignor Ruhuna was a man of reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discovery of the bodies came as Hutu rebels continued to intensify their bloody campaign against the minority Tutsi-regime in Burundi. They wounded at least four people in ambushes on the highway between Burundi's capital Bujumbura and Gitega in the centre of the country, the army announced here on September 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An army officer, his wife and another person were injured on September 17 afternoon in an attack at Rutegema, 70 kilometres east of Bujumbura, while a civilian was wounded in nearby Gatabo the same day, military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebels also carried out an ambush at Matongo, 77 kilometres north- east of the capital, but the casualty toll was not known, an informed source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethnic strife between the Hutu majority and Tutsis who dominate the armed forces has rocked Burundi for three years now. The fighting has escalated into a civil war which has claimed more than 150,000 lives, according to the London-based human rights organisation, Amnesty International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conflict flared up after the assassination of the first Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, in October 1993, the year he took over from Buyoya following Burundi's first free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya, who seized back control two days after Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya took refuge in the United States embassy called for calm following the cleric's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let nobody use this unhappy event as a pretext to perpetrate acts of vengeance or plunge into extremism,&quot; Buyoya said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pope's special envoy Cardinal Jozef Tomko called for an end to the slaughter in Burundi in an emotional plea at a memorial service for Ruhuna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the name of God, it is up to you, the political leaders, members of different parties, the military and armed groups, to stop massacring the people of Burundi, to stop the killing,&quot; Cardinal Tomko pleaded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA - Two bishops of the (Anglican) Church of Uganda have indicated the church will oppose the imminent human trials of the HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) vaccines called ALVAC-HIV vaccine, if a number of outstanding issues are not resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principal fears are over safety considerations but legal, ethical and social issues are also outstanding. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is expected to make a final ruling on the matter following recommendations of a recent workshop that Ugandans should participate in the vaccine trials. The HIV vaccine trials conference was held in Kampala from September 8 to 10.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Michael Senyimba of Mukono Diocese said emphatically: &quot;True the church is tired of conducting endless funerals but the end does not justify the means. Measures have to be taken to ensure that people made in the image of God are not used as subjects to be disposed of when the experiments fail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired Bishop Misaeri Kauma who is the chairman of Uganda's AIDS Commission equally wanted to be sure that Ugandans were not unduly being exposed to danger by the vaccine trials. He commented; &quot;The church is the people and the people need to know whether it is safe before we start these trials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof. Roy Mugerwa of the Medical School, Makerere University said trials of the vaccines have already been conducted in the United States, France, Thailand, Brazil and China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda had been chosen because of the high prevalence of HIV in the population. It is believed as many as 1.5 million out of Uganda's population of 18 million people are HIV positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participation in the trials is entirely voluntary but Prof. John Rwomushana of Uganda AIDS Commission called for an independent counselling body in the recruitment of volunteers to ensure participants were fully aware of what they were doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop heard that many parents in Mukono and Tororo District were now scared of taking their children for routine immunization against the six killer diseases such as polio and tuberculosis, for fear that their children would be injected with the French-made experimental vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paul Kaggwa of Uganda's Ministry of Health Education Department said parents in Mukono &quot;related national immunization days to the AIDS vaccine trial and were pessimistic about ordinary post-natal vaccines.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONROVIA - The full scale of human suffering in the western Liberia town of Tubmanburg emerged recently as aid workers reached there for the first time in seven months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows a ceasefire between two rival Ulimo factions operating in the area, about 70 kilometres from the capital, Monrovia. Relief agencies withdrew from Tubmanburg in Bomi county last February when fresh fighting broke out between the United Liberation Movement in Liberia-J (Ulimo-J) and Ulimo-K, leaving thousands of people without food and medical supplies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many fled their homes into the surrounding jungle following harassment by rebels, and have been barely surviving on wild roots, leaves and fruits.  Scores, probably hundreds have died of starvation. Reports quote aid workers as saying skeletal, pot- bellied children discovered in the town displayed some of the worst symptoms of malnutrition seen in the country's seven-year- old civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 150 severely malnourished children were evacuated to a special feeding centre in Monrovia. The Chairman of the Ruling State Council, Ms Ruth Perry, is reported to have broken down and wept after seeing a video taken from Tubmanburg to the capital by aid workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the worst thing we have seen in the seven-year history of the war in Liberia,&quot; an official with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), told journalists. The aid workers estimate that over 80 per cent of the town's 35,000 population is seriously malnourished, adding that hundreds of civilians have emerged from the forest as word of relief operations spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hundreds have emerged from the jungle along the road to Tubmanburg. We set up a distribution point along that road today (September 11),&quot; Daniela Deane of the World Food Programme (WFP) is quoted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">telling reporters. The precise death toll arising out of widespread hunger is difficult to gauge, but local people have been quoted saying up to 16 people have been dying daily before relief arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In neighbouring Grand Cape Mounty close to the Sierra Leonean border, however, skirmishes have continued between the two factions, making it difficult for relief workers to reach about 3,000 starving people trapped there. And Ms Perry has appealed to the factions to stop fighting and allow help to reach the needy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, reports reaching APS shortly before going to press indicate that two generals of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), led by Charles taylor, have been arrested and detained by George Boley's Liberia Peace Council (LPC) in Grand Gedeh County, to the south-east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPFL generals were part of a joint assessment team, including the two factions, officials from the Economic Community of West African States intervention force, ECOMOG, UN Observer Mission and the United States embassy.  The men were arrested shortly after a helicopter landed in an area of Grand Gedeh controlled by LPC, who demanded that the team proceed to Greenville in neighbouring Sinoe County. Each of the two factions claims it is occupying Greenville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPFL generals were arrested in the presence of all the officials, and observers say the incident threatens to derail the entire peace process. The team immediately abandoned its mission and returned to Monrovia, and urgent negotiations are said to be underway to defuse the tension and release the men.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI - The All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) peace prize has been given a higher profile and will now be referred to as the AACC Desmond Tutu Peace Prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was decided at the just-ended annual General Committee meeting in Douala, Cameroon from September 10 to 13.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Setri Nyomi, the Executive Secretary of the Christian and Family Life Education department and a member of the committee, revealed that the members saw it fitting to award a peace prize at every</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Nyomi said the name &quot;Desmond Tutu&quot; was in recognition of the retired South African Archbishop's efforts in reversing the distressing trend of civil strife in South Africa and Africa as a whole. The former head of the Anglican Church in South Africa is also the current president of the AACC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first AACC peace prize was awarded before the 1992 General Assembly to Anglican Archbishop Dinis Segulane of Mozambique.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Prof. Jesse Mugambi, a member of the AACC General Committee, it was necessary to acknowledge the two clergymen because initially the idea was to form a Lutheran body but the two argued for a body that would accommodate all churches in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The properties named include a five storey building that houses various international organizations and the AACC headquarters in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS - Nigerian police have warned Islamic extremists that they would face a tough response if they used violence to try to free their leader, who was arrested after bloody clashes on September 13, the Nigerian press reported on September 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief in the northern Kaduna state, where at least six people were killed and several hurt in fighting between fundamentalists and police, told reporters to &quot;tell them that if they want to commit suicide, we have our men on the ground and they are ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they are bent on breaking the laws of the land, we are ready to break their legs,&quot; the independent Guardian and Tribune dailies quoted state commissioner of police Yakuba Sahibu as saying.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 16, Islamic extremists in northern Nigeria warned that they will launch a holy war if the authorities failed to free their chief, who was arrested after clashes with police left six dead, according to press reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundamentalists in Zaria in Kaduna state said they would begin their jihad or holy war, if the security services did not free Sheikh Ibrahim Ahmad Zak-Zaki by September 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of the preacher battled police in Zaria on September 13 at the cost of six lives, according to police figures, but independent press reports said the toll could be higher, while a fundamentalist said that 14 people were shot dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaibu said that police did not open fire and only used tear gas to disperse demonstrators, adding: &quot;In fact, they may have tied wood together and put it in coffins and claimed that the police killed their members to attract public sympathy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a Zaria Muslim reached by telephone on September 17, Mohammed Ciroma, dismissed this allegation and said his movement would soon produce proof of its claims, including videotapes of the victims and the spent bullets fired by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ciroma neither confirmed nor denied the press reports about the warning of a jihad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clashes in Zaria followed a demonstration by Muslim fundamentalists protesting against the arrest on September 12 of the 34-year-old sheikh Zak- Zaki, a mystic preacher renowned for inflammatory sermons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was detained with at least 20 of his supporters after battles on September 8 between Shiite Muslims and Christians in another Kaduna state town, Kafanchan, where at least two people were killed and 15 injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A section of the press on September 16 reported that Zak-Zaki was believed to have been transferred to a detention centre in Port Harcourt at the other end of the country, on the coast in the southern Rivers State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security forces in the north were placed on a state of high alert at the weekend, when witnesses said that police and army roadblocks had been set up on the road from Zaria to Kaduna town and along the main routes linking Kaduna state with the neighbouring states of Kano and Katsina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to his associates, Zak-Zaki has already spent nearly nine years in prison because of his militant activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaibu has since stated that Zak-Zaki's arrest was completely unrelated to the violence in Kafanchan, saying that instead, the sheikh had been held for producing and presenting illegal radio programmes, jamming and using the frequencies of the government-owned radio in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Nigeria is populated mainly by Muslims, who form about 45 per cent of the country's total population of more than 100 million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE - Zimbabwe's electrical engineers have installed lightning strike detectors on 26 locations countrywide in an ongoing exercise which will eventually see the whole country's lightning distribution system mapped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project, at a cost of more than Zimbabwe dollars 700,000 (about US$70, 000) is being jointly undertaken by a parastatal, the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) and the University of Zimbabwe's Department of Electrical Engineering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe has a high lightning strike toll. On average 250 people in this southern African country are killed by lightning each rainy season. Related information will be of vital importance to the country as the general lightning pattern will be determined. Initial indications are that lightning activities increase as one moves towards the Zambezi Valley which is in the country's northern borders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectors, which cover a radius of 20 kilometres each, are being installed at ZESA establishments in Bindura, Chinhoyi, Marondera, Mutare Rural, Masvingo, Kwekwe, Gweru, Bulawayo and Hwange. Other districts will be covered later. ZESA officials will collect data and pass it on to the Department of Electrical Engineering for further analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudden black-outs and other electrical faults on households are sometimes a common feature in Zimbabwe's residential areas during the rainy seasons. Most of the faults are attributed to direct lightning strikes on installations, and trees falling on power lines as a result of the strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Available data shows that over 90 per cent of ZESA's faults are caused by lightning. It is hoped that this information on lightning will help ZESA in routing its transmission lines and in the design and location of substations.  It will also help Zimbabweans to desist from building homesteads in areas that are prone to lightning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various theories have been advanced about lightning, with some Zimbabweans believing that some people are capable of directing killer lightning bolts to their foes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About two years ago, ZESA exhibited some lightning conductors designed mainly for rural communities but the response so far has been hopelessly poor.  Given that the conductors are relatively cheap, this reaction may be explained by ignorance and superstition on how lightning operates among the majority of the peasants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most huts in the communal lands (where the majority of the country's population lives) are built of pole-and-dagga (mud-walled) and usually grass- thatched, thereby making them vulnerable to lightning strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an international conference on lightning conductors in 1995 which was held in Harare, a traditional healer challenged scientists to stand on a platform so that he could demonstrate whether he could not create or redirect a lightning bolt. None of the scientists took up the challenge!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, South Africa is the only African country which has a map with isokeraunic curves - lines showing places with similar lightning activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this project is completed Zimbabwe will be the second to have such a map.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON - Although Cameroon's Transport Sector Project is well intentioned, the way World Bank officials have gone round the planning of the project has created doubts in the minds of some environmental campaigners who say the country's environment has been sacrificed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the project goes ahead, it would help rehabilitate and maintain some of the country's worst kept road networks especially the Abang Mbang - Lomie and the Gari Gombo - Moloundou roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the project has run into controversy with the London-based Friends of the Earth (FOE), leading a campaign to prevent it from taking off because it is likely to destroy one of Africa's best rainforests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Bank staffers argue that &quot;delaying the improvement of road maintenance country-wide would contribute to the isolation of rural communities, and thus have a detrimental effect on poverty alleviation and the protection of the environment.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project itself shows how World Bank staffers mislead their officers to force projects that would otherwise not have taken off. The World Bank is trying to force the government of Cameroon to go ahead with a road project that the African Development Bank (ADB) withdrew from because of the effects that it would have on the country's environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOE says &quot;one of the roads on the map is a pure and simple logging road that ADB rejected on environmental grounds following an environmental assessment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to FOE, it has secret document to show that &quot;World Bank staff misled their own Board of Directors in order to force through a project that will lead to new logging&quot; in the area considered Africa's most spectacular rainforest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A memo dated May 16, 1996 and written by a World Bank staffer Robert Tillman, which APS has seen, said the United States Treasury had raised concerns on the project and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has written to the US Environment Department &quot;asking for postponement and to oppose the project.&quot; The Rain Forest Coalition has contacted the UK Environment Department to raise the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result of the map, it appears that we may be funding road maintenance that ADB rejected and without our own environmental assessment,&quot; Tillman added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A technical team sent to assess the project also said &quot;the road was never considered for funding since they will focus on high traffic roads nearer urban centres and markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is very serious opposition to the project and it is possible that the US Environment Department will either abstain or oppose the project and is likely to be joined by the UK Environment Department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another memo, Tillman suggested that &quot;assurance should be sought that the annual review of the road maintenance programme to be organized with the participation of sector stakeholders, Government and donors representatives should include specific environment criteria and should verify that a satisfactory mitigation plan is in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But according to the Friends of the Earth, one Maryvonne and her team operating in Cameroon drafted a letter purported to have been written by the Government of Cameroon, indicating that environmental precautions had been taken for all the maintenance and rehabilitation work to go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tillman then wrote in a memo that &quot;I have received the letter and Maryvonne is going to send us a copy in English and French.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the tricks that the World Bank staffers used in attempting to force the implementation of the project, Tony Juniper, FOE's deputy campaigns director said &quot;the World Bank is a smoke screen behind which environmental and social destruction is carried forward in the name of development. World Bank policies to protect forests and the poor are not worth the paper they are written on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the UK's executive director of the World Bank is British, FOE says &quot; the British government must demand an inquiry and heads must roll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the executive director was initially against the project, it has now been proved that he voted in favour of the project on May 30, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization has also decided to lobby UK MPs not to approve money for the World Bank.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JINJA-EASTERN UGANDA - A report by the Anglican Church of Uganda indicates that the formation of many dioceses is the cause of financial problems in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was disclosed by the Church of Uganda Provincial Secretary, the Rev.  Canon William Magambo, in a press interview on September 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the House of Bishops had decided that no new dioceses would be formed within the existing ones in the province until 1998.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Magambo was reacting to a report that Kamuli and Iganga archdeaconaries in Busoga Diocese, eastern Uganda, which support Bishop Cyprian Bamwoze's leadership, were seceding from Busoga Diocese and forming their own fully-fledged dioceses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A leadership wrangle in Busoga diocese has been going on for the last four years with one section of the laity saying they did not recognise the Rev.  Bamwoze as bishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Bishops, under the chairmanship of Archbishop Livingstone Nkoyoyo decided two months ago to retire Bishop Bamwoze prematurely in February next year, to allow the cooling off of tempers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Bamwoze is currently on forced sabbatical leave until next year. He is to retire in 1997 although he would be reaching the retirement age a year later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The retirement of Bishop Bamwoze seems not to have satisfied all parties concerned. No sooner was the bishop's retirement made public than several archdeaconaries supporting him announced they would form new dioceses, separate from Busoga diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, a committee set up by the House of Bishops to look into the problems of Busoga diocese, recommended that the diocese be split into three dioceses so that Bishop Bamwoze could take one where he had support. But the Bishop and his supporters as well as enemies said they were opposed to the splitting up of the diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, there were efforts to create more sees in the central region kingdom of Buganda so that the kingdom could set up its own province, independent of the Province of the Church of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laity in Buganda were at the time complaining bitterly that although the first Protestant missionaries arrived in their kingdom and set up churches there before moving to other parts of the country, no Muganda had been elected Archbishop of the Church of Uganda up to then. Partly due to their pressures, the House of Bishops last year elected his Grace Livingstone Nkoyooyo as Archbishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Magambo said due to demands from several parts of the country for the creation of new sees, the House of Bishops had instituted a committee to visit those places which want to form new dioceses and provide a report to be considered in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country with more than 40 ethnic groups, there has been a tendency in the church to create tribal bishops who have been sent to administer in their home regions. There has been a struggle therefore, for every tribe to clamour for a bishop from their own kind as a form of parity among several tribal groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever dioceses have been created, the Christians in the area have been forced to contribute towards the purchase of an expensive vehicle for the bishop, construct and furnish a big residence for him and his family and contribute every Sunday for his fat salary and upkeep.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - Following are excerpts from the Report on the Impact of the UN Sanctions against Libya which was transmitted to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali by the Libyan Mission to the UN in September 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixth comprehensive report on damage caused by the implementation of Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) during the period from 15 April 1992 to 31 December 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The substantial damage caused in the humanitarian, economic and social spheres by the coercive and unjust measures taken against the Libyan Arab people under Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) continues to worsen day by day. In addition, all infrastructure development programmes and plans have been adversely affected, thereby dashing the hopes and aspirations of the Libyan Arab people to achieve progress, well-being, development, stability, security and peace. Some particulars of the enormous physical, material and financial damage sustained by the Libyan people during the period indicated above are given hereunder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HUMANITARIAN CONSEQUENCES -- HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sector aims to provide for the health care and social well-being for all members of society and to achieve the noble goals established by the international community through its international and regional organizations and agencies. The goal of &quot;Health for All&quot; must be pursued so that all social groups and segments of society can make solid progress and objectives in the areas of health and social welfare can be achieved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this connection, it should be pointed out that the sector has sustained enormous material and humanitarian damage, affecting the Libyan population as a whole and most of the expatriates from Arab and other friendly countries living in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, as can be seen from the following examples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Some 15,750 persons living in the Jamahiriya are suffering from serious medical conditions (cardiovascular disease; fractures of the spinal column and thorax; fractured skulls; chronic eye diseases; detached retinas: serious burns; cancer and malignant tumours) which require emergency treatment (neurosurgery; spinal marrow transplants; kidney transplants; corneal transplants; fitting of prostheses). Owing to the continuation of the aerial embargo, these individuals, who could not be treated in local hospitals and health-care facilities, could not be evacuated by air for treatment in other countries or for necessary medical examinations and surgery in hospitals and specialized health-care facilities with modern equipment. Because they could not obtain treatment, most of these patients died in tragic circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. More than 780 seriously injured patients (most of whom were the victims of road accidents) died in ambulances en route to airports in neighbouring countries so that they could be transported by air for treatment abroad in spite of the difficulties of the overland journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There have been 1,135 stillbirths and 514 women have died in childbirth in the various hospitals owing to the shortage of medicines, serums and vaccines. Prior to the aerial embargo, such supplies had been imported regularly by air, with the usual precautions being taken to preserve their efficacy and usability. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was able in that way to meet its needs in this area, particularly in emergency situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Owing to the aerial embargo and the consequent increase in overland traffic, there has been a rise in the number of road accidents. As Libyans have had to take to the roads linking the major cities in the country, hundreds have been involved in accidents in which they have been killed or suffered permanent disability. There have been some 15,260 victims of road accidents, including 2,560 fatalities. The remaining 12,700 victims are suffering from serious injuries or permanent disabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 18,200 public and privately owned vehicles have been damaged, for an estimated cost of $1,450,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The number of diabetics who have died has increased, owing to the unavailability of serums and medicines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The shortage of poliomyelitis vaccine, which continues to worsen, has impeded the implementation of periodic or annual therapeutic, preventive and awareness-raising programmes connected with national and international immunization campaigns with specific timetables. Many Libyan and other children have thus been prevented from receiving doses at the prescribed times in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) and national public health laws and regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Therapeutic and preventive services for school health programmes have been suspended, as have the programmes and activities of mother-and-child health-care centres and centres for the mentally retarded and physically handicapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. International pharmaceutical companies have been slow in supplying the health and social welfare sector and hospital establishments with essential pharmaceuticals and equipment needed to treat and prevent diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Companies specializing in the maintenance of air ambulances have refused to supply the spare parts needed to maintain the country's fleet and other on- board equipment. These aircraft, which service Libyan citizens and expatriates alike, are no longer able to perform fully their humanitarian mission, whether in Libya or abroad, given the country's extensive land area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Delays have consistently occurred in the delivery of some medical supplies (serums, vaccines, blood products, hormones, reagents used in AIDS testing, radioactive iodine, etc.) because they are now shipped overland or by sea. Such supplies are usually shipped by air (so that the normal measures can be taken to preserve their efficacy); special permission must now be sought for the purchase of such items. When they arrive in Libya, most of these supplies (in particular, poliomyelitis vaccine) have lost their efficacy (having been stored under improper conditions) which has resulted in an increase in the number of deaths among infants and women, particularly in childbirth, and disarray in the provision of health services generally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Losses estimated at around $180,800,000 have been experienced in the health and social welfare sector owing to the maintenance of the aerial embargo against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, which has caused delays in the shipment of medical supplies. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya obtains supplies from specialized international companies to meet the needs of a variety of institutions (medical schools, technical institutes, rehabilitation centres and homes for the elderly).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Maintenance of the aerial embargo has dealt a serious blow to preventive and curative health services provided under international technical cooperation agreements. The country is endeavouring to develop, strengthen and maintain such agreements with various countries in order to develop the health and social welfare sector and modernize its hospitals with the aim of providing improved medical, therapeutic and prophylactic services for all its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. The maintenance of the embargo has also impeded cooperation programmes between the People's Committee for Health and Social Welfare and the bodies under it, on the one hand, and WHO, on the other. Most of the visits which international experts and WHO teams were to make to Libya have been cancelled or postponed, which has adversely affected all the major health care and preventive health programmes and hampered efforts to promote and modernize the health and social welfare sector. The failure or stagnation of international cooperation in this area would prevent Libya from achieving the targets set by WHO and pursuing the WHO strategy of &quot;Health for All by the Year 2000&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. More than 360 medical specialists and highly qualified instructors from universities and medical centres from around the world have been unable to come to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to treat patients with serious conditions, perform delicate surgical procedures in public hospitals, conduct examinations in the country's medical schools at different times of the year, and participate in conferences, symposia and courses organized in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. The growing shortage of spare parts has resulted in a deterioration in the maintenance of modern medical equipment used in hospitals and medical centres. In addition, there is the lack of technical skills in most hospitals and health establishments in major cities and villages alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. More than 8,500 medical doctors of various nationalities have been unable to come to the country to work in the health and social welfare sector because of the difficulties and hardships presented by the maintenance of the aerial embargo. Some 6,400 medical specialists in various fields have not renewed their contracts, which has adversely affected the quality of health care in the majority of hospitals and other health facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. AGRICULTURE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 15 April 1992, the implementation of the sanctions under Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) has inflicted serious damage and caused major financial losses in the agriculture and animal husbandry sector. These have affected all companies and institutions in the sector, as well as related development programmes. Agricultural output and meat production have fallen off markedly, resulting in financial losses estimated at $5,982,249,782...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transport and communications sector has suffered severely since the coercive sanctions were first imposed on Libya on 15 April 1992. Not only has this sector sustained heavy material damage and financial losses, but there have been moral and psychological aspects as well, which have adversely affected the capabilities, aspirations and morale of all transport and communication workers. Financial losses are estimated at $1,157,523,500...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. INDUSTRY AND MINING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the mandatory sanctions under Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) were first imposed, the industry and mining sector has continued to suffer considerable losses and other material damages. The total financial loss resulting from these increasingly adverse effects on all aspects of industrial development amounts to approximately $4,150,677,942, which can largely be ascribed to the following: (...)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. FINANCE AND TRADE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like all the other vital sectors, the finance and trade sector has suffered on account of the air embargo imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya by Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993). The total financial losses in the sector are currently estimated at $4,257,000,000, primarily owing to the following: (...)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V. ENERGY (PETROLEUM AND ELECTRICITY)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The energy sector (petroleum and electricity) has suffered considerable material losses as a result of the mandatory sanctions applied pursuant to Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993), and negative repercussions have been felt in most of the vital facilities and economic entities of that sector. The financial losses suffered by the sector are in the order of $3 billion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The following statement is from a &quot;bosberaad&quot; of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission which finished meeting yesterday. It was designed primarily for staff but is being released in the same form or the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioners, Committee members and the senior management of the Commission yesterday ended a two-day bosberaad during which they undertook a thorough review of its activities, including an analysis of our strengths and weaknesses, and drew up proposals for the way ahead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among areas which were identified for consideration and action were:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Re-modelling our hearings schedule to provide for a wider variety of hearings;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Enhancing the quality and quantity of statement-taking, on the basis that the making of statements will be the means by which we will reach most victims;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Ensuring that findings on human rights abuses begin to be made;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Improving the administrative capacity of the Amnesty Committee;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Finalising the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee's proposals for urgent interim relief for those victims of human rights abuses who need immediate assistance;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Conveying to the public that it will be Parliament, not the Commission, which decides finally on the nature and extent of reparations and mechanisms of rehabilitation for other victims;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Enhancing the Commission's capacity for seeking the truth, specifically in identifying perpetrators of human rights abuses;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Concrete strategies to promote reconciliation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Communication and interaction with the public;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Improving the information flow in the Commission; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Issues of management and team-building, including factors which affect the Commission's public image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposals to address these and other issues will be finalised by a strategic planning committee and the full Commission, operating in conjunction with management and staff of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key factor in planning the Commission's activities is the financial resources available to it. The Commission, in order to maintain and even step up its activities, is expecting the State to allocate adequate resources to facilitate the achievement of national unity and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Treasury Committee has indicated to us that it believes our budget has to be cut in line with national priorities and other cuts in State spending. This proposal challenges the Commission anew to exercise strict fiscal discipline and to streamline our operations to achieve the strategic objectives identified during the bosberaad at the lowest possible cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the Commission is determined that its independence from the political process needs to be firmly defended and it will work to ensure that the national objective of promoting unity and reconciliation in South Africa is given proper recognition in financial decision-making. These issues will be taken further by the Commission and discussed fully with staff and management.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Following is the Burundi Humanitarian Situation Report for the period September 10 to September 17 from the office of the Humanitarian Coordinator of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - Bujumbura remained calm following the assassination of the archbishop and President Buyoya's moves to restore political institutions.  However, fighting continued in the hills outside the city and in northern Burundi. Diminished fuel stocks and limited supplies of other essential resources continue to limit humanitarian activities, although specific exemptions granted by the Regional Sanctions Coordination Committee (RSCC) should provide some improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Unknown assailants assassinated the Roman Catholic archbishop of Burundi, Joachim Ruhuna, after ambushing his vehicle on September 9 in the parish of Gitongo, 37 km north of Gitega.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack was another significant blow against those arguing for a negotiated settlement to Burundi's on-going civil war. UN and NGO representatives in the country fear that the assassination of the archbishop will further divide the country, isolating moderates arguing for restraint on both sides of the ongoing conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of the six people who were travelling with the cleric have been found alive, while the body of a fifth was buried in Gitega on Sept. 11. The archbishop's body, and that of a nun who was travelling with him, have yet to be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither the military nor Hutu rebels have taken responsibility for the attack, while both sides have blamed the other for the ambush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archbishop's diocese of Gitega is the second biggest in the country and has recently been the scene of the some of the heaviest fighting in Burundi.  On July 23, the archbishop celebrated a requiem mass close to Bugendana for some 330 Tutsis massacred in the area, criticizing extremists of both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 10 Roman Catholic clerics have been assassinated in Burundi since 1993 and the archbishop himself survived an assassination attempt last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public church service will be held for the archbishop in Bujumbura on September 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN officials have welcomed the decision by the RSCC to exempt certain classes of relief items from the sanctions on Burundi. However, strict sanctions remain on the importation of other essential humanitarian goods.  Humanitarian agencies will now be able to import emergency medical and laboratory supplies, and nutritional supplements for infants and hospital patients. The UN will also be to import limited quantities of fuel for distributing these items. However, other essential humanitarian goods will still not be allowed in. The UN continues to seek exemptions for food and other items such as blankets, plastic sheeting, and supplies for water purification and sanitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In a move which Burundian government authorities hope will persuade neighboring countries to lift the economic embargo, President Pierre Buyoya pledged to restore the country's national assembly and once again allow limited activities of political parties. &quot;We have done our duty. We wait for others to do their duty,&quot; Buyoya said. &quot;I believe there should be no other pretexts (for sustaining the sanctions).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali termed Buyoya's Sept. 12 announcement &quot;extremely positive,&quot; political leaders from neighboring countries have made it clear their view that the announcement does not go far enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who spear-headed the imposition of sanctions, has said that the sanctions could be eased if there was evidence of serious talks with the rebels. He described the restoration of political institutions as being of lesser importance. Buyoya has offered to hold peace talks, but only if rebel movements first lay down their arms and &quot;renounce their ideology of genocide.&quot; Moreover, the constitution remains suspended, no new legislative elections will be held and it is unclear how the national assembly could operate since many of the Frodebu delegates elected three years ago have since fled the country and are now calling on party activists to join the armed rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued from Tanzania, Frodebu leader Jean Minani denounced the Buyoya move as a &quot;totally unacceptable masquerade.&quot; But 12 other Frodebu members declared their allegiance to the Buyoya government, setting themselves apart from those who have called for armed insurrection. The mainly Hutu Frodebu party won 65 of the 81 parliamentary seats in the 1993 legislative elections, while the Tutsi dominated Uprona party won the remaining 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some observers, including Uprona head Charles Mukasi think it is unlikely that the contending Frodebu factions could work together effectively in parliament and doubt the viability of a re-instituted national assembly.  Mukasi added that the measures taken by Buyoya will be &quot;useless and dangerous&quot; unless the sanctions are lifted and warned that Buyoya risked losing his credibility if they were not. Uprona's withdrawal of support for the Ntibantunganya government was one of the factors which precipitated the July coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former head of state Jean-Babtiste Bagaza, who has influence over sections of the army and Tutsi youth, has also called the plan unworkable. &quot;You can't govern a country in this fashion...Buyoya and his group must go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the CNDD, which might have been expected to be more skeptical, has been more supportive. In a statement issued from Brussels, the organization called the move &quot;a positive step but insufficient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Burundian Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama denied accusations by the Zairian government that his country was being used as a base for Rwandan Tutsis currently battling the Zairian army in the hills surrounding Uvira.  However, he warned that the fighting could engulf the entire region and called for meetings between the three countries to resolve the conflict. Over the past ten days, the Zairian army has been conducting a sweep against armed Tutsis near Uvira. The Zairian government on September 13 accused the Rwandan government of enrolling some 3,000 Zairian Tutsis and training them to destablize eastern Zaire with Burundi providing rear bases. Although the number of casualties is unknown, several hundred people have fled the region and are now reportedly living as refugees in Cibitoke province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days after the ambush of the archbishop, the Burundian military claims to have killed seven Hutu rebels on an attack on a bus. A military spokesman claims the attack was carried out by the same band who ambushed the cleric and that the attack was at the same approximate location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hutu rebels killed 15 people Sept. 13 in an attack on a displaced camp in Bubanza province. A military spokesman said that seven civilians, six rebels and a soldier were killed in the raid on Gara camp. In a separate attack, Hutu rebels ambushed two vehicles on the main RN1 highway near Bugarama, 35 kilometers east of Bujumbura, killing one civilian and wounding another.  Numerous trucks and minibuses have also reportedly been attacked along the same road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security in Bujumbura has returned to normal after rebels lobbed three mortars into the city's suburbs September 3. Three soldiers and over 100 rebels were killed in subsequent heavy fighting that lasted for over a week in the hills surrounding the city, military sources say. Over 1,700 displaced people temporarily moved to the Johnson Center and other sites around Bujumbura to escape the fighting. Many of them have since returned to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebels destroyed two more electrical pylons in Bubanza September 11.  Roughly 20 pylons have been destroyed since April, leaving Bujumbura virtually without electricity for the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-personnel mines are increasingly being used in the provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke. At least eight mine casualties have recently been treated in Bujumbura hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Affected Populations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following rebel offensives in Kayanza and Ngozi provinces, UNICEF, CRS and DHA conducted a joint mission to the region Sept. 11-12 in order to assess the needs of the affected populations. The mission visited several IDP sites and reported that humanitarian needs were largely being met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial authorities told the mission that at least 15,000 people had been displaced by the fighting but that they expected many IDPs to return to their homes shortly since security appeared to be improving. Humanitarian agencies in the north provided a quick and coordinated response to the emergency. WFP has provided 15 days of food rations and continues to operate Food for Work programs. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Christian Aid have provided blankets, jerry cans and soap, while MSF-Holland, MSF-Belgium and UNICEF are covering medical needs. UNICEF reports that it has provided 5mt of high energy biscuits to the population. UN agencies and NGOs operating in the area report that humanitarian activities have been limited by a shortage of fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRS reports that it provided food for approximately 2,360 people in Gitega over the reporting period as well as to approximately 1,000 IDPs and other vulnerable people in Bujumbura Rural. Some of those receiving distributions from CRS in the outskirts of the city were displaced by recent fighting in the area. Oxfam-UK and Christian Aid distributed blankets and other non-food items to individuals in the Kamenge area of the city displaced by recent fighting in the surrounding hills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Coordination of Humanitarian Activities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the critical fuel shortages, UN agencies have created a joint logistics service to combine deliveries of existing supplies. WFP and UNHCR will, whenever possible, attempt to deliver humanitarian supplies for other UN agencies and NGOs. WFP will coordinate requests from NGOs to transport food and nutritional supplements, UNICEF will handle NGO requests for the transport of non-food items and WHO will handle NGO requests for medical supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the RSCC's decision to allow UN agencies to import fuel for specified humanitarian activities, the UN system has agreed that WFP will be the sole importer of fuel products. Relying on a single importer, rather than each agency importing its own needs, will simplify reporting and verification requirements. A committee composed of representatives of UN agencies will oversee the distribution of the fuel to ensure that humanitarian agencies use it in strict accordance with the letter and spirit of the exemption.  ActionAid will coordinate fuel requests from recognized NGOs and forward those requests to the UN committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work on the Joint Operations Plan for Humanitarian Intervention in Burundi continues. Sectoral drafting responsibilities have been distributed among UN agencies and September 30 has been set as a target date for final completion of the document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAO, in conjunction with WFP, hosted a meeting Sept. 16 with UN agencies and NGOs to discuss the effects of the embargo on the agricultural sector. An FAO emergency survey on seeds, fertilizer and insecticide needs is continuing with an FAO assessment mission visiting the provinces of Bururi, Rutana, Makamba, Gitega and Muramvya over the reporting period. FAO, in conjunction with its NGO partners Dorkas Aid and CRS, conducted a mission to Rutana to discuss planned seed multiplication programs with local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Impact of Sanctions on the Delivery of Humanitarian Assistance Sanctions continue to take their toll on the delivery of humanitarian goods.  Fuel shortages have been compounded by the lack of electricity in the capital.  This has forced all humanitarian agencies to divert a significant portion of their fuel supply to run office generators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the lack of fuel, for example, UNICEF deliveries of clean water to IDPs were limited to 21m3 of water for 4,500 persons in two camps. Under normal circumstances, deliveries of clean water consist of 100m3 for over 8, 500 IDPs. UNICEF has also been forced to halt field visits planned for the delivery of materials and the monitoring of work being carried out on the rehabilitation of gravity flow water systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAO reports that if seeds and other agricultural inputs required for the upcoming planting season are not allowed into the country, there will be an over 40 percent decrease in the production of basic, non-export food crops.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is a report to Congress on Angola sent by President Clinton to the U.S. Congress, pursuant to U.S. law, on September 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since March 25, 1996, concerning the national emergency with respect to Angola that was declared in Executive Order 12865 of September 26, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 26, 1993, I declared a national emergency with respect to Angola, invoking the authority, inter alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 (22 U.S.C. 287c).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 864, dated September 15, 1993, the order prohibited the sale or supply by United States persons or from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and petroleum and petroleum products to the territory of Angola other than through designated points of entry. The order also prohibited such sale or supply to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (&quot;UNITA&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States persons are prohibited from activities that promote or are calculated to promote such sales or supplies, or from attempted violations, or from evasion or avoidance or transactions that have the purpose of evasion or avoidance, of the stated prohibitions. The order authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, as might be necessary to carry out the purposes of the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On December 10, 1993, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions Regulations (the &quot; Regulations&quot;) (58 Fed. Reg. 64904) to implement the President's declaration of a national emergency and imposition of sanctions against Angola (UNITA).  There have been no amendments to the regulations since my report of March 25, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations prohibit the sale or supply by United States persons or from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and petroleum and petroleum products to UNITA or to the territory of Angola other than through designated points.  United States persons are also prohibited from activities that promote or are calculated to promote such sales or supplies to UNITA or Angola, or from any transaction by any United States persons that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions set forth in the Executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also prohibited are transactions by United States persons, or involving the use of U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, relating to transportation to Angola or UNITA of goods the exportation of which is prohibited. The government of Angola has designated the following points of entry as points in Angola to which the articles otherwise prohibited by the Regulations may be shipped: Airports: Luanda and Katumbela, Benguela Province; Ports: Luanda and Lobito, Benguela Province; and Namibe, Namibe Province; and Entry Points: Malongo, Cabinda Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although no specific license is required by the Department of the Treasury for shipments to these designated points of entry (unless the item is destined for UNITA), any such exports remain subject to the licensing requirements of the Departments of State and/or Commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The OFAC has worked closely with the U.S. financial community to assure a heightened awareness of the sanctions against UNITA -- through the dissemination of publications, seminars, and notices to electronic bulletin boards. This educational effort has resulted in frequent calls from banks to assure that they are not routing funds in violation of these prohibitions.  United States exporters have also been notified of the sanctions through a variety of media, including special fliers and computer bulletin board information initiated by OFAC and posted through the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Government Printing Office. There have been no license applications under the program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month period from March 26, 1996, through September 25, 1996, that are directly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to Angola (UNITA) are reported to be about $227,000, most of which represents wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Under Secretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel) and the Department of State (particularly the Office of Southern African Affairs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant developments, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Following is a statement issued by the Human Rights Committee of the Muslim Parliament regarding the detained Nigerian Muslim leader Ibrahim Al-Zakzaky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday 12th September 1996, Mu'allim Ibrahim Al-Zakzaky, the 43 year old Muslim leader of the Islamic movement in Nigeria, was arrested and taken from his home in Zaria City. Twenty three other people, including women were also arrested. All but four were released, and the others charged with miscellaneous, fabricated charges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day, saw a peaceful demonstration in Zaria City against the arrests. Police opened fire on the protesters, many of whom were women and children. 14 died, including Abu Bakr Rabi'u Galadimana a boy of only three years of age. On Wednesday 19th September, 3 people who were among thousands commemorating the deaths of the previous week, were shot dead by police in Kaduna City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mu'allim Ibrahim Al-Zakzaky has never called for violence, despite the violence he and his followers have suffered. His movement has always been peaceful in nature. His deputy Hamid Danlani, is the publisher of the Muslim journal Al-Mizan. After his arrest a printing machine, other printing materials and money were all confiscated from his home. Both he and Mu'allim Ibrahim have been charged with publishing without a licence. Given Nigeria's recent record on freedom of expression, there are grave concerns about the safety of Mu'allim Ibrahim and the others being held with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We call on the Nigerian junta to free Mu'allim Ibrahim and his colleagues.  Please write to the politicians, governments, organisations expressing your concern. Please forward this message to all muslims you know.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - The Panel of High-Level Personalities on African Development, meeting at United Nations Headquarters on 12 September, has recommended that debt, governance and human resource development should be priority areas for consideration at the current Mid-term Review of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. The Panel also highlighted the importance of trade facilitation and resource mobilization, food security and agriculture, as well as greater flexibility and coordination of development support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High-Level Panel was established in 1992 by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to advise and assist him in ensuring the effective implementation of the New Agenda and to foster Africa's development in general. The 12 September meeting was convened and chaired by the Secretary- General.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the meeting, Mr. Boutros-Ghali restated the United Nations commitment to African development and urged the Panel to consider its advocacy role with regard to enhancing Africa's image in the donor community and ensuring continued support. He asked the Panel to discuss the best ways of mobilizing African leaders to address critical development issues as well as how the resources of non-governmental organizations and the private sector in developed countries could best be harnessed in support of African development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While stressing the need to reverse the generally negative perception of Africa, the Panel felt that publicizing African success stories might not be enough. Panel members therefore identified several priority areas for consideration by the Mid-term Review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On debt, the Panel looked forward to a satisfactory outcome of current discussions on debt relief and, most importantly, to quick implementation. It urged that eligibility and other criteria for debt relief should be flexible enough to ensure that significant relief is provided to as many countries as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On governance, Panel members noted the great efforts under way in many countries in the areas of democratization and human rights. However, they urged substantial support to strengthen capacities in the public and private sectors as well as in civil society, for efficient management of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identifying human resource development as essential for Africa's economic recovery, the Panel said such efforts should not be subject to selectivity or conditionality. They should also receive proper attention during implementation of structural adjustment programmes. Without a healthy and well-trained population, Africa would not be able to benefit from globalization. Calling for more attention to be paid to the social sector, Panel members urged African countries to match public spending to their proclaimed commitment to human development, while donor countries were urged to increase their support in that critical area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade was another essential factor in Africa's economic growth development, the Panel stated. To better integrate African countries into the global economy, the international community should support trade facilitation schemes which involved commodity diversification programmes. It should also support efforts to develop supply capability and market access. The Panel urged African countries to mobilize domestic resources and enhance savings for investment and faster economic growth. It also emphasized the importance of an enabling environment for attracting foreign direct investment, which had so far eluded African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In several cases, rigidities in the support provided for African development had contributed to a reversal of progress, the Panel noted. It stressed the need for flexibility in applying pre-established performance benchmarks and welcomed the trend towards improved coordination between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. That should lead to more effective sectoral programmes which could receive financial support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Panel welcomed the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa and said the Mid-term Review should provide the opportunity to better articulate and also strengthen the links between the New Agenda and the Special Initiative, which was designed to strengthen United Nations support for African development. Through a focused effort, the Initiative could encourage the spread of &quot;best practices&quot; and also improve the efficiency of development implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emphasizing the importance of food security and agriculture, the Panel fully supported the objectives of the New Agenda and the Special Initiative in that area. The Panel decided to devote its next meeting to food security and agriculture, and also to revisit the issue of governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Panel's current membership includes the following high-level personalities: Sir Ketumile Masire, President of Botswana; Poul Nielson, Denmark's Minister for Development Cooperation; Baroness Lynda Chalker, Minister for Overseas Development of the United Kingdom; Ambassador Andrew Young, former United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations; Philippe Jurgensen, former Director-General of the Caisse francaise de developpement and current Director-General of the Societe francaise de garantie des financements des petites et moyennes entreprises; Mohammed Sadli, Adviser to the President of Indonesia for South-South and North-South Cooperation; R. Barthelt, Director-General for Sub-Saharan Africa in Germany's Ministry for Foreign Affairs; Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU); Graca Machel, Mozambique's former First Lady and current President of the Foundation for Community Development; Ambassador Yasushi Kurokochi of Japan, who served as Chairman of the Tokyo International Conference on Aid and Development; K.Y. Amoako, Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA); Rubens Ricupero, Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD); and Hazem El-Beblawi, Executive Secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - An unprecedented coalition of U.S. and international organizations today condemned the recent court-ordered divorce of Cairo University Professor Nasr Hamed Abu Zeid from his wife, Professor Ibtihal Yunis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizations--which include the National Association of Arab Americans, the Arab-American University Graduates, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, the Arab American Institute and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee--declared that the decision by Egypt's highest court &quot;is in flagrant violation of one of the most cherished of human rights -- the right of a legally married couple to remain married so long as both parties so desire -- as well as the basic right of free expression, including academic freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coalition calls on President Husni Mubarak to speak out publicly for the rights of Dr. Abu Zeid and Dr.Yunis, and to support the application by Dr.  Abu Zeid's lawyers to the Court of Cassation to nullify the ruling which is due to be heard on September 25. The organizations also urge the government of Egypt to initiate legislation that would protect the basic rights of Egyptians from gross violations by courts in cases such as this one. &quot;By upholding the right of a civil court to declare an Egyptian citizen an apostate,&quot; the coalition asserts, &quot;the ruling has a severe chilling effect on freedom of expression and emboldens forces of intolerance.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The text of the statement and the list of signatory organizations is attached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COALITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, ARAB-AMERICAN, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, AND ACADEMIC ORGANIZATIONS CONDEMNS EGYPTIAN COURT DECISION DISSOLVING A PROFESSOR'S MARRIAGE BECAUSE OF HIS WRITINGS ON ISLAM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undersigned organizations wish to condemn, in the strongest terms, the recent ruling by the Court of Cassation, Egypt's highest court, to uphold a lower civil court decision declaring Cairo University Professor Nasr Hamed Abu Zeid an apostate and ordering that he and his wife, Professor Ibtihal Yunis, be legally compelled to separate against their will. This decision is in flagrant violation of one of the most cherished of human rights -- the right of a legally married couple to remain married so long as both parties so desire -- as well as the basic right of free expression, including academic freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undersigned organizations--comprising human rights, Arab-American, women's rights, academic and other organizations--call on President Husni Mubarak to speak out publicly for the basic rights of Dr. Abu Zeid and Dr.  Yunis that have been compromised, and to initiate legislation that would protect these rights from gross violations by courts in the future. By tolerating this silencing and the forcible breakup of a family on the purported basis of Islamic law, the government of Egypt undermines its quest for international as well as local support in its struggle against forces of politico-religious extremism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 5, the Court of Cassation upheld the legality of a Cairo Appeals Court ruling in favor of an Islamist lawyer who had demanded that Abu Zeid's marriage with Dr. Yunis be nullified. The Appeals Court supported the plaintiff's contention that Professor Abu Zeid was an apostate and therefore ineligible, under religious law (shari'a), to be married to a Muslim woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basis for the legal action against Abu Zeid are his scholarly writings and teaching. A professor in the Arabic department of the University of Cairo specializing in Quranic studies, he applied modern tools of linguistics and discourse analysis to the Quran and other early Islamic texts, and particularly to the subsequent interpretations (ijtihad) of these texts in commentaries by Islamic scholars in different periods. In ruling against Dr.  Abu Zeid, the Appeals Court, a civil court, concluded that he had &quot;refused to acquiesce to God's legislation, claiming that it is related to a specific historical period, and asking that the mind begin to exchange them with contemporary meanings that are more humane and progressive, better than the literal meanings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 1995, in promoting Dr. Abu Zeid to full professor, the Cairo University Council observed that &quot;If there is something urgent about his style, it stems from the urgency of the crisis which the contemporary Arab- Islamic World is witnessing... Academic research should not be isolated from social problems but should be allowed to participate in current debates and to suggest solutions to current problems by allowing researchers to investigate and interpret as far as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first ruling on the case, in January 1994, the Giza Personal Status Court dismissed the suit, declaring that the plaintiff did not have standing.  The Cairo Appeals Court reversed this ruling in June 1995, declared Abu Zeid an apostate, and ruled that the couple must separate. It is this ruling that the Court of Cassation has now upheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, recalling the 1992 assassination of the secularist intellectual Farag Foda, condemned the Court of Cassation ruling as &quot;a death sentence against Dr. Abu Zeid and his wife.&quot; Following the 1995 Appeals Court ruling, the militant Jihad Organization in fact called for the killing of Abu Zeid as an apostate. At that time Abu Zeid accepted an invitation to continue his work in the Netherlands, where he and his wife presently reside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Cassation decision also grossly violates the rights of Dr.  Yunis, a professor of French literature at Cairo University. With the court- ordered separation, she stands to lose her right to inherit from her husband and to gain custody of any children if they were to have any. She could also face dismissal from her university job: since she is no longer legally married, the reason for her professional leave -- to accompany her husband while abroad -- is removed. The decision also implicitly calls their union adulterous. And it highlights the effectively discriminatory nature of Egypt's code of personal status. If the spouse who was declared apostate were the wife, divorce would not have the same practical consequence of severely compromising the husband's civil and professional standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the first case in which Egypt's judiciary has ordered the divorce of a couple, on the basis of one's thoughts or writings, where both spouses wish to remain united. This ruling violates several international treaties that Egypt has ratified. These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states in Article 18, &quot;...everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion...no one shall be subject to coercion which should impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.&quot; It also violates Article 23, which states, &quot;The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State,&quot; and, &quot;The right of men and women of marriageable age to marry and to found a family shall be recognized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By disregarding Dr. Yunis's desire to uphold her marriage contract and her confidence in the compatibility of her religious beliefs with those of her husband, the court's ruling places Egypt in violation of its obligations as a State Party to the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. That Convention requires that women be accorded full equality in rights. Article 15.1 requires parties to accord to women equality with men before the law and Article 15.2 provides: &quot;States Parties shall accord to women, in civil matters, a legal capacity identical to that of men and the same opportunities to exercise that capacity. In particular, they shall give women equal rights to conclude contracts...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent, Cairo-based Center for Human Rights Legal Aid points out that the Court of Cassation has previously declared that principles of international law are considered an integral part of national legislation, and that an Egyptian judge is bound to these principles wherever national legislation does not address the issue in question. Since apostasy is not addressed in national legislation, the principles of international law should have been applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ruling against Abu Zeid, Egypt's highest court affirmed the controversial hisba doctrine, which grants third parties standing in court to initiate cases against defendants whom they accuse of having violated religious law. However, on May 22, 1996 the Egyptian National Assembly, with the support of the Mubarak government, passed a law denying such third parties standing before the court as a matter of public policy. The law explicitly applies to all court cases pending anywhere in Egypt at the time of its adoption. The Court of Cassation nonetheless refused to consider and apply this law to the Abu Zeid case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups signing this statement fear that this decision, if allowed to stand, sets an ominous precedent. By upholding the right of a civil court to declare an Egyptian citizen an apostate, the ruling imperils Egypt's dynamic civil society. Specifically, the ruling has a severe chilling effect on freedom of expression and the lively exchange of ideas, and emboldens forces of intolerance which have no respect for internationally recognized human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While wishing to respect the constitutional separation of the executive and judicial branches of the Egyptian government, the undersigned organizations urge President Mubarak to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Examine all legal options to prevent the implementation of the court's decision in the Abu Zeid case, including: (a) support for an application made to the competent court for a stay of execution of the court decision dissolving the Abu Zeid marriage; and (b) support for the application made to the Court of Cassation for an extraordinary judgment to nullify the ruling against Abu Zeid on the basis of gross error and bad faith in the application of the law. (Such a case, known as a mokhasama, is heard before seven of the Court of Cassation judges. If they accept the claim on the technical side, it then goes to a court consisting of all members of the Cassation Court. If they accept it, then the case is sent back for a retrial before another circuit of the Court of Cassation.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draft new legislation to strengthen guarantees of freedom of expression and academic research, in accordance with Article 49 of the Egyptian Constitution and with Egypt's obligations to respect international human rights covenants, as well as legislation to bring Egypt into full compliance with regard to rights guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Express public support for the right of Professor Abu Zeid to exercise his right to expression free from all forms of harassment, as well as for the right of he and Dr. Yunis to remain married. If need be, provide the couple with adequate security should they request it if and when they return to Egypt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South Africa has no immediate intention of seeking financial assistance from either the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, the country's finance minister, Trevor Manuel, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that South Africa's success in the international bond market, despite the sharp fall in the rand showed that the country was capable of standing on its own two feet in economic terms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not as though we are knocking on the door of the Fund or the Bank with a begging bowl,&quot; he told a media conference here Monday ahead of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings which are scheduled to begin in Washington D.C.  later this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel said South Africa would be attending the constituency meetings of the IMF and the World Bank as part of the Africa Group, and would not be making an independent statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Group, he added, would be presenting joint statements on such issues as relief proposals for heavily indebted countries, and ways of increasing private capital outflow to developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa, as part of the African constituency, will participate fully in this process,&quot; said Manuel, &quot;and supports a coordinated regional approach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country, he added, &quot;believes that more developing countries should be granted debt relief, and that investment initiatives should be mainly targeted at these countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - There are signs that sales of Zimbabwe's premier flue- cured tobacco crop are tailing off with little tobacco being delivered to the auction floors as farmers start preparing for the new season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) President Robert Webb said up to Monday a total of 192 million kg had been sold, a marginal increase from the 180.5 million kg (2.205 kg = 1 pound) sold up two weeks ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are signs that volumes are beginning to tail off and we are now putting our seasonal sales at just on the 200 million kg mark, down from the initial estimate of between 202 and 203 million,&quot; Webb said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the market as bullish, Webb said last week's average price was 29.80 zimdollars (2.98 US dollars) per kg, a shed up from 29.70 zimdollars (2.  97 dollars) attained two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prices for quality tobacco in particular still remains strong,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prices have firmed over the past six months as a result of reports of damage to the crop in the United States and China, the other major tobacco producers in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both countries have had exceptionally wet years, with the U.S. experiencing freak storms and China suffering from typhoon, exerting pressure on the world stock. Last deliveries are expected Sept. 27, raising fears that the season might end prematurely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flue-cured tobacco is this year expected to earn the country 7 billion zimdollars (700 million dollars), making it the single largest foreign currency earner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In speeches to mark the opening of the Zimbabwe-Hamburg trade and investment conference, the Germans said there were indications the continent was on the path to economic and political stability and deserved attention from German investors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world is full of African pessimism, but we know of another Africa of progress,&quot; said Nikolaus Schues, president of the Hamburg chamber of commerce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the World Bank projected average economic growth rate of 4 percent in Africa and of Zimbabwe's recovery from a decline in GDP of 3 percent in 1995 to 7 percent in 1996 as signs of African progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor of Hamburg, Henning Voscheran, noted that life expectancy on the continent had improved by 28 percent and that democratic elections were now a common feature. He noted that these were signs of change in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - At least 18 people have been killed and 26 injured in ethnic clashes in the Stilfontein area of South Africa's North- West province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First reports said that at least 10 people died in an attack Sunday in which no fewer than eight explosions ripped through dwellings at a mine contract workers' settlement in the area, and victims fleeing the chaos were caught and either shot or stabbed to death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 18 people were wounded in the attack, which is understood to have been a direct result of tensions between the Xhosa and Sotho ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police found and defused four more devices made from commercial explosives of the type used on the mines in the area. Senior police officials voiced fear of further violence in the area in the form of reprisal attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early Monday police fears became reality when further violence erupted in the Stilfontein area, resulting in eight more people being killed and another eight injured -- some seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest reports indicated that, with police maintaining a strong presence with regular patrols moving through the area, there is an uneasy calm. The mine shafts at the nearby Hartebeesfontein and Buffelsfontein gold mines are operating normally and all is quiet at the mine hostels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special investigating team has been appointed to consider a range of charges from murder and attempted murder to public violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 2,000 contract miners and their families are believed to live in the mine settlement complex in the Stilfontein area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - France has become the first non-African country to ratify the Pelindaba Treaty making Africa a nuclear weapons free zone, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ratifying three protocols, which are annexed to the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty, &quot;France has undertaken not to use or threaten to use a nuclear explosive device against any party to the treaty or in any part of the nuclear-weapon free zone,&quot; the organization, Africa's foremost political body, said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France has also agreed &quot;not to test or encourage the research, testing of any nuclear explosive device or the stationing of such devices anywhere within the African Nuclear-Weapon Free Zone.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French Ambassador to Ethiopia, Louis Amigues, deposited the instruments of ratification at a ceremony Friday at the headquarters of the continental organization in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, he said, attached great importance to the objectives of the treaty.  &quot;That is why France ratified the treaty so quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, France remains the only non-African nation to have carried out nuclear weapons tests on the continent. It did so between 1960 and 1966 from its Reggane base in the Sahara desert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this period, it carried out four aerial tests and 13 underground explosions at In Ecker. It tested its first atomic bomb February 13, 1960, in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until 1996, France was at the center of controversy over its test in the Pacific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But OAU Assistant Secretary-General Ahmed Haggag said that the Pelindaba treaty was a demonstration of Africa's determination to make the continent free of nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, the only African country to have tested nuclear weapons -- during the apartheid era -- has stopped all such activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pelindaba treaty is for signature and ratification by 53 OAU member states, of which 48 have signed so far. Mauritius, Haggag said, was the only member state that had ratified the treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treaty's text and the protocols annexed to it were drawn up under the auspices of the OAU in Pelindaba, South Africa, in December 1994. The treaty itself was signed April 11, 1996 in Cairo, Egypt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique - The Mozambican government on Monday signed an agreement with British Petroleum (BP), for oil exploration covering an offshore area of about 80,000 square kilometers (30,888 square miles) in the delta of the Zambezi river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement was signed by the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, John Kachamila, the General Manager of the National Hydrocarbons Company (ENH) , Issufo Abdullah, and the BP General Manager for West Africa, David Bamford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement covers six months of initial surveys.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A previous prospection in the Zambezi Delta, undertaken by the Norwegian company, GECO, in the 1980s, did not yield good results. However, GECO focused effort on the shallow water zones, while BP is concentrating on areas where the water is up to 2,000 meters deep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If, as Bamford expects, the initial results are positive, further, and more extensive surveys, relying largely on seismic methods, will be carried out over the next two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If results continue to be positive, we would then shoot 3D seismic data, and maybe sink some wells&quot;, he added. According to Kachamila there is now &quot; great interest&quot; internationally in Mozambique's oil and natural gas potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to BP, two other foreign companies are negotiating oil prospection contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdullah told the Mozambican News Agency (AIM) that a U.S.-based company, ARCO, was interested in natural gas known to exist at Temane, in the southern province of Inhambane, and in prospecting for oil off the coast of the central province of Sofala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a Canadian firm, CANOP, is negotiating onshore oil prospection rights in the Limpopo Basin in the south of the country, where the results of aerial geophysical surveys are said to be highly encouraging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negotiations follow deals signed earlier in 1996 with U.K.-based multinational, Lonrho, for oil prospection in the Rovuma Basin in the far north, and with concerns from Canada and the United Arab Emirates for exploiting the gas reserves at Buzi in Sofala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 1995, giant U.S.-based corporation, ENRON, signed an agreement for the exploitation of the largest known natural gas reserves in Mozambique, located at Pande in Inhambane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kachamila, one South African company is interested in purchasing the gas to feed an iron ore bonification plant. Final results of ongoing feasibility studies on the reserves are expected in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, a small amount of the Pande gas is being exploited for electricity generation in the nearby town of Vilanculo. But major exploitation can only start once a gas pipeline to South Africa is built, and that in turn depends on a firm contract with the South African end-user of the gas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katete - Thirty-seven (37) Zairean illegal immigrants who were stranded in Mozambique a week ago after they resisted to be deported have at last been accepted by Zambia which will now facilitate their eventual repatriation back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean nationals, who included men and women, were stranded at Nsadzu in Mozambique, 57 kilometres South of the Zambian administrative town of Katete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration spokesperson, Catherine Poso, confirmed the latest development in Lusaka today and added that all 37 persons were handed over to the Zambian government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Poso said after the hand over the illegal immigrants were detained at Katete Prison while awaiting the Ministry of Home Affairs to mobilise vehicles which will take them finally to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Zambian Police and Immigration officials had refused to accept the illegal immigrants because it was not quite clear how they entered Mozambique arguing that they did not cross Zambia before entering that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and Immigration were also initially divided on how to treat the illegal immigrants with some officers arguing that once deported from Mozambique the people could not be regarded as prohibited immigrants in Zambia where they had committed no offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another argument was that though they had been declared illegal immigrants by Mozambique the men and women had failed to produce documents which allowed them to stay legally in Zambia meaning that even in this country too they were not welcome and could not claim to be legitimate visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In view of this it was found necessary to keep them in detention until transport was found to ferry them to Kasumbalesa on the Copperbelt from where they could be handed over Zairean uathorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detainees were arrested in Mozambique's Tete province on September 4 this year for entering the country illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were brought to Nsadzu on September 19 after the Zambian government finally agreed to take them in for their subsquent repatriation to Zaire through Kasumbalesa in Chililabombwe because they did not pass through its territoy when going to Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the detainees claimed that they had refused leave Mozambique for Zaire until security officers fired in the air several times to force them out of Nsadzu when they tried to challenge their deportation to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Poso would not say when the final movement might take place for the Zaireans.  Source: ZAMTODAY</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - For the re-opening of primary schools on Monday 23 September 1996, UNICEF, in collaboration with the Government of Burundi and the National Radio and Television Service has launched a campaign to raise primary school enrollment rates which have fallen 15% over the last 3 years to only 35% .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the beginning of the crisis in October 1993, UNICEF has strongly supported the Government of Burundi's efforts to ensure maximum school enrollment of the country's children. UNICEF played a key role in the re- opening of schools closed following the events of October 1993 and since that time has provided financial and technical support to the Ministry of Education to improve infrastructures, equipment and personnel in the education sector.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, UNICEF provided financial support for:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the production of school textbooks to replaced those destroyed over the past 3 years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* training for over 3,000 underqualified teachers to replace those who left the country, were internally displaced or killed * logistical support to the Ministry through the provision of 3 vehicles, 20 motorbikes, 336 bicycles, 400 radios and 476 library kits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* improving radio distance education programmes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* strengthening administration of the sector</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* updating curricula o improving in-class teaching methods</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this year's re-opening of schools, UNICEF has provided large quantities of school materials which will be distributed by the Ministry of Education and by NGOs. To address the needs of the most vulnerable victims of the crisis, UNICEF has provided school materials and health insurance cards to non-accompanied children who wish to attend school. In upholding Article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , UNICEF, the Government of Burundi and several local and international NGOs have developed the &quot;Let's Build Peace&quot; project which in 1994 and 1995 has reached over 200,000 children in grades 4 and 5, and more than 3,000 teachers, school directors and inspectors. A teachers' manual is currently being prepared to extend peace education to include grades 2 and 3 this year. To provide internally displaced and dispered children access to schools in regions where few exist, UNICEF has undertaken the construction of temporary classrooms. To date, twelve such classrooms have been erected to serve over 1,200 displaced children in Gatumba outside of Bujumbura. Additional temporary classrooms are planned for other sites in and around Bujumbura and for displaced children in Muyinga Province. To meet the psycho-social needs of children traumatized by the crisis, UNICEF has prepared a games and activity book to address the special needs of these children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF thanks all donors whose assistance has made possible these efforts to support education in Burundi, including the European Union through ECHO, the Governments of Italy, Norway, Sweden, Canada, the United States, as well as UNICEF National Committees in Belgium, the UK and Australia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia National Union of Farmers is disappointed with the role of the National Food Reserve Agency in the purchase of maize from farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to ZNFU Executive Director George Gray in an interview yesterday, the agency has not purchased any maize from the farmers since it was set up in April this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the best of my knowledge the agency received money this year for the purchase of grain bags but there has been no maize purchased from farmers. We would have expected the agency to participate in the maize market in May, June and July. It would have steadied the market and helped support the maize price,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray explained that non-participation of the Food Reserve Agency was especially bad for the small scale farmer who had needed to sell his maize before the end of the marketing season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The small scale farmer needs to sell by October in order to get money for inputs for the following season,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He commended the private traders who had gone in to buying maize from farmers as they were able to pay cash to the farmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Food Reserve Agency, co-ordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture last week announced through its Weekly Market Bulletin that it had decided to purchase maize in 50kg polypropylene bags only, and will not accept the traditional 90kg jute bags used by most farmers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be meaningless unless the MMD government addresses the question of the electoral process and transitional arrangements should they fail to hold elections by October 31,&quot; ZDC deputy general secretary Azwell Banda said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And National Party secretary general, Akashambatwa-Mbikusita-Lewanika, said although it was too late for any legislation that can have an impact on improving the performance record of MMD, the government in the &quot;last lap&quot; should try and pay attention to consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing one can expect is some consequential law amendment to facilitate the holding of elections,&quot; Lewanika said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the issues to be tabled before the House is the controversial Electoral Amendment Act of 1996 which spells out the qualifications of a presidential candidate and the autonomy of the Electoral Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Liberal Progressive Front chairman, Roger Chongwe, appealed to members of parliament not to allow the Bill to pass because it defeats the independence of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is going to allow President Chiluba to go to a chief or a priest and collect a letter saying he was born in that area and according to this Act this letter cannot be challenged in Court,&quot; Chongwe said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Most departments at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) were yesterday paralysed as paramedicals, radiographers, physiologists, laboratory technologists and clinic officers joined junior nurses in their strike which has now entered the fourth day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UTH junior nurses, who started the strike on Friday last week, yesterday rejected the call by Civil Servants Union of Zambia (CSUZ) secretary general Japhet Moonde to resume work after the hospital's board of management resolved some of the issues which they had raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have discussed all the issues which you have raised and we have done a lot to resolve them and therefore for the time being return to your work,&quot; Moonde pleaded with uncompromising nurses as they kept on interjecting him with slogans; &quot;No money, no work, it's poverty which has made us to go on strike&quot;, throughout his address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moonde told the nurses, who vowed not to end their strike until the &quot;salary and allowance increment issue&quot; was resolved that his union will not be held responsible if anything happened to them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let us not spoil our case, we have very good grievances but other issues like salaries and allowances can only be settled through negotiation with the government,&quot;Moonde said. &quot;I have made it clear, we have done a lot but we are not going to be held responsible to what will happen to you if you don't resume your work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Zambia Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) secretary general Alec Chirwa has appealed to the workers to resume work as the union and management try to resolve the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press statement released yesterday, Chirwa said that the resumption of work at UTH would facilitate a speedy solution to the current problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chirwa, however, urged management to take advantage of the good will by the workers to urgently find solutions to the workers grievances in order that normal operations could return to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UTH board of management acting executive director, Dr.Tuckson Lambert, in an attempt to bring sanity to his institution which has been rocked with spates of strike warned nurses to &quot;stay away&quot; from the hospital if they were not ready to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have heard what the union and management have agreed upon but if you are not going to work then stay at home,&quot; a visibly emotional Dr Lambert told nurses who were gathered at UTH main reception. &quot;We don't want to see you gathering at the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the address, nurses who were also demanding for an apology from health minister Katele Kalumba for calling them &quot;fools&quot; for the ongoing strike, determined but frustrated walked away from the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a UTH administrative officer who sought anonymity disclosed the solidarity strike by other junior medical personnel and a snap survey conducted by The Post around 14 00 hours showed that the main pharmacy, radiography and physiotherapy departments were closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can check for yourself, most of the departments have been temporarily closed because of lack of manpower,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UTH public relations officer, Don Mwape, who was a &quot;highly wanted man&quot; by the nurses for issuing a statement on Sunday that the strike had been called- off, also confirmed the operational difficulties at the country's biggest hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a few senior medical personnel who are manning the departments but generally the situation is bad,&quot; Mwape said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia National Union of Health and Allied Workers (ZNHAW) secretary general, Soda Kabwabwa, whose members include most junior medical personnel said it was unfair for employees to continue their strike when, &quot;dialogue between management and the union was progressively going on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UTH board of management, the ministry of health represented by health director Dr Ben Chirwa, CSUZ and ZNHAW, who were closed in a crisis meeting for almost four hours, agreed on the issues of zonal monthly bonus, high cost scheme, allocate a doctor to a staff clinic, to stop the transport fee, renovate the nurses' hostels, pay the employees travelling and subsistence allowance on commencement of leave and provide new uniforms by the end of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two parties also undertook to resolve issues of salaries, housing allowance, commuted overtime allowance and commuted night allowance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurses are demanding for a 100 per cent salary increase.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The proposed independent Electoral Commission should be adequately funded and no individual should have overriding powers on its operations, a group of prominent Zambians have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during last night's television programme Topic, MMD member and prominent lawyer Mundia Sikatana said that the electoral commission should be free of interference from the executive and that it should only be answerable to the judiciary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sikatana cautioned that unless the Electoral commission Bill is seriously debated and given more muscle in parliament before it becomes an Act, it will fail to live to people's expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zambia Independent Monitoring Team president Alfred Zulu said during the same programme that at the moment the President had overriding powers over the commission, an anomaly he said should be stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zulu said that the commission should determine its operations and must not be influenced by either the executive or the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Law Association of Zambia chairman Sakwiba Sikota deplored the current electoral commission for lacking powers to prevent an election from taking place where irregularities have been observed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Dialogue on the current political situation will not work as long as the MMD government remained in office, advised Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) vice-president, Austin Liato on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liato told delegates to a one day National Civic Orga-nisations Convention at Lusaka's Mulungushi Conference Centre on Saturday that no matter how much the political front, especially the constitutional impasse may be debated, it will still not achieve anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All issues on the constitutional impasse have fallen on deaf ears of the MMD government, and no matter how much it may be debated it will still achieve nothing because the government is not interested anymore,&quot; Liato said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And MMD national secretary, minister without portfolio Michael Sata, speaking on ZNB's Open Forum Sunday night that his government was interested in dialogue but only in so far as it did not touch on the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sata said the Constitution was now the law of the land and was therefore not subject to discussion any more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) secretary general, Derrick Chitala, told the same forum that even dialogue on other issues has so far been a waste of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the MMD government had agreed to have an independent Electoral Commission, Chitala said, it was not possible that this would be implemented in the short time left before the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government thought it had fooled us but in actual fact we knew what was happening,&quot; Chitala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNIP secretary general, Sebastian Zulu, on the same programme, maintained that UNIP would not accept the election results if issues on the electoral process were not ironed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Liato believes time to reason with this government is long gone and what is remaining now is a way forward - action by civic organisations and opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Let's try to reason with them, and if they don't want to reason with us who are the majority, then we can take action,&quot; Liato told the delegates represented by over 26 civic organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liato accused government of having its own agenda on national issues which it has reduced to party levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He challenged civic organisations and opposition political parties to make a stand against government on all contentious issues as government does not want to bargain anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liato pledged total support from ZCTU to whatever action civic organisation and opposition parties may take against government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Total lack of interest to the plight of the worker, which has put ZCTU at the most disadvantaged side has forced us to be very committed to discuss the issues of national interest, especially on the hottest issue of the voter process,&quot; Liato said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And National Party member of parliament Inonge Mbikusita-Lewanika told the convention that no amount of dialogue will move the MMD government to conceding that there is a political crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tried dialogue, but it has failed, all we need now is action, because everyone else has identified a problem but the MMD has refused to accept that we have a problem,&quot; she said, asking: &quot;What then are we going to discuss?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sata admitted on television that his government saw no problems, constitutional or otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Development Bank of Zambia and the Export and Import Bank of China yesterday signed an US$18 million loan agreement that will facilitate the rehabilitation of the &quot;cash strapped&quot; Mulungushi Textiles in Kabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signing the agreement at Lusaka's Pamodzi Hotel yesterday, DBZ managing director Gershom Mumba hailed the move by the EXIM Bank of China in the provision of resources for the rehabilitation exercise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The loan has come at the right time especially for Mulungushi Textiles limited and Kabwe residents in general. As you are aware, a number of industries in Kabwe, some of which were major employers like the mines, have closed down,&quot; Mumba noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This loan is going to revitalise Mulungushi Textiles Limited to such an extent that new employment levels are expected to exceed even the highest employment figures ever reached by the company,&quot; Mumba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And signing on behalf of the Chinese, EXIM Bank vice chairman, Wang Liansheng pledged to continue supporting the industries in the country to help boost the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wang further defined his bank's role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have four main roles the first being to provide loans to importers and exporters. To offer foreign assistance and also to provide concessionary loans to industries in developing countries,&quot; Wang said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US$18 million cash injection will improve the massive losses in the town's income generation following the closure of the mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's workforce is expected to rise over five times the current employment level of 200.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, as if that were not enough, Sanmukh finished fourth in the rally that claimed seven casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was really amazing,&quot; remarked rally chairman, Aaron Chungu, in an interview yesterday. &quot;He (Sanmukh) broke his right rear wheel near the Gwabi pontoon but managed to drive the remaining 120km on three wheels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trick, according to Chungu, was that when the right rear wheel came off the navigator, Paul Monge, stood on the driver's door to give the car equilibrium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the wheel broke off, they spent a night at Gwabi. However, the following morning the navigator stood on the drivers door and they managed to finish the course,&quot; Chungu claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally which was won by upstart Vedad Alavian took the drivers from the Lusaka Motor Sport club in the Showgrounds to Leopards, Susumani, Gwabi, Chirundu, Kariba Store, Sand Beach in Siavonga, where the drivers spent a night and back to Lusaka Motor Sports club.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Office of the Special Envoy, Kigali - Situation Report for September 1996, issued 2 October 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Main Developments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions between ethnic groups spread from Uvira to other towns in eastern Zaire, prompting demonstrations and threats against Banyamulenge--persons of Rwandese origin living in the south Kivu area--and aid organizations accused of involvement in reported security incidents along Zaire's border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released in Kinshasa on 13 September the government of Zaire stated that 'attackers had logistical support from certain United Nations agencies (and) foreign non-governmental organizations', leading the United Nations in turn to reject the allegations and urge the Government of Zaire 'to take steps to clarify the situation.' Exchange of heavy fire around Bukavu and Cyangugu between 22 and 24 September forced many humanitarian workers on the Zairian side to relocate to Nairobi and Goma, although essential activities and distributions in the camps have not been interrupted to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Regional Sanctions Co-ordinating Committee met twice during the month, most recently in Kigali on the 25th, to discuss the effectiveness and implementation of measures taken against the Burundi government. Taking note of the lifting of the ban on political parties and the restoration of the National Assembly, the Committee nonetheless stressed that 'the most important condition...is the immediate and unconditional negotiations with all groups.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant High Commissioner for Refugees Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello toured the Great Lakes Region between 22 and 28 September meeting with government officials and aid personnel in Bujumbura, Kigali, and Tanzania. The AHC's mission comes a week before UNHCR's one-week Executive Committee session, to be held in Geneva beginning 7 October, where the situation in the Great Lakes is expected to be a main topic of discussion. Later in October the High Commissioner will report on UNHCR's activities to the Third Committee of the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR announced on 24 September its decision to exclude from refugee status 20 Rwandese indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  Acting in accord with the UN Security Council resolution establishing the ICTR, which requires the cooperation of inter-governmental organizations and states in bringing to justice persons responsible for the genocide in Rwanda, the UNHCR believes that the indictments by the tribunal constitute sufficient grounds for exclusion within the meaning of the Statute of UNHCR, the 1951 Convention and the 1969 OAU Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a note sent to all Permanent Missions accredited to the UN, UNHCR urged 'States faced with requests for asylum from Rwandans indicted by the Tribunal to take similar measures.' Any individual indicted by the ICTR from now on will automatically be excluded from refugee status.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Federation of the Red Cross suspended its operations in Goma for a week after a bus carrying volunteers to Kibumba camp struck a mine on 7 September, killing two and injuring over thirty. The incident occurred within a few kilometers of the Goma airport on the main road serving the northern camps, in a section which was being resurfaced at the time--the job of repaving the northern axis is expected to last for another 10 months.  Taken after consultation with other agencies, the suspension did not affect food distribution or basic health care in the camps where the IFRC assures for these services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">500 refugees were to be moved on 1 October to the new site of Kahanda, which presently holds 6,000 persons transferred from other camps in a consolidation operation in Uvira. The effort will alleviate crowding and improve on the water and sanitation facilities ofsome of the older camps.  Refugees continue to arrive from northwest Burundi at the rate of approximately 20 a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rate of arrival of Burundese refugees in Kigoma area camps increased over September, from 1,728 during the first half of the month to 2,739 in the last two weeks. Mtendeli's population is now over 6,100 while a second site in Kasulu District, Nyarugusu, will be prepared in order to receive refugees by 1 December at the latest. The total for Kigoma camps stood at 43,241on 30 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good yields from two boreholes sunk in Kitali camp should permit the transfer of 20,000 refugees from Keza to begin before the end of October.  Water is also at issue for camps in the Greater Benaco area, where the debit from two streams in the Lukole Valley is being brought by pipeline to the IFRC treatment plant at K9 and may be used to supplement the supply in Benaco and Lumasi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Regional and District Commissioners for Kagera were to meet with the Prefect of Kibungo on 2 October in Rwanda to discuss repatriation. After a visit to Mwisa, the Principle Secretary for the Ministry of Home Affairs stated that the site designed for persons separated from other camps should be ready to open during the month of October.  Burundi 456 refugees have crossed into Bubanza Province, north of Bujumbura, from Zaire over the past weeks and have been grouped at Gihanga, where IFRC and MSF began preparing a site negotiated with authorities on 27 September. Another 244 refugees are present in Burundi's Cibitoke Province and may be shifted to the camp at Gihanga. The arrivals are predominantly persons who left Rwanda during the 1960's and consider themselves Rwandese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reintegration of Burundese still living in the former refugee camps in northern Burundi continues, with 91 moving from Magara on 27 September to communes in Ngozi Province, leaving 383 there, 600 in Ntamba and 1,000--down from over 5,100 when the camp was opened--in Rukuramigabo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">392 Burundese refugees from Kibangira camp in Cyangugu Prefecture were forced by authorities to return to Mugina Commune in Cibitoke Province on 30 September. UNHCR is in contact with the GoR over the action, which came after a small group from the camp returned to Cibitoke Province on a visit organized by the Governor of that province and officials from Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monitoring in Butare of the almost 80,000 who returned from Burundi during July and August shows that on average approximately seven per cent of returnees' houses are occupied while the rate of land use by others is around 10 per cent. The Human Rights Field Operation for Rwanda reports that 322 returnees were arrested between the 1st and the 20th of September, some of whom were subsequently released. 342 returnees were detained in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repatriation Statistics</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South African business has called for the formation of a special ministry of crime so that a concerted effort can be made to ensure law enforcement in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing in the quarterly political review of the South African Chamber of Business (SACOB), political analyst Professor Lawrence Schlemmer says crime in South Africa has reached proportions which elevate it to the status of a major threat to investment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business confidence, he adds, is being undermined by the rate of murder and violent crime, which is higher in South and Southern Africa than anywhere else in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some lawbreaking activity is so widespread as to overwhelm the capacity of the law,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schlemmer says that while unemployment is a significant contributing factor to crime, it cannot explain the estimated 700,000 cases of rape and sexual violence a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to start somewhere,&quot; he adds, &quot;and one has to ask whether the time has not come for a single ministry of crime? Should the cities not establish fully-fledged local police forces?.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SACOB review comes hard on the heels of increasing pressure from the country's opposition parties in parliament for President Nelson Mandela to establish a single ministry responsible for ending escalating crime in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have called for either a single ministry, or for the three ministries concerned--safety and security, justice and correctional services--to combine forces and work together to combat the crime wave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, they say, needs better-paid police officers with better training and equipment, as well as for detectives and prosecutors to cooperate in working against crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya - At least 50 million people in Africa face the risk of contracting sleeping sickness, scientifically known as trypanosomiasis, it was revealed here Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation was made by the permanent secretary in the Kenyan ministry of research, Wamatu Njoroge, during the opening of a five-day international trypanosomiasis meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, organized by the Food and Agricultural Organization in conjunction with the International Atomic Energy Organization, has attracted vector disease experts from all over the world. They will deliberate on methods of controlling the disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Njoroge said the 50 million figure could be an under-estimation since surveillance in endemic areas was difficult, hampering data collection on the disease, caused by tsetse flies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is compounded by shortage of skilled personnel, financial constraints and presence of other communicable diseases given priority in existing programs, he said in a message to the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that more than 10 million square kilometers (about 3.9 million square miles) of the African continent was tsetse-fly infested, adding that if cleared of the menace, this land surface could support an additional 120 million head of cattle and generate about one billion U.S. dollars annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that about 60 percent of Kenya's rangelands (about 25 percent of the total land mass) could not support livestock because of tsetse flies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Njoroge, trypanosomiasis was responsible for the under- exploitation of resources in the rangelands and concentration of livestock in limited grazing areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most tsetse-fly infested areas, he said, experience low rainfall and are not conducive to livestock keeping without massive reclamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The permanent secretary suggested that tsetse fly control programmes should take into account land use and water management practices which enhance environmental balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research by the Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research Institute, department of veterinary services, Kenya wildlife service and the International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology had brought the tsetse fly problem in Lambwe valley to manageable levels, said Njoroge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said though the tsetse fly related human disease was currently under control, the same could not be said of animal trypanosomiasis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the problem of drug-resistance increasing at an alarming rate, the most promising approach to control the tsetse-fly menace was by attacking the fly itself, the permanent secretary said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the integrated use of traps, insecticide impregnated targets, cattle dips and sterile insect technique (SIT) are expected to eradicate the fly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Njoroge said SIT, potentially an effective method of control, was effective in low density areas and possibilities of integrating it with other control techniques to mop up small residual tsetse fly populations should be explored.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Countries of southern Africa fear that a proposed trade agreement between South Africa and the European Union will hurt their commerce with the rest of sub-Sahara Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia has warned that the effects of any such agreement would need to be assessed carefully.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian Economic Policy Research Unit (NEPRU) points out that the Southern African Customs Union--which includes South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland--allows for free trade between its members, with one-third of all revenue to its common revenue pool going to its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed South African-EU agreement, NEPRU adds, could result in a large influx of highly competitive European products, causing South Africa to import even less from its neighbors in future. This could cost the union's common revenue pool up to 500 million U.S. dollars a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe has also expressed concern over possible repercussions of the proposed deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa is being unfair to the sub-region,&quot; says the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce. &quot;It would be prudent for South Africa to restructure multilateral trade imbalance in the region before the EU can grant it concessions for a free trade area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even without the threat of the new trade agreement, the regional trade balance in southern Africa is heavily in favor of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest statistics show that South Africa exports products worth 1.7 billion dollars a year to six other southern African countries. It imports goods worth 356 million dollars annually from these countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - Military doctors and paramedics were Wednesday deployed at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, crippled by a strike embarked upon by nurses and other unionised staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurses began a sit-in last week, demanding a pay rise of 100 percent, among others grievances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other unionized hospital workers, including mortuary attendants, joined the strike on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UTH public relations officer, Don Mwape, told PANA in Lusaka on Wednesday that medical personnel from the army, airforce, the Red Cross and staff from the health ministry had been called to assist the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paramilitary police Wednesday dispersed the striking workers from the hospital premises. Mwape said the management of the hospital would invite part-time and volunteer nurses to beef up available staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are now insisting that patients go to clinics to alleviate the problems here at the hospital, and in view of the on-going illegal work stoppage by some nurses, we urgently require part-time and volunteer nurses&quot; Mwape said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Secretary of the Civil Servants Union of Zambia, Japhet Moonde, said that his union had appealed to the striking workers to resume work since negotiations were going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moonde, who visited the hospital Wednesday, said the union was arranging a meeting with the striking workers to plead with them to return to work. The workers rejected similar pleas this week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday it was excluding from refugee status 20 people indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for their part in that country's genocide in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The indictments by the tribunal constitute sufficient grounds for exclusion from refugee status in accordance with its own mandate and the OAU (Organization of African Unity) convention,&quot; the U.N. refugee agency said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement from its Geneva headquarters Wednesday, the agency said governments should also deny asylum to those indictees seeking protection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Security Council resolution, which established the tribunal, requires the cooperation of inter-governmental, non-governmental organizations and states to arrest persons responsible for the mass killings and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20 Rwandans are believed to be among those behind the execution and planning of the genocide in which at least 500,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsi and moderate Hutu, were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of these Rwandans are in the custody of the tribunal. They include three who were arraigned June in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha. The others are known to be in Europe and elsewhere in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indicted Rwandans are Ignace Bagilishema, Charles Sikubwabo, Aloys Ndimbati, Vincent Rutaganira, Mika Muhimana, Ryandikayo, Obed Ruzindana, Clement Kayishema, Jean-Paul Akayesu, Anderson Georges Rutaganda Nderubumwe, Alfred Musema, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, Gerard Ntakirutimana, Andre Ntagerura, Ladislas Ntaganzwa, Anatole Nsengiyumva, Elie Ndayambaje, Ferdinand Nahimana, Theeoneste Bagosora and Eliezer Niyitegeka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, to which 131 states are party, sets out the criteria for recognition of refugees and standards for their treatment. The Convention also excludes any person considered to have committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity. A similar exclusion provision is found in the 1969 refugee convention of the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exclusions were the first announced by the agency on the basis of the tribunal's indictments since at least two million Rwandan refugees flooded into Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi following three months of civil war and genocide in Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - A Lagos cab driver, in a rare show of honesty, has returned 14,460 U.S. dollars forgotten in his car by a visiting Ivorian businessman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businessman Mamadou Coulibaly, on arrival at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport on an Air Gabon Flight from Congo last Sunday night, hired one of the airport cabs into Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he forgot the cash and the documents in the car when he disembarked.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A delighted Coulibaly, a regular visitor to Nigeria, told reporters in Lagos on Tuesday, after receiving the cash and documents, that the gesture had changed his impression about Nigeria and its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very happy. I had been given a bad impression about Nigeria, but today I am very impressed with what they (the drivers) have done and I now believe that there are great and honest Nigerians,&quot; he was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money and documents were returned to him by John Ogbonna, chairman of the airport car hire service association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogbonna, who did not identify the particular driver that returned the money, said his association worked as a responsible team. He used the occasion to debunk what he called propaganda against Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coulibaly's case adds to a growing series of show of public spirit by Nigerians in recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early this year, a Lagosian, not only rescued a Zairean lady accident victim, but also mortgaged his house to pay for the cost of surgery the lady underwent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, two members of Nigeria Airways cabin crew were honored for returning 6,000 U.S. dollars forgotten by a passenger on a London-Douala (Cameroon) flight on August 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crew members, Bulus Jonathan and Patience Oghoghome were honored by Owena Bank, based in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank also honored two employees of Eko Hotels in Lagos for turning in foreign currencies forgotten at different occasions by guests in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday Solarin returned 5,000 dollars, while Temitope Kazeem turned in 8, 705 dollars and 5,500 pounds sterling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also last year, a Nigerian police corporal returned one million naira, about (12,500 dollars) he found at an accident scene in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gesture earned him promotion as well as cash and car gifts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - During the genocide of 1994, Hutu militia groups and the Rwandan military regularly used rape and other sexual violence as weapons in their genocidal campaign against the Tutsi community. In Shattered Lives: Sexual Violence During the Rwandan Genocide and its Aftermath, released today, Human Rights Watch and the Federation Internationale des Ligues des Droits de l'Homme (FIDH) provide detailed and disturbing testimonies from women who survived horrific attacks on their families and themselves, only to face a future complicated by laws and practices that discriminate against them and social services that cannot begin to meet their needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch and FIDH call on the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), convening on September 26 in Arusha, to investigate and prosecute rape and other gender-related crimes. In addition, we urge the Rwandan government to ensure that women are guaranteed equal protection under domestic law and alert the international humanitarian community to the necessity for their humanitarian programs to address women's needs, especially in the areas of health care, trauma counseling, housing, credit, and education. &quot;The genocide in Rwanda left a population that is 70% female, and the stories told by survivors defy comprehension. What is clear is that Rwanda will only rebuild itself through these women, and the international community must do everything possible to help them deal effectively with the past in order to move productively into the future,&quot; said Dorothy Q. Thomas, director of the Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the exact number of rapes that occurred in Rwanda may never be known, testimonies in the 104-page report confirm that rape was extremely widespread and that women were individually raped, gang-raped, raped with objects such as sharpened sticks or gun barrels, held in sexual slavery or sexually mutilated. These crimes were frequently part of a pattern in which women were raped after they had witnessed the torture and killings of their relatives and the destruction and looting of their homes. Women from both the Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups were raped, although most rape and other forms of violence were targeted against Tutsi women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until very recently, the ICTR largely neglected its responsibility to investigate and prosecute rape. It has to date issued no indictments for rape and other forms of sexual violence. Initial investigations were hampered by serious methodological flaws, including investigative procedures which were not conducive to eliciting rape testimonies from Rwandan women. In July 1996, the International Tribunal took the welcome step of forming a sexual assault committee to coordinate the examination of gender-based violence and has begun to investigate such abuse. However, unless the ICTR takes further steps to incorporate attention to sexual violence into its overall work, rape and other gender-based crimes could go unpunished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch and FIDH call on the ICTR to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- fully investigate and prosecute, where appropriate, rape, sexual slavery and sexual mutilation as crimes against humanity, genocide crimes, or war crimes;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- ensure that the issue of violence against women is treated with the same gravity as other crimes in its jurisdiction;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- amend its investigative procedures and methodology, which have largely failed to elicit rape testimonies, to ensure that investigations of rape and other forms of sexual violence are conducted by teams that include women investigators and interpreters skilled in interviewing women survivors of gender-based violence;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- and strengthen and expand its Witness Protection Unit to ensure that victims and witnesses are protected against potential reprisals and given the appropriate support services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gender-based crimes are even more likely to go unpunished given that the Rwandan judicial system is still not functioning. In August 1996, the Rwandan legislature passed a law which authorizes prosecution of crimes committed during the genocide, including rape. However, the likelihood of any rape prosecutions, even with a functioning judiciary, is remote given the lack of investigation into cases of rape and sexual violence and given the discriminatory attitudes towards gender-based crimes on the part of local police inspectors collecting evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch and FIDH call on the Rwandan government to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- fully investigate and prosecute the sexual violence that took place during the genocide;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- and ensure that all police inspectors receive mandatory training on the issue of rape and other sexual abuse, including their status as crimes punishable by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Rwandan women work to rebuild their lives in the wake of the genocide, they must struggle to make ends meet, to reclaim their property, to rebuild their destroyed homes and to raise surviving children, both their own and orphans. These problems are compounded by their second class status under Rwandan law. Many widows have been unable to return to their property because of discriminatory practices in customary law which often deny them the right to inherit. The government has initiated a legal commission to address these issues and to introduce legislation to allow women to inherit equally with men, but the reforms are expected to take a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch and FIDH call on the Rwandan government to ensure that legal reforms eliminating discrimination are adopted expeditiously and to upholds its obligations under International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights an the Convention on the Elimination All Forms of Discrimination Against Women to ensure that Rwandan women are guaranteed equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation of women in Rwanda cries out for a stepped up humanitarian response from both the international community and the Rwandan government.  Since July 1994, international donors have expended approximately $2.5 billion on the Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire and Tanzania, while devoting only $572 million to Rwanda itself. Of that, a negligible amount is targeted for gender-related issues, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of the country is female. Only a few aid programs address the specific needs of Rwanda's women and the United Nations Field Operation in Rwanda, which has a mandate to protect and promote human rights, is not addressing the current discrimination against women. The Rwandan government, while concerned about these women's pressing needs, has yet to develop a coordinated strategy to respond to these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch and FIDH call on the international community and the Rwandan government to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- ensure that aid programs do not neglect women's needs, especially in the areas of criminal justice, health care, housing, credit, education, vocational training, and trauma counseling. To the degree possible, programs for rape survivors should be integrated into broader programs to ensure that rape survivors are not further stigmatized;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- provide support for training judicial and law enforcement personnel particularly investigators of genocide crimes on gender-based crimes against women. Programs should also be devised to enhance the recruitment of women investigators;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- ensure adequate financial and logistical support for the ICTR and the UN Human Rights Field Operation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- and increase the cooperation and coordination among different government ministries with the aim of improving the social, medical and legal responses to women's needs in the aftermath of the genocide. An inter- ministerial task force should be created to deal with the violence inflicted on women during the genocide and related current problems facing women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This report is based on an investigative mission to Rwanda by Human Rights Watch and FIDH in March and April 1996. Researchers conducted interviews with victims of rape and sexual violence and current abuses in six of Rwanda's eleven prefectures. Human Rights Watch/FIDH also met with a wide array of non- governmental human rights and women's rights organizations, social workers, journalists, doctors, nurses, government officials and representatives of the International Tribunal and humanitarian organizations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - This is number 27 (16 - 22 September) in a series of weekly reports from IRIN on general developments in the Great Lakes region. Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is sending Ibrahima Fall, UN Assistant Secretary-General, to Kinshasa for discussions with the Zairean authorities to clarify misunderstandings on the role and operations of the UNHCR, it was announced on Thursday. The mission was prompted by accusations from the Government of Zaire that the UNHCR had provided logistic support to armed groups infiltrating Zaire from Rwanda and Burundi. Two UN staff were beaten by Zairean Army soldiers. The Secretary-General had earlier in the week expressed concern at the Zairian allegations. The mission, due to leave as soon as possible, will include representatives of both UNHCR and the International Organisation of Migration (IOM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activities of IOM in Zaire have been suspended. Zaire government spokesman Oscar Lugendo reportedly said on 22 September, 'The IOM, which has gone beyond the framework envisaged in the cooperation accords it signed with Zaire, has been banned until further notice from operating on our territory.' Zaire will 'systematically identify all humanitarian NGOs and evaluate all their activities', he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a continuing escalation of insecurity in South Kivu, Zaire, heavy arms fire across the border of Rwanda and Zaire was reported overnight on Sunday at Bukavu. Mortar-fire, rockets and automatic fire could be heard but no casualty toll has been reported nor any official explanation given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Amnesty International has accused the Zairean security forces and government officials of committing atrocities against members of the Banyamulenge community in South Kivu. In a statement issued on Saturday, Amnesty said that though they understood the Zairean authorities' right to take action against armed opponents, 'there is no justification for this calculated abuse of human rights - including unlawful killings, disappearances, severe beatings and deportation or 'refoulement' to another country.' Some 217 people of Banyamulenge origin were expelled from Uvira to Rwanda by the Zairean authorities during last week, according to UN sources, and several hundred people have fled Zaire to take refuge in western provinces of Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty singled out Kyembwa wa Lumona, the District Commissioner of Uvira, for criticism, citing reports that he had authorized the enrolment of youths into the armed forces to fight the Tutsis and said that houses vacated by Tutsi would be given over to army officers. On Wednesday Amnesty welcomed the release from detention of four &quot;prisoners of conscience&quot;, all from CADDHOM (Collectif d'action pour le developpment des droits de l'homme), who had been the subject of an Amnesty urgent appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About two hundred Zairians are reported on 16 September to have fled their homes and sought refuge in Ntoroko in Uganda's Bundibugyo district. The new influx is reported, ironically, at a time when 2,000 other Zairian refugees were leaving camps in western Uganda to return home. The returnees are from some 6,000 Zairians who crossed into Uganda early in the year. According to Uganda's New Vision newspaper, the new refugee arrivals were fleeing fighting between Zaire government troops and armed rebels inside Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Pierre Buyoya, Burundi's leader who came to power in a military coup d'etat in July, said on Sunday that continued sanctions on Burundi were destroying the peace process and could plunge the country into further violence. Buyoya called on the regional leaders to lift the sanctions imposed by regional leaders following the coup. In an interview with the East African newspaper published on 23 September, Buyoya said that he may cut short his planned three years of military rule if the internal situation in Burundi is brought under control. He also said that he was ready to start negotiations with armed factions, one of the conditions under which sanctions will be lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next meeting of the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC), is scheduled to take place in Kigali on Wednesday 25 September. The meeting will assess the impact of sanctions and requests for exemptions. Since the loosening of sanctions decided by the RSCC at Arusha on 6 September for humanitarian agencies, WFP has organized flights to and from Nairobi on behalf of the UN system and NGOs and arrangements are in hand to import fuel overland for the humanitarian community during the coming week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The leader of Burundi's National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), Leonard Nyangoma, said on Friday that he had taken over the leadership of the main Hutu political party, Frodebu. Five members of the Hutu-dominated Frodebu, including Nyangoma, said that they made up a majority of surviving members of the party's management committee and had appointed the rebel leader as party president. In Dar es Salaam, Frodebu president, Jean Minani insisted that he remained the party's leader and that there was no formal coalition between Frodebu and the CNDD. The CNDD said on Wednesday they were prepared to open talks with Burundi's new regime under certain conditions, but repeated their support for sanctions imposed by the regional states. Nyangoma said his party was willing to negotiate but only with those who had not taken part in the planning and execution of the 1993 attempted coup d'etat during which the country's first Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, was murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Thousands of Catholics paid their last respects on Tuesday to Burundi's archbishop Joachim Ruhuna who was murdered in an ambush north of Gitega last week. The body of the archbishop was seen by witnesses burning in his vehicle after the ambush but subsequently disappeared. Soldiers found the bodies of the archbishop and a nun eight days after they had been killed in a shallow grave some three kiometers away from the scene of the attack. The archbishop was buried on 19 September. Four people survived the attack. The rebels and the Army blame each other for the murders. Pope John Paul's special envoy at Tuesday's memorial service in Gitega appealed for an end to the slaughter.  The US Catholic Bishops' Conference and the OAU condemned the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Burundian military reported that three people were killed and others wounded when rebels opened fire on their minibus near Rumonge, less than 50 miles from the capital, Bujumbura. Small ambushes such as this are apparently becoming more frequent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* US congressman, Harry Johnstone suggested on Tuesday that the international community should work together to close down the camps for Rwandan refugees in Eastern Zaire and Tanzania. Following talks in Rwanda with government officials and in Kenya with refugee leaders, Johnstone said that an option would be to stop feeding the refugees. He suggested that an UN security force may be required to escort the refugees across the border and guarentee security to returning refugees. The food situation in refugee camps in Goma, meanwhile, has been critical following the ban imposed by a major donor on deliveries of its food aid donations pending the production of viable refugee figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP expects an improvement in the food supply situation as trucks arrive from Uganda. A planned three-day census of Rwandan refugees in Goma had to be suspended earlier in the month, following a boycott by the refugees. UNHCR, WFP and the Government of Zaire have met in Goma to discuss a new date for the verification exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Tanzanian Foreign Minister said on Friday that he feared Rwandan refugees in Tanzania would turn part of the country into a barren desert. The Foreign Minister on a visit to Algiers told news media that the 900,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees in Tanzania were competing with local people for scant resources and threatening the area with an environmental disaster.  In addition, he said that the local people wanted the refugees to go home because of rape, attacks and burglaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* US Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, will visit the region beginning 8 October, for a series of meetings with regional leaders.  Presidents Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda have been invited to Arusha to meet with Mr. Christopher during his visit to Tanzania.  In Arusha, the Secretary of State will meet with President Benjamin Mkapa and former president Julius Nyerere. Discussions will centre on bilateral relations as well as on the Rwanda and Burundi situations. In an earlier stop in Addis Ababa, he will meet with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim. Mr. Christopher will also visit Mali, Angola and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A Rwandan national has been arrested in Nairobi charged with genocide and crimes against humanity - the first arrest in Kenya in connection with the 1994 massacres in Rwanda. Obed Ruzindana, a former trader, is on the list of eight suspects who were indicted by the UN International Tribunal in December.  One of those indicted with Ruzindana, former Kibuye police chief, Clement Kayishema is being detained at the Tribunal headquarters in Arusha. Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi had initally refused to cooperate with the Tribunal but subsequently changed his position. So far some 20 genocide suspects have been arrested. The first trial - that of former mayor Jean-Paul Akayesu - was scheduled to begin on 26 September, but is likely to be delayed. Earlier this week Akayesu's defence counsel and other lawyers for some of the accused lashed out at the Tribunal saying that it did not respect the rights of lawyers. Belgian lawyer, John Scheers said that he had not been given all the files relating to his case. His colleague Luc de Temmerman who is due to defend Georges Rutaganda, will also be in Tanzania this week but will ask for a postponement. Temmerman said that his client is seriously ill and in need of medical attention. Both Akayesu and Rutaganda pleaded not guilty at their preliminary hearings in May. A third lawyer, Andre Ferran, of France who is due in November to defend the former prefet of Kibuye, Clement Kayishema, was also strongly critical of the Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* More than 100 investment projects worth US$ 950.85 million will be promoted at Tanzania's first international investment forum in November.  Projects include agro-industry, tourism, mining, infrastructure, chemicals, paper, textiles, and pharmaceuticals. The forum will take place 5-8 November in Dar es Salaam. Since the introduction of trade liberalisation in 1985, the Tanzanian government has initiated economic reforms that have included cutting controls on foreign currency trading, allowing market-driven interest rates and creating the independent Tanzania Revenue Authority. The UN is providing US$ 750,000 in organisational and logistical support for the forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is likely to restore Tanzania's credit facilities suspended since 1992 has raised confidence in the prospects for economic revival. Leading businessmen in Dar es Salaam, however, have warned that Tanzania still has far to go to emerge from the list of the world's poorest countries. IMF's representative in Tanzania said that final talks were underway for an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility worth about US$ 234 million to be approved by October. The approval of the ESAF would lead to a resumption of donor aid now suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni on a four day visit to Tanzania has urged East African countries to remove remaining trade barriers in order to promote cooperation in the region. Rwanda's Vice President, Paul Kagame, on Friday called for greater involvement by South Africa in trying to solve the crisis in the Great Lakes region. Kagame said that he was satisfied that the government of South Africa understood what was happening in the region.  Kagame, who is also Rwanda's Minister of Defence, made his remarks during a four-day visit to South Africa aimed at persuading Pretoria to exercise its position as a regional power. Last month South Africa announced its support for a peace initative launched by leaders in the Great Lakes region aimed at normalising the situation in Burundi. It appointed a special envoy to help peace efforts in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Uganda accused Sudan of dropping around ten bombs from MiG aircraft near Moyo, 16 km inside Uganda's northwestern border on 22nd September, and pledged to retaliate. The news comes despite a recent agreement on 9 September between Uganda and Sudan brokered by Iranian President Akbar Hasemi Rafsanjani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lord's Resistence Army (LRA) rebels have killed an average of 25 people daily for the last two weeks in Gulu district, Ugandan security officials said at the weekend. The attacks have been concentrated mainly in Aswa and Omoro counties. The Ugandan Army is reported to be seeking permission to evacuate villagers to safer areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ugandan government said on Friday that it was ready to meet with rebels of the West Nile Bank Front operating in the western region of the country from bases in Zaire and southern Sudan. Uganda's deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism made his remarks duing a parliamentary committee hearing on the war in northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The plight of refugees is being discussed this week at the 4th Pan African Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent which opened in Kampala on Sunday. More than 300 delegates from 53 soceties in Africa will review how best to assist refugees in the wake of increasing conflict in the continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farmers union president, Mr. Ajai Vashee said in a statement released in Lusaka today that the ministry should announce whether they will import fertiliser for this season and how much would be imported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He charged that if the policy on fertiliser is not well publicised, the private sector fertiliser supply initiatives will not take off which would lead to a shortage of the commodity in the coming season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Vashee further disclosed that farmers and fertiliser distributers are anxious to know whether government would import fertiliser supplies from outside Africa and when the commodity is expected to arrive in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if government intends to make stocks of basal dressing available to farmers on time, it should place it's orders now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Livestock industry in Zambia is heading for a total collapse if the current problems affecting the industry are not addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was revealed during the launching of the Livestock Production Society of Zambia which took place at Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Zambia Animal Science Department lecturer, Judy Lungu, said the livestock industry has been neglected for a long time. This is because agriculture in Zambia is associated only with crops, she said. She continued that only seven per cent of agriculture budgetary allocation goes to livestock production.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the same function, deputy agricultural minister Matthias Mpande agreed with Lungu, adding that the following are some of the major constraints the livestock industry is facing;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* lack of adequate credit facilities to livestock farmers;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* unimproved livestock extension services;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* poor extension-farmer, research-extension, research-farmer linkages;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* inadequate staffing;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* poor human resource development;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* weak livestock delivery system; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* poor land tenure system which was a disservice to livestock farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpande said his ministry had identified these constraints and is tackling them. He said the Agricultural Sector Investment Programme (ASIP) has animal production and health sub-programme to address such problems affecting the livestock industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zambia Institute of Animal Health (ZIAH), lecturer who is a stockfeed production consultant in Mazabuka said in addressing any problem, there is need to formulate an appropriate policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said policy is a major tool of change. Livestock industry is dying because of policies which allow importation of livestock products without considering the effects of such imports on local industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there should be import quotas, and the larger part of livestock products should come from local livestock industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, an agriculture extension officer speaking in Monze last Friday, Cosmas Malawo, said though there were a number of high quality imported livestock products on the market, they did not benefit the local small scale farmer who is increasingly unable to purchase them because of the costs involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cattle have died in Southern Province not only because of the corridor disease but because the owners literally can not afford to look after their cattle. If there was more local production of livestock products in Zambia, peasant farmers might even be able to form groups and donate towards the purchase of drugs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the Province with the highest numbers of livestock, the population of cattle and sheep in Southern Province has decimated to drastically low levels prompting a K200 million drugs donation from IFAD to try and arrest the trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We might have adopted a market economy, but the government should realise that some sectors may be wiped out if they are not assisted,&quot; Malawo said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Chichele plantation currently being managed by the Zambia Forestry and Forest Industry Company (ZAFFICO) will not be privatised together with the sawmill, Parliament heard yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environment minister, William Harrington, made this clarification after Kafue MMD member of parliament, Yusuf Badat, asked him who will take over the management of the plantation after the ZAFFICO sawmill is privatised as scheduled in tranche six.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the ZAFFICO sawmill is earmarked for privatisation in tranche six, we have to de-link the two,&quot; Harrington said, explaining: &quot;The plantation covers an area of 55,000 hectares. No responsible government would put such a vast land under private hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harrington stressed that only the sawmill will be privatised while government &quot;will hold ownership of the plantation on behalf of the people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are examining various ways of managing the forest, including the transformation of the forestry department into a commercial enterprise,&quot; Harrington said. &quot;A study is underway to transform the forest department into what will be known as the Zambia Forest Authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This response, however, drew a point of order from UNIP's Feira member of parliament, retired Major General Tom Fara, who pointed out that Harrington had made no mention of the Mwekera Forestry Training School and the fish farm which is located within the plantation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is the minister aware that the Southern African Development Conference (SADC) is eyeing the school to turn it into a SADC Forestry Training School?&quot; General Fara asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harrington replied that he was &quot;very aware&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what the study is meant to address,&quot; Harrington said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The government has no intentions of putting in place measures to prevent lending institutions from harassing small scale farmers for the loans they received during the 1993 to 1995 agricultural seasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Replying to a question raised by Mwinilunga West MMD member of parliament, Peter Mpashi, who wanted to know whether his ministry would protect small scale farmers whose properties are being seized by lending institutions for failing to re-pay the loans, agriculture deputy minister Mathias Mpande said the government has no intentions of putting in place a debt relief incentive programme for small scale farmers who got loans between 1993 and 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Loans are contractual obligations and have to be honoured,&quot; Mpande said, but hinted that government had worked out a debt relief incentive programme for thirty-one districts which were adversely affected by drought over the said period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter, however, prompted Chisamba MMD member of parliament, Reuben Musakabantu, to ask Mpande whether the list of names for the farmers who have been given this relief is available for scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, the names are available,&quot; Mpande assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lending institutions involved include the Credit Union Savings Association (CUSA), Lima Bank and the Zambia Co-operative Federation (ZCF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile agricultural deputy minister Dickson Matutu disclosed in Parliament yesterday that government is working out a new Agricultural Credit Act to protect lending institutions from willful defaulters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matutu was responding to a question by Masaiti MMD member of parliament, Jazzman Chikwaka, who wanted to know what assistance government was rendering to small scale farmers involved in cotton production.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba says his predecessor Kenneth Kaunda should convince all Zambians to alter the Constitution that bars him from contesting next month's presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But President Chiluba, in a telephone call to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, claimed former president Kaunda did not respect him and his idea of dialogue is a meeting in a big hall and in the presence of journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The telephone call was made on September 10 after talks with the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) and the conversation was narrated to UNIP president Kaunda and Liberal Progressive Front chairman, Rodger Chongwe, by President Mugabe at a meeting in Harare on September 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And last week President Chiluba told The Financial Gazette, Zimbabwe's leading financial independent paper, during the World Solar Summit in Harare that it was Zambian laws, not him, that disqualified former president Kaunda and other non-indigenous Zambians from running for public office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not bar individuals from contesting ... those who are eligible will contest,&quot; President Chiluba said in an interview. &quot;We don't know whether Kaunda can come up with his own supernatural constitution that supersedes the one we have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba added: &quot;We believe that constitutions are matters for individual nations. If they decide on a constitution it is their right to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Chongwe, in an interview yesterday, said President Chiluba's call to President Mugabe on September 10 was announcing his agreement with the ZDC which he said he would shortly make public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe, who met Mugabe on September 11 in Harare with his security minister Dr Sidney Sekeremayi and UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda who also confirmed the conversation, said President Chiluba told President Mugabe that ZDC had raised eight points and they had agreed on four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He claimed that the most difficult person in Zambia was Kaunda who had even broken off talks,&quot; Chongwe said, adding: &quot;About those points not agreed, Chiluba did not tell Mugabe that these related to the Constitution and the voters register. So Mugabe appreciated that we were able to tell him the truth about Chiluba's bilateral meetings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe added that their meeting with Mugabe exposed Chiluba's lies about Kaunda, especially in regard to the interparty meetings where Chiluba claims the former president did not want one-to-one meetings because he wants to play to the gallery of reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Financial Gazette writes that the amended Constitution, which many people believe was targeted at UNIP president Kaunda whose parents came from Malawi although it is not clear where they originated from, drafted largely by the MMD and enacted into law last May, bars non-indigenous Zambians from contesting presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba recently invited the UNIP president to discuss, among other issues, the controversial constitution. But the talks failed to produce conclusive results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile over the last three months several donor countries and organisations have been threatening to cut the much needed economic aid to the impoverished country, saying the constitutional amendments put in place by President Chiluba were undemocratic and dictatorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But President Chiluba appears undaunted by donor threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think people make constitutions to make money,&quot; President Chiluba said. &quot;So I believe that the people of Zambia, although they are not economically fit, must determine their own destiny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to world condemnation, the 12-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) has expressed concern at constitutional changes adopted by President Chiluba's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba has, however, constantly snubbed his SADC colleagues claiming the problem was a national issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba said Zambians had, as early as 1972, demanded constitutional changes when Kaunda was in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was one party dictatorial government but since 1972 people wanted to have an indigenous Zambian for their leader,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, when he received a draft of the amendments to the constitution, President Chiluba claimed that &quot;constitutions everywhere in the world are discriminatory in one way or the other&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambians should not be too expectant of the document because there is no constitution that does not discriminate,&quot; President Chiluba warned. &quot; I have never heard of a constitution that takes care of the interests of all citizens, hence, we cannot think of a completely non-discriminatory document here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And President Chiluba was yesterday advised by Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president, Alfred Zulu, to take note of the 13 recommendations made by the Commonwealth Human rights Initiative (CHRI) in order to save Zambia's young democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Chiluba cannot continue ignoring the overwhelming view taken by international organisations, NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and friendly governments that remedial summer saults must be made instead of sending envoys on fruitless diplomatic consultative missions...,&quot; Zulu said in a press statement released in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CHRI team visited Zambia on a fact finding mission between August 27 and September 5, this year and warned against any delays in helping Zambia in her situation because &quot;the shortage of time is a critical factor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst the recommendations are that the government should open itself up for dialogue, consider a constituent assembly for broadened constitutional debate and desists from forcing an election on Zambians without ironing out the pressing problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But MMD national secretary, minister without portfolio Michael Sata, recently said although government was ready to dialogue with all the parties such talks will not include the Constitution as it was now law and not open for any further debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sata also maintained that his government saw no problems in Zambia - constitutional or otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zulu said the government has not made adequate attempts to amicably move the obstacles and resolve the internal conflicts which have been heightened by the failed one to one inter-party talks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. At the kind invitation of the Government of the Republic of Rwanda, the Regional Sanctions Co-ordinating Committee held its 2nd meeting in Kigali, Rwanda on 25 September, 1996 under its Chairman H.E. Major-General M.S.H.  SARAKIKYA, High Commissioner of Tanzania to Kenya. Representatives from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and the OAU Secretariat attended the meeting. Zaire and the OAU current Chairman were not represented.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Committee reviewed the recent developments in Burundi, the implementation of Sanctions and noted that the Sanctions have so far been effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Committee considered the requests for exemptions made by various U.N.  Agencies and the Diplomatic corps based in Bujumbura and recommended that the exemptions given so far including those related to fertilizer and vegetable seeds are sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Committee took note of the positive steps taken by the BUYOYA regime towards meeting the conditions set out by the Arusha II Summit, namely the lifting of the ban on political parties and the restoration of the National Assembly. However, the Committee stressed that the most important condition yet to be fully met is the immediate and unconditional negotiations with all groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In view of the steps taken so far by the BUYOYA regime, the Committee recommended that Major BUYOYA be invited to be available during the forthcoming Summit.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Committee underscored the fact that the sanctions were not imposed for the benefit of, or to the detriment of any group or political faction.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The Committee reiterated the need for coordination, harmonization and information-sharing among all the participating countries in order to maintain cohesion and unity of purpose in all matters pertaining to the Sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - This is number 26 (9 - 15 September 1996) in a series of weekly reports from the UN DHA Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN) on general developments in the Great Lakes region. Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Major Pierre Buyoya, leader of Burundi's governing regime, agreed to unban political parties and reinstitute the suspended National Assembly according to a Radio Burundi broadcast on Thursday. The statement, read by Pierre-Claver Ndayicariye, the Minister of Communications, said the decision was made by the Council of Ministers in a meeting on Thursday afternoon. The meeting decided that &quot;the national assembly is restored within the legal framework of the transitional institutional system&quot; and that &quot;political parties and associations of a political nature are authorised to resume their activities within the context of the law.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move was welcomed by Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN Secretary-General, as &quot;extremely positive&quot;, while Marc Faguy, the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Burundi described it as &quot;a step in the right direction and an excellent response&quot;. However, the major Hutu political and military movements were less enthusiastic. FRODEBU described the decision as a &quot;totally unacceptable masquerade&quot; and said Major Buyoya was &quot;making fun of the Burundi people and the international community&quot;. The CNDD described the move as &quot;a positive step but insufficient&quot;, a statement that surprised some observers by the moderation of its tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was condemned by a FRODEBU MP, Joseph Ntakarutimana, speaking on behalf of other exiled politicians. &quot;Parliament cannot function while most of the MPs of the majority party, FRODEBU, have been forced to go into exile and others assassinated by the army or Tutsi militias while their killers enjoy total impunity,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An increasing number of FRODEBU MPs in exile are switching their allegiance to the CNDD. A group of 16 FRODEBU deputies living as exiles in Uvira, Zaire, announced their 'unconditional support' for the CNDD and its armed campaign in Burundi in a statement released on Tuesday in Nairobi. On Tuesday 2 September, 22 FRODEBU parliamentarians in Tanzania had announced their support for the CNDD, joining three FRODEBU parliamentarians in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional Governments who imposed the sanctions on Burundi have yet to respond to the decision. The move meets two of the three conditions for the suspension of sanctions laid down by the Arusha II summit on 31 July, but not the condition that the regime undertake 'immediate and unconditional talks with all groups within and outside the country', a clear reference to Hutu rebel groups who have been fighting the army within the country and from bases in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Burundi, Joachim Ruhuna, was still missing at the end of last week and believed to have been murdered after the discovery of his burnt car last Tuesday. His vehicle was found in a valley near Bugendana town in Gitega province, with traces of blood and burnt clothing beside it. A nun travelling with him was missing, but the body of another woman was found. The Burundian army confirmed on Thursday church reports that four other people travelling with the archbishop had survived the attack, the archbishop's driver, a woman accountant and two schoolgirls.  The army had previously stated that only the driver had survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army reported a deacon as saying that he had discovered the burning car on Monday shortly after the attack, with the bodies of the archbishop and a nun burning inside. The deacon had reportedly pulled the bodies out of the car and gone to seek help, but found the archbishop's body missing by the time he returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army blames Hutu rebels for the archbishop's death. However, the CNDD's spokesman, Jerome Ndiho, on Wednesday denied that Hutu rebels carried out the killing and claimed the army were responsible. Monsignor Ruhuna, a Tutsi, was regarded as a force for moderation in Burundi and had been an outspoken critic of violence by all parties to the conflict. His killing has been condemned by political leaders around the world and the Pope, who expressed his &quot;deep pain&quot; at the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN officials have welcomed the decision by the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee to exempt certain classes of relief items from the sanctions on Burundi. The decision on Friday 6 September followed concerns from humanitarian agencies that the sweeping sanctions would bring the whole emergency relief effort in Burundi to a halt. The full Sanctions Committee statement, which includes details of which relief items have been exempted, is available from IRIN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the Federation Internationale des Ligues des Droits de L'Homme (FIDH) called on Monday for the creation of an ad hoc international tribunal to prosecute those charged with 'massive human rights violations in Burundi'. The human rights organizations condemned as 'shocking' the conclusion of the UN Commission of Inquiry for Burundi report that '(t)o make the suppression of impunity a precondition for the solution of the crisis is completely unrealistic'. They also argued that this conclusion contradicts Security Council Resolution 1012 of August 1995 which established the Commission to 'recommend legal, political and adminstrative measures to bring to justice those responsible for the acts'. HRW/FIDH said that '(t)o turn away from such clear evidence of guilt would... invite continuing violence not only in Burundi, but also elsewhere in the world.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Reports from Uvira in South Kivu, Zaire, indicate growing tension and conflict between local authorities, local people, Zairean soldiers and Banyamulenge, Zairean Tutsis of Rwandan expression. On Monday local people declared Uvira town a &quot;dead city&quot;, demonstrating against Banyamulenge and attacking their property. This prompted large numbers of Tutsis to seek refuge at UNHCR in Uvira. Some 220 people have since been arrested and taken to Luberizi military camp, while at least three Tutsis and four Zairean soldiers have been killed in the past week. Some 50 people were expelled to Rwanda by the Zairean authorities on Saturday, most of whom were Banyamulenge.  An estimated 30 Zairean Tutsis and three Zairean soldiers are reported to have died in fighting in the area during the week beginning Monday 2 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean army is conducting a military operation in the hills around Uvira town, and more troops have been despatched from Goma, Bukavu, Shaba and Kinshasa. Zairean army chief of staff Major General Eluki Monga is reported to have arrived in Uvira to supervise the operation, which the authorities claim is designed to counter Tutsis seeking to &quot;destabilize eastern Zaire&quot;.  They also claim that the Rwandese Patriotic Army has been training the Banyamulenge and that Burundi has been providing them with rear bases. The Governor has declared the area between Uvira and Fizi closed to foreign aid organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Rwanda and Burundi have categorically rejected these charges, while local Tutsis have claimed that Rwanda's Former Government Army and the Interahamwe are targetting the Tutsis alongside the local authorities and army. They say that, as in the case of Masisi, regional political tensions are being used as a pretext for targetting Tutsis simply in order to take their property and cattle. The Tutsis from Masisi were forced to flee from Zaire to Rwanda earlier this year when they were targetted by the local authorities and the army. There is substantial evidence that Hutu extremists from the refugee camps played a leading role in this process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zaire's military pledged its support on Monday to the institutions governing the country's democratic transition, following rumours of a military coup in the absence of President Mobutu. The President is out of the country, recovering from a prostate operation in Switzerland. A military statement broadcast on state radio said that the military high command rejoiced at the success of the operation and affirmed its support for the electoral calender leading to elections next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Uganda and Sudan announced on Tuesday their decision to normalise diplomatic relations and not to support rebel forces operating from the territories of each other's country. The decision, brokered by Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, commits both parties to a series of measures including: to stop immediately official propaganda campaigns against the other party; to prevent any elements hostile to the other party from using its territory against the other; to end direct or indirect assistance to hostile elements, and to move all refugees and all elements hostile to the other party from the border to an area not less than 100 km inside the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda severed diplomatic ties with Sudan in April 1995, accusing the Khartoum Government of supporting Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels in the north of the country. Sudan, for its part, accused Uganda of supporting the Sudan People's Liberation Army in its war to end domination of the south by the north. The LRA said on Wednesday that the decision would not affect its armed campaign in northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Pierre Celestin Rwigema, Prime Minister of Rwanda, announced on Tuesday the resignation of Justice Minister Martha Mukamurenzi, following the disclosure that she had misappropriated public funds. According to Information Minister, Jean-Pierre Bizimana, Ms Mukamurenzi misappropriated 27 million Rwandan francs ($90,000), most of which she spent on &quot;her personal needs&quot;. The former Justice Minister will not be prosecuted as she has received a presidential pardon. &quot;She was taking money, and then putting it back. She has replaced almost everything she stole. She has asked for forgiveness, so we are not going to prosecute her,&quot; Bizimana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The International Tribunal for Rwanda will start the trial of three suspects being held in Tanzania on 26 September. The three are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity during the genocide which claimed an estimated 800,000 lives between April and June 1994. Proceedings against Jean Paul Akayesu, who is accused of killing 2,000 Tutsis in Taba, will open the hearings in Arusha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The arms embargo against the Rwandese Government was totally lifted on 1 September, such that the Government is no longer required to report on arms that it is importing. The announcement was made last week by the Chairman of the UN Security Council Committee established by resolution 918 (1994) to monitor the arms embargo. The full arms embargo will still apply in relation to non-governmental forces in Rwanda and 'to persons in the States neighbouring Rwanda if such sale or supply is for the purpose of the use of such arms or material within Rwanda.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Tanzanian and Iranian Governments have agreed to strengthen trade and technical ties between their countries, after a large delegation headed by Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani visited Tanzania last week.  The two countries agreed to cooperate further in trade, agriculture, education, health and communications during talks held on Monday. The visit by the Iranian delegation was part of an African tour which also included visits to Kenya and Uganda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The Road Transport Authority announced here yesterday that the lifting of the tariff control and its determination by the market has enabled tank truck owners to distribute fuel to areas which had previously been beyond their reach.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the tariff control system there was hardly any truck intending to go to Gondar as the result of which there was serious shortage of fuel there, the official said, adding now 28 trucks with trailers have travelled to the area since the decision that the tariff should be negotiated between the truck owners and distributors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wollo, part of the Amhara Regional State also gets ten trucks of fuel daily through the Ethiopian Petroleum Corporation, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the official, no disagreements have surfaced so far between truck owners and distributors on the issue of transportation cost.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - It is unusual for a top Nigerian government official to take a meal by the roadside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Col. Muhammed Marwa, the Military Administrator of Lagos state, did just that on Monday. He wanted to prove a point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marwa led a team of officials to stage a public show of eating bean cakes popularly called 'Akara' in Nigeria, to allay growing fears that consumption of the protein-rich food could lead to death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story of the so-called 'killer-beans', which started as a rumour, later spread like wild fire across Nigeria's western states of Oyo, Ogun, Osun and then Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the root of the problem was a press report that armed robbers raided a warehouse in the area and stole a lorry-load of sacks of beans, which had been treated with insecticides for planting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The beans later found their way in local markets, and sold cheaper than normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's vibrant press gave vent to the rumour with numerous catchy headlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, the average Nigerian regarded beans as a choice menu, sought after because of its nutrient-rich properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a leading Nigerian staple, beans can be prepared as a sauce, taken either as a single dish or together with other food items such as plantain, rice, pap (maize cream) or garri (cassava flour soaked in water).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better still, it can be processed and eaten as 'Moi Moi' or fried into cakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such was the culinary variety associated with beans in Africa's most populous nation of some 100 million people, before the controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the stories that fueled the panic were that several members of different families in western Nigeria either fell ill or died after eating bean meals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports had included graphic descriptions of mostly nameless victims and testimonies from generally anonymous witnesses, including medical practitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the harrowing reports said that a woman beans seller in the city of Abeokuta (some 62.5 miles north of Lagos), died after eating some of the grains she prepared, in a bid to convince those who cared to know that her food was safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman was reportedly confronted by an angry mob after several members of a family allegedly died after eating the meal she sold them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rumours took a frightening dimension after several deaths were also reported in Agege, a suburb of Lagos, the country's commercial nerve centre, with some six million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intensity of the rumour was such that not even the assurance by the national agency for food and drug administration could stem the public panic.  &quot;At present, no human being has been produced who took beans and died,&quot; the agency's director-general, Gabriel Osuide, was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, like other health officials, dismissed the rumour as baseless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the public continued to shun beans, causing sellers losses of some 400 million naira (about 50,000 U.S. dollars) in unsold stock of the staple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was at the heat of this controversy that Marwa and his officials took to the Lagos street and made a stop at the stall of an Akara seller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Press photographers had a field day as the military officer and members of his entourage munched away, joined by an army of young men and women who ate up the cakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the public awaits reports of a medical investigation of the beans saga, Marwa has identified the cause of the reported deaths as cholera, traced to a burst water pipe in Agege. The pipe had now been rectified, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, observers say it will take a while before the staple grain returns to its prominent slot on the Nigerian household menu, especially in the western part of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An editorial by Lagos-based privately-owned 'Thisday' newspaper captured the national mood when it said: &quot;It is particularly worrisome that anxious Nigerians have been left in the dark for so long, (thereby) fueling the current panic.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - A Team of five British land experts are in Zimbabwe to identify ways in which the U.K. government can support the country's land re- distribution programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team, that arrived in the country on Monday, will finish its work on Oct. 4, after which it will prepare a report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman of the team, Martin Lowcock, told a press conference on Thursday that their terms of reference, as agreed between the British and Zimbabwean governments, were to assess the possibility of future British aid for land resettlement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team has already spent most of its time visiting model resettlement schemes in Manicaland, Mashonaland West and Mashonaland east provinces of the southern African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also been looking at the farming systems and facilities that exist such as schools and clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lowcock said they had also had meetings with central and local government officials, teachers, health workers and communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been impressed by the clear message we have received, especially from the settlers that their livelihoods now are considerably better than in their previous homes in the communal areas,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This reinforces other evidence, including major evaluation conducted by the British Overseas Development in 1988, that the resettlement programme of the 1980s was a considerable achievement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More detailed discussions with government and other interested parties were still to take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But on the basis of our work so far, we are confident that it should be possible to design a further programme aimed at reducing poverty in rural Zimbabwe through land reform which will justify funding by the British government and other interested donors,&quot; said Lowcock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the mission envisaged a programme including land acquisition, which the British government could help fund on the basis of the willing seller, willing buyer principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The principal objective of the programme would be the reduction of rural poverty. The scale and pace of the implementation would need to reflect the implementation capacity and other constraints faced by the relevant government and other institutions in Zimbabwe,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lowcock said the programme would need to have an acceptable economic rate of return, be cost effective and sustainable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe requires more than five million hectares of land to settle millions of its landless people. The resettlement programme has been moving slowly since Zimbabwe attained independence in 1980 due to lack of funds, resources and manpower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British government and other donors stopped funding the programme when the government abandoned the willing seller, willing buyer scheme and enacted the land acquisition act of 1992 to designate and compulsorily acquire farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only about 60,000 families have been resettled since independence after an initial target of 162,000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal - After months of trying, the World Food Programme of the United Nations said Wednesday it had managed to reach previously inaccessible parts of Liberia's Cape Mount County where possibly thousands of hungry people are struggling to survive in the jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We saw many empty villages,&quot; said the agency's country director for Liberia, Arnt Breivik.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people we saw said that most of the population was hiding in the bush.  They said they had no food, no medicine, nothing at all there.&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breivik's team saw about 1,200 people along the main road running through the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people we saw were in a bad state,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local nongovernmental organisation in the town of Single, a village of about 8,000 people, reported 403 deaths related to malnutrition since April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Food Programme officials estimate that 50,000 people lived in the area previously. Officials said thousands more will come out of hiding once word spreads that relief food had arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency traveled to Cape Mount with a United Nations Inter-Agency team.  They and personnel from nongovernmental organisations entered Cape Mount after months of negociations with rebel factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's last made food deliveries to the area in December 1995. Since then, The county has been vitually cut off from international relief. Only 60 tons of food were airlifted to the country in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. inter-agency team traveled to within 10 miles of the Liberia- Sierra Leone border. Fighters from the ULIMO-J faction told the team to stop because of factional fighting along the road. The Liberian health minister also traveled with the convoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement to PANA in Dakar, the World Food Programme said that clearance would be sought to bring food convoys into the area for direct distribution to the population on Friday. It said it would distribute food directly from food trucks along the main road in the country. The agency said it would, initially, give two-week food rations to the civilian population before assessing longer-term needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency is the largest international food aid organization in the world.  In 1995, it fed at least 50 million people, including half of the world's refugees and internally displaced people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - State prosecutors Thursday closed the Zambian treason case involving six opposition political leaders after hearing testimony from the last state witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director of Public Prosecution, Gregory Phiri, told high court judge Peter Chitengi that the state was closing the case. Defence counsels have decided not to call any witnesses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six members of the opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP), of former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, have been on trial since Aug. 15, on treason and murder charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six, who have been in detention since June 2, have been linked to the clandestine Black Mamba group that has claimed responsibility for recent bomb blasts in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of the accused have been further charged with the murder of a police bomb disposal expert, Ordon Banda. He died June 6 while trying to defuse the bomb allegedly planted by the four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police acting superintendent, Robinson Choka, who arrested the accused, denied in court Thursday that his superior, Crispas Siame, had ordered him to arrest the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siame, who was the head of the investigating team, told the court Wednesday that he had instructed Choka to arrest the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, under cross-examination Thursday by defence lawyer Edgar Lungu, Choka said Siame was lying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Choka insisted that he had made his mind to arrest the accused after sufficient investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence claimed that a senior police officer, who was heading the treason investigating team, was transfered to administration after he advised the police inspector general, in June, that there was insufficient evidence against the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Choka said that he knew that the officer was transfered during the investigations, but said that he did not know why. He failed to tell the court whether or not it was normal to transfer an investigating boss when inquiries were still going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty-three state witnesses have testified during the 16 days that the high court sat to hear evidence. Among the key witnesses who gave the evidence were police inspector general Francis Ndhlovu and Zambia's mines minister, Keli Walubita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State and defence lawyers were to make final submissions later Thursday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana - Shares on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) extended previous session's steep decline Wednesday as the market's blue chips suffered another set-back on their share prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GSE All-Share Index closed mid-week trading 2.77 points lower at 381.54 from Monday's opening figures of 384.31 points, as decliners outnumbered advancers by a margin of four to three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total volume of shares tumbled from the previous closing of 434,900 shares to close at a paltry 15,370 shares.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Share offers, like in previous weeks, were higher than demand at 1,653,500 to 149,250 shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, bids for AGC, FML and MGL, outnumbered offers giving dealers the impression that there might be an upward price change on their share prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total market capitalisation made the third dip in a week, ending at 3,206, 96 billion cedis down from Monday's 3,256.84 billion cedis (One U.S. dollar = 1,696.5 cedis).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the broader market, AGC, MOGL, PZ, and UNIL lost heavily. AGC lost 500 cedis to close at 29,000 cedis. This has been due to the unstable price movements on the London Exchange in recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In London, gold was quoted at 383.25 dollars per ounce barely lower than its 383.30 dollars rate on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOGL and PZ depreciated by 500 cedis and 10 cedis to end trading at 6,500 cedis and 370 cedis, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIL also lost seven cedis at 790 cedis, selling only 1,000 shares out of 21,900 offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advancers were SSB which gained three cedis to end at 1,033 cedis and PTC which went up four cedis to close at 124 cedis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other market gainer was FML which appreciated by a cedi to close trading at 391 cedis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following were the last prices of listed equities at the close of business on Wednesday: ABL, 510 cedis; AGC, 29,000 cedis; CFAO, 22 cedis; EIC,430 cedis; FM, 391 cedis; GCB, 750 cedis; GGL, 243 cedis; HFC, 130 cedis; KBL, 650 cedis; MGL, 130 cedis; MLC, 49 cedis, MOGL, 6,500 cedis; PAF, 154 cedis; PTC, 124 cedis; PZ, 370 cedis; SCB, 5,500 cedis; SPPC, 111 cedis; SSB, 1,033 cedis; UNIL, 790 cedis and UTC - E 60 cedis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BANJUL, Gambia - Gambians began voting Thursday, in crucial presidential polls to end just over two years of military rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Provisional Independent Electoral Commission said some 444,182 registered voters were expected to cast ballots in 582 polling stations across this nation of some 956,600 people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are to choose a president among candidates Sidia Jatta, Ossainou Darboe, Hamat Bah and military ruler Yahya Jammeh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The winner will be decided by a simple majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jammeh, who was recently promoted from army captain to colonel, has ruled this tiny West African nation since toppling President Dawda Jawara on July 22, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jatta is the presidential candidate for the Peoples Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism (PDOIS). Jammeh heads the recently formed Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC). Darboe is the leader of the United Democratic Party (UDP) and Bah heads the National Reconciliation Party (NRP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential frontrunners are widely believed to be Jammeh and Darboe.  Jammeh's government has implemented a number of high profile development projects since the 1994 coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darboe, a lawyer, has defended ranking officials of Jawara's ousted government whom the military regime has charged with corruption. Many former politicians from other parties, including Jawara's banned Peoples Progressive Party, have rallied behind Darboe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign, which began September 9, has been marred by one incident of violence. This was when allegedly anti-Jammeh voters stoned his motorcade Sunday. Three people died and scores were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in a radio address Wednesday, Jammeh appealed to Gambians to vote peacefully.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The State this morning closed the treason case, involving six UNIP leaders among whom is Vice-President Inyambo Yeta, with the last witness testifying on how he decided to effect arrests of the accused persons after consulting other officers and not his superiors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Superintendent - Criminal Investigations Department - Rabison Chooka, 40, of Mess 3, Mazabuka Police Camp, told High Court Judge Peter Chitengi that he made up his mind to arrest the accused after counsultation with Mr.  Crispus Siame, the late Ordon Banda and other officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyer, Edgar Lunga, however, doubted Mr Chooka's claim since Mr.  Siame told the court yestarday that it was him actually who instructed Mr.  Chooka to arrest the accused. Mr. Chooka's earlier statement also agrees with this position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence Counsel, Professor Patrick Mvunga, also quizzed him on how he decided to arrest Rabison Chongo when the statement by Winfred Mwale only mentioned him as being among the many churchmen and students who met at Dr.  Kaunda's home in Kalundu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is meeting at Kalundu treason?&quot; asked Prof Mvunga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is the way I took it when I read the report.&quot; Mr. Chooka replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sebastian Zulu, another defence counsel, also put it to him that a Mr.  Singini, former Senior Assistant Commissioner for Crime, was transfered to a lower rank because he reported to the Inspector-General of Police, Francis Njovu, that the accused had not committed any crime going by the statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chooka replied that he was hearing it for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was adjourned to this afternoon for submissions after the prosecution announced that no more witness would be called, a move that cheered the defence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The European Commission has donated 14 Land-Rovers to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) to revamp the development of sustainable wildlife management in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the official launching of the European development fund financed project on the development of sustainable wildlife management project in Chilanga today, head of EC delegation, Charles Brook said the project would create an opportunity to plan the future of the wildlife department's depleted resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the European Union and its member states were pleased to assist Zambia in one of its largest assets and greatest responsibilities - the wildlife resources, which he said was under the threat of depletion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project launching and donation follows the signing of the financial agreement for an K8 billion programme between Zambia and the European Union three months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of Zambia's largest assets and greatest responsibilities is the country's wildlife resources. We all know the depth of concerns which have frequently been expressed over the depletion of these resources&quot;, Mr Brook said and attributed this to factors like poaching and population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Partly it is poaching, partly population and agricultural encroachment and partly over-exploitation both by hunters and tourism activities. The result will eventually be a virtually lifeless desert of little or no beneffit to the remaining human population or the country as a whole&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officiating at the launching of the project and receiving the vehicles, Tourism Minister, Gabriel Maka said the donation will enhance the effective work programme for the department of NPWS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The donation of the 14 vehicles will go a long way in enhancing the work programme for the department of national parks and wildlife services&quot;, Mr Maka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the project the EU has embarked on was the biggest investment it has made in Zambia in the wildlife resources development and expressed confidence of continued co-operation, saying &quot;I am confident that this is only the beginning of our co-operation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister said five vehicles would be used by management biologists in their research, two for anti-poaching in Kafue and Luame national parks, two by planning co-ordinators, another two by the planning unit, one each by NPWS director, the team leader of the project and the financial adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He advised all users of the vehicles to properly maintain and use them for the purpose for which they were intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A donation of this nature can only be appreciated if we satisfy the donors that the vehicles are used for the purpose for which they were intended. I am sure the donors too expect that the vehicles should run the full span of their expected life&quot;, Mr Maka said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Resident Doctors Association (RDA) has condemned the move to deploy armed police at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RDA also expressed displeasure at the failure of negotiations between the concerned parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is creating undue animosity and is also a major source of apprehension and insecurity for staff and patients,&quot; RDA chairman, Dr Kachinga Sichizya, said yesterday. &quot;Threats and counter threats will not solve the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move has also incensed nurses who were barred from entering the institution yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We shall not allow anyone of us to be intimidated,&quot; a group of nurses found at the UTH entrance shouted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Zambia Nurses Association president, Olive Ng'andu, yesterday blamed the UTH board of management and the government for the on-going strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ng'andu, however, denied earlier reports that she had condemned the strike action by her members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nurses are committed to their professional ethics of caring for the sick but for them to react to such an extent it means they have been pushed far for too long,&quot; Ng'andu said. &quot;But management and the government are too blame for waiting until the situation got out of hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General workers who joined the strike on Tuesday resumed work yesterday as a UTH &quot;crisis committee&quot; headed by acting executive director Dr Tuckson Lambert, met and shortlisted 17 names for questioning and by mid-day had already called six people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UTH public relations officer Don Mwape admitted the situation was still bad but disclosed that the hospital is recruiting part-time nurses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are advertising for part-time nurses and volunteers,&quot; Mwape said. &quot;We are also receiving a lot of help from Maina Soko Military Hospital and from the Red Cross.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - October 31 will mark the end of the MMD govern-ment's mandate and elections have to be held on or before that date, demanded the University of Zambia Students' Union (UNZASU) in a statement released in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNZASU also demanded the immediate announcement of the date for the presidential and general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unfair for others to campaign in disguise while other stakeholders are wallowing in the dark,&quot; read in part a statement signed by UNZASU president Brian Yuyi and publicity secretary Shalala Oliver Sepiso. &quot; Let's have a fair and even road to elections so as to uphold our democratic principles, ideals and morals.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNZASU charged that &quot;it is utterly irresponsible and unfair to misinterpret the laws of Zambia in as far as the term of office of this government is concerned&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is very clear that 31st October will mark five years and elections have to be held on or before that date,&quot; the UNZSU statement further read. &quot;Let's not hide under misinterpreted clauses that give unfair advantage to those already in power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNZASU also condemned the government's insistence that National Registration Cards (NRCs) will not be used for elections when that decision is supposed to be made by an independent Electoral Commission to be set up before this year's polls, as promised by President Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is the preserve of the electoral commission and such sentiments should not be made by interested parties,&quot; UNZASU carped, demanding: &quot;Once the new independent Electoral Commission is put in place, it should be left to work autonomously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNZASU warned that it will use its power and influence to ensure that free and fair elections are held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zambia Democratic Congress(ZDC) general secretary, Derrick Chitala, in an interview yesterday charged that the Electoral Amendment Bill of 1996 the government wants to introduce in Parliament is another law intended at making the electoral body partisan and was not consistent with what was agreed upon in the recent interparty talks with the ruling MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the September 7 meeting we agreed that the commission was going to have seven members. We agreed that three members were going to be nominated by political parties, two nominated by NGOs and the other two from the judiciary,&quot; Chitala said. &quot;But Article four of their Bill says 'the commission shall consist of the following members: a chairperson and not more than four other members, one of whom shall represent the ruling party and another the opposition parties'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitala added: &quot;The article also says the members shall be appointed by the President which makes the whole thing no better than the current situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitala also criticised the Bill for allowing current Electoral Commission members to continue for the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole thing is just the same, all those people who are serving on the current electoral commission will still be there even at the election time,&quot; Chitala said. &quot;According to article 17 of the Bill 'subsequent to other provisions of this Act, a person who immediately before the appointed date, held office as a member of the former commission, shall hold office as a member of the commission for a period'.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) president Dean Mung'omba has also warned that his party will never go into an election knowing very well the electoral system is in a mess - it won't enter the &quot;arena&quot; if the Nikuv mess is not rectified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP publicity secretary, Bweendo Mulengela, at a press briefing in Lusaka yesterday said his party, which has stood against all forms of discrimination and has resolutely supported wars of liberation against racism and apartheid, cannot accept it in Zambia under the diabolical 1996 Constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNIP national council also resolved to support party president Kenneth Kaunda's candidature in the forthcoming presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1996 Constitution is believed to disqualify Kaunda from standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The position is to resolve the current political impasse and not have an intransigent position,&quot; Mulengela said, warning: &quot; President Chiluba and his party will be responsible for the direction the nation takes thereafter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday night that though his party is fully prepared for the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections, they cannot pretend all is well with the Nikuv register when it's in a mess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's football, if you are not comfortable with the referee to go on the pitch,&quot; Mung'omba said. &quot;But we shall do our best to prepare for this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mung'omba, however, feared the election may not legitimate if the MMD government decided to go ahead with it without making sure all stakeholders are happy with the system before polling day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An election can only be legitimate if all the stakeholders are happy, and the process is also legitimate, no one can ligitimatise an election, it has to be all the interested parties,&quot; Mung'omba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if the electoral process is legitimate, ZDC will accept defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every competitor must accept the result, be it a win or loss it is a game,&quot; Mung'omba assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNIP secretary general Sebastian Zulu on Sunday's ZNBC television's Open Forum programme warned that his party will not accept the election results if issues on the electoral process were not ironed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulengela also disclosed that Kaunda will be holding a press conference today at which he will make major party pronouncements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Former &quot;Great&quot; Zamsure players, Kabamba Kala-nde and Vesper Janza, who are currently plying their trade in the port city of Qingdao in China with premier division side Sea Bull FC, are said to be curving out an enviable niche for themselves and clubs there are now cla-mouring to sign on Zambian players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the press attache at the Chinese Embassy in Lusaka, Yang Xiaokun, the duo who have featured in more than ten league games so far, have captured the imagination of the normally conservative Chinese soccer fans and helped push Sea Bull to the summit of the Chinese premier league.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They (the duo) are the key players for Sea Bull football club,&quot; an excited Yang said in an exclusive interview yesterday. &quot;Kalande combines well with Janza and they are definitely the star players of the club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yang also hinted that the duo's contracts, which are scheduled to expire at the end of October, could just be extended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabamba, normally plays as a libero and was regularly a member of the national team winning some caps at last year's All Africa Games in September with the national under-23 side, while Janza is terror on the wings though he is yet to win a call-up to the national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have proved that Zambian players are very good. There is a possibility that their contracts might be re-newed,&quot; Yanga said, adding: &quot;As a matter of fact, alot of Chinese clubs want to recruit Zambian players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yang also reveleaved that the &quot;dynamic duo&quot; have been given an interpreter each &quot;to help them in their day-to-day life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, they have no difficulties on the pitch as you know football is a universal language,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">position of ousting the current United Nations Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, despite him receiving favorable support from some members of the U.N Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters soon after he had a lengthy closed meeting with President Robert Mugabe on Friday, the U.S. Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, George Moose, said the Bill Clinton administration was not going to change its decision to replace Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.N. will have to play a more critical role worldwide and this is going to be more than now, and to do that, it needs a leadership that is not only able to run the organization but to deal with critical issues such as civil strife...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;...it was on that basis that we took that decision (not to endorse his candidature to run for the second term of office),&quot; Moose said. He did not disclose who the U.S. had in mind to replace Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington D.C. is accusing Boutros-Ghali of failing to run the world body effectively and failing to deal with critical issues such as civil strife but observers have taken it to be a racial issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moose said his visit to Zimbabwe was part of an ongoing process between the U.S. and African governments to help African organizations such as the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) maintain peace and stability and to develop the capacity to deal with problems that affect the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to help them develop a capacity to prevent crisis such as the Burundi one and to ensure that they have the ability to deal with the crisis through good response,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South Africa has decided to go ahead with arms sales to the central African state of Rwanda, following last week's visit to the country by Rwandan Vice-President Paul Kagame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the visit, Kagame, who is also the defence minister, met with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Foreign Minister Nzo to discuss the troubled situation in his country and neighbouring Burundi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Conventional Arms Control Committee--which includes several South African cabinet ministers, and was specially formed to handle such matters--met in Pretoria Thursday and decided to give the green light for the sale of what it described as defensive arms to the government of Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee chairman Kader Asmal emphasized that Rwanda's neighbouring states had been consulted on the matter. They had supported the proposal in the belief that it would assist the Rwandan Government to address the security threat it was facing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There had also been consultations with the United Nations. Asmal said the decision by his committee was in line with the United Nations decision to lift the arms embargo against the Rwandan government from the beginning of September--but not the one against non-government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The embargo was introduced in 1994, when a three-month civil war resulted in the massacre of more than half-a-million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest reports indicate that tension has been rising between Rwanda and Zaire, because of the presence of Rwandan Hutus in Zairean refugee camps, and armed bands of Tutsis from Rwanda operating in Zaire. The two groups have been clashing for several weeks in the mountainous northern part of Zaire, near the border with Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - Traditional healers in Zimbabwe are going all out in the fight against the deadly AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 200 traditional medicines have been collected for testing by the Zimbabwe regional drug control laboratory, and 95 percent of them have shown to be useful medicines, says Professor Gordon Chavunduka, president of the Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his annual report, Chavunduka says that a total of 80 HIV-positive patients between 18 and 45 years took traditional medicines administered by four association members over a period of 10 months. The 50,000-member association has 317 branches in 83 districts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chavunduka, these tests showed that some traditional remedies can, in fact, remove or reverse AIDS symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large number of medicines were collected, extracted and analyzed with the assistance of a research institute in the United States, and 10 percent of them showed some protection against the effects of the HIV/AIDS virus on human blood cells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American scientists recommended that some of these traditional remedies be developed further as potential drugs for the treatment of AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pure compounds from some of the plants which had shown to have active principles against AIDS were identified and isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This prompted the association to apply for patent protection in Zimbabwe and also a number of countries since the association now has potential drugs for the treatment of AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is carrying out small pilot studies using these compounds, and patients who are taking them are showing great improvement in the quality of their health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health and child welfare minister Timothy Stamps has praised the work which the association has been doing to fight AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the traditional healers are often the first to be consulted when people have health and other social problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, therefore, important that they receive adequate information about HIV/AIDS so that they may advise their patients correctly, says Stamps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being influential members in their societies, he adds, traditional healers must therefore use their influence and prestige to change people's sexual behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One area they could help, he says, is by re-examining such customs as polygamy and widow inheritance because of the dangers of AIDS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BANJUL, Gambia - The incumbent Gambian president, Yahya Jammeh, is leading in the country's presidential elections held on Thursday, according to provisional results released by the Electoral Commission on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission said Jammeh polled 126,073 votes from 34 of the 45 constituencies, compared to his closest rival, Ossainou Darboe, who obtained 89,833 votes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a panel of poll watchers featured on Gambia radio have expressed surprise at Jammeh's performance, especially in Banjul, where he took 61.84 percent of the vote as against Darboe's 33.95 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panelists did not rule out the possibility of Jammeh, who seized power in a military coup July 22, 1994, winning the highly populated Serekunda east and west, which together with Bakau, have 83,839 registered voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panelists views were influenced by Jammeh's unexpected performance in Bakau, where he received 41.92 percent of the votes in an area where people usually vote against incumbents. Darboe won 54.35 percent of the votes here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jammeh's highest score was in Brikama, his stronghold, where he got 66.33 percent of the votes, compared with 27.72 percent for Darboe. Two other candidates who ran for president won very few votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Full results are expected later Friday, when the candidate who secures a simple majority of all votes cast will be declared the winner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is perhaps one of the supreme ironies that so often mark man's sporting endeavours, that the nub of last weekend's rugby came from the performances of two sides on the wrong end of the final scoreboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For, while Natal held out Transvaal 37-36 to stay top of Section A and Northern Transvaal duly ran out 27-16 winners over Western Province, there was much to be acclaimed and admired in the performances of both losing sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both marked a turning point in application and attitude from teams who have had a tough year of it thus far, sharing disappointing campaigns in the Super 12, battling through almost unprecedented injury lists and struggling to get into gear in the Currie Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Pienaar's Transvaal, the resurgence could not have come at a more critical time with the selection panel's eyes on the coming tours to Argentina and France as the province which provides the nucleus of the Springbok side came good in all but the eventual result.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a stirring fight-back in the second half that was as much a part of the greatness that the game can produce as Andre Joubert's superb hat-trick of tries for Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pienaar led, as he always does, with his body on the line and, aided by a truly monster game from the giant Kobus Wiese, the Transvaal pack finally produced the fire they are capable of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fritz van Heerden's Province side too were far from disgraced against a Northerns side which has re-established the winning pattern of simplicity before spread that the late Buurman van Zyl turned into such an artform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true that while there will always have to be winners, the true mark of the health of rugby in this country is the gap between the eventual scorelines. In these two instances at least, this was true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while there must be cause for some relief at the South African Rugby Football Union's offices over these two results, there must equally be some concern over the monster 113-11 win Free State recorded over a hapless South Western Districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the former encounters, there lay all that is good in the Currie Cup system - hard, committed play, skill, flair and adventure - in the latter all that is inherently unbalanced in the present set-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the fact that Free State missed the Super 12 is taken into account, the new-look boys from Bloem have managed to do in their own backyard what has evaded Transvaal and Western Province on a more global platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there will have to be a hard look at the ethos professionalism has introduced to the remnants of a system that must, by its very nature, leave sides like South Western Districts as whipping boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To produce a combination capable of consistently taking on the bigger unions, there has to be a better and more equitable spread of resources. It is impossible for the men from Oudtshoorn to be expected to match the megabucks at Ellis Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One would suspect that, in the age of the electronic spectator, the idea that the late Doc Craven fought so hard for - that of getting the big name sides and players to the lesser-known venues - no longer really holds water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is all very well holding the local side dear to one's heart, but laying out good money to watch yet another weekend whipping, when the beer at home is cold, the couch comfortable and the confrontation on offer more appealing, has proved to be another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be a sad day if these representative sides were to disappear altogether. They have every much a right to pride and tradition - and it might be added playing Free State -as any other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Sarfu should examine more closely the system which has kept American football competitive in a professional era; one where the teams are traded and sold as franchises rather than regional fixtures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Americans rely on a draft system to smooth out imbalances. This allows for the team which finishes last to have first choice of the new players coming through or even to barter that choice for another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this way, the lesser sides are able to build whatever strengths they own by filling in the gaps in their make-ups with real talent. The players are able to command big money on their way into the game and free to move on when the initial contract has been fulfilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a South African rugby-playing context, the major centres - with major budgets - are already able to do this, slotting in players almost at will, given the incentives they can offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A draft system would, however, enable more and more young players to find their way into the Currie Cup competition. Those who make it able to move to the bigger, better- paying unions, those who don't, welcome to finish their careers in the lesser sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it will certainly go some way towards producing the kind of performances from losing sides evident last weekend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It had to happen at some point. With so many commissions doing the rounds in the new South Africa at the moment, it was only a matter of time before the soccer world had its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pickard Commission into irregularities in soccer administration has been around for the past few months, but things are only starting to hot up now, as the main players start to flex their muscles. Judging by the way matters are developing at the moment it is clear that the gloves are off as South Africa's soccer administrators battle for supremecy, and already mud is starting to fly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings of the commission, which was instituted by Minister of Sport and Recreation Steve Tshwete, are to be presented to President Nelson Mandela, and it is sure to change the face of soccer in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the one side there is the South African Football Association (Safa) led by its executive president Solomon &quot;Stix&quot; Morewa, and supported by his childhood friend, Kaizer Chiefs boss Kaizer Motaung. A man never keen to shy away from publicity, Morewa has been out of the public eye for longer than he would like - since the country won the Nations Cup in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side of the &quot;struggle&quot; is the National Soccer League (NSL) from whom Morewa is receiving opposition in a more collective form, with Jomo Sono, managing director of Jomo Cosmos, and Irvin Khoza, head of Orlando Pirates, at the helm. They are backed by, among others, Veli Mahlangu, Raymond Hack and Sundowns &quot;Iron Lady&quot; Nastasia Tschiclas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amazing twist in the story is that the two organisations share offices at the FNB Stadium, home of South African soccer, and the officials at loggerheads basically have to pass each other on a daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In soccer circles over the years it has been common knowledge that a &quot;cold war&quot; exists between certain officials, but it has always been a matter to which everybody, including the media, has been quite conveniently turning a blind eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, it has become part of the game in a country where more is seen and heard of the exploits of the officials running the game than the people who actually make the sport, the players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the current centre of the storm is Safa's marketing wing, Awesome Sport International (ASI), to which Morewa's organisation has been accused of selling its biggest asset - football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASI's managing director Brian Mahon has yet to appear before the commission and has for some reason not been forthcoming despite numerous appeals by commission chairman Judge Benjamin &quot;Bobby&quot; Pickard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, evidence has mainly been heard on the misuse of the Safa trust fund, which was supposed to benefit players but has, as Pickard put it, &quot;been benefiting the employees of Safa and their families&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those who received money from the trust fund are Kaizer Chiefs football club, which received R10 000, Morewa himself, who was awarded a R3 000 bursary to, as Safa's vice-president Molefi Olifant put it, &quot;do a diploma&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A journalist also received R1 500 from the fund, something which interested Pickard who said that the reason he was so keen to learn more about this particular matter was that he had heard allegations of journalists &quot;being bought&quot; to ensure favourable publicity for certain soccer officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearings resumed again on Thursday after a break of a week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - With no Premier League fixtures scheduled for this weekend, all attention will be focused on the Coca-Cola Cup, formerly known as the JPS Cup, which reaches the semi-final stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of the four sides that have reached this stage of the competition, two - QwaQwa Stars (1994) and Bush Bucks (1993) - have already won the trophy, and both have home ground advantage against their opponents this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stars host Sundowns on Saturday and Bucks, conquerors of Orlando Pirates in the previous round, host Supersport United, who did the job against Kaizer Chiefs in the previous round to earn their place in the last four. Supersport are attempting to win their first trophy since being taken over by pay channel M-Net's sports wing, Supersport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a bit of an up-and-down season for Mike Mokoena's men from Qwa Qwa, who slumped badly after a good start to the 1996 campaign - they reached the final of the BP Top 8 competition, which they lost to Orlando Pirates.  Since then, their form took a major and inexplicable slump, which fortunately seems to be over now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They should start Saturday's game against the Brazilians as favourites.  Stars have beaten Sundowns twice so far this season, 4-0 in the BP Top 8 semifinal, and then 2-1 in the Coke Challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both those victories were in the pre-Reinhard Fabisch days, and the German coach seems to have instilled a new sense of motivation and confidence in the players who have been shoved around quite a bit this season. In the previous round they needed a penalty shoot-out to oust Jomo Cosmos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sundowns are also the only &quot;big name&quot; club still left in this competition which has a history of tilting the balance toward the smaller guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stars advanced to the semi-finals without scoring a goal in the previous round, they left that to their opponents, Wits, who scored three times, but still lost the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They beat them 2-1, with the Students scoring all the goals on the night, defenders Gordon Ewen and Kevin Rafferty suffering the embarrassment of putting the ball into their own net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stars coach Peter Nyama will obviously miss the skills of Zairean forward Emeka Mamale, who has embarked on a new career in the Far East, this after going Awol a few months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Stars, holding the player's clearance, appealed to Fifa and the Korean club where Mamale was on trial was forced to pay Stars a substantial amount - said to be more than a R1-million - for the player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have in the past had the ability to aquire players that the bigger clubs seem to miss, a perfect example being another Zairean Bunene Ngaduane who led Stars to the 1994 Coke Cup title. Realising the ability of Stars managing director Mokoena to unearth these gems, other clubs did the next best thing, they waited at the airport and poached the players en route to the Free State! So these days, Bra Mike waits for his players at the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supersport United face the daunting task of travelling to Umtata to face a resurgent Bush Bucks side on their cabbage patch pitch at the Independence Stadium in front of around 30 000 partisian home fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little doubt that Supersport MD Terry Paine is not relishing the trip, despite the fact that the last time these two sides met it was Supersport that ran out 4-0 winners at the Odi Stadium. The Pretoria-based side has improved leaps and bounds under their new owners, and has exceeded even their expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next few years United will undoubtedly become a force in African soccer judging by the way the club is run and the professional way players are treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bucks beat Orlando Pirates on penalties in the previous round and were quite outstanding in doing so, despite the fact that it was a tired Pirates that opposed them on the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although they start the game as favourites, the last time they played a semi-final game at that venue, in the BP Top 8 Cup, they were beaten by Pirates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is a tough enough task which faces the national cricket team this summer, and the news that skipper Hansie Cronje starts the international season less than fully fit makes that task even tougher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thankfully, Cronje's injury is nothing more serious than a strained ligament in his left hand, but it does raise the thought that the South African cricket side has relied as heavily on Cronje's presence as on his cerebral yet joyous brand of captaincy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to believe that Cronje has only just turned 27, so great has his on-and-off- field maturity showed itself to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been noted more than once over the past few seasons of this country's journey back from the Outer Hebrides of the days of isolation that the national side has always leaned firmly on guts and determination. And while there can be no question that the South Africans will always be a difficult team to beat, it is as a team that they have played the game rather than as an assembly of individual stars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One would tend to question parts of that assumption. We have, in many areas of the game, individuals to match if not better the names the rest of the world can offer. But in one area the argument remains a very valid one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have, in analysis, continued to provide the unassailable truth that cricket, imbued though it may be with a vast array of skill essential to playing the game at top level, remains a team effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this respect, we have been extremely lucky in being able to call on the experience of first Clive Rice, then Kepler Wessels and now Cronje.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice, one still feels, got a raw deal after leading the team out of isolation. But it was Wessels, regardless of what his critics continue to say, who single-mindedly drove the side to new heights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, he had a dour and unspectacular captaincy style. But you cannot deny his fighting abilities. Or, for that matter, the spirit and self-belief he hammered into a group of players, many of whom had never been further north than Centurion Park or further east than St George's Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with him went Cronje, captain of Free State at 21 and learning from Wessels every step of the way. He embraced all that was good in his mentor ...  and then grafted on to that a youthful exuberance and sheer inner feeling for the game that marked him as something special when the mantle of leadership passed to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What all that leads up to is the fact that, while we have a wealth of young talent just bursting to come through, there is no one at present ready to take over the reins from Cronje at the helm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Matthews is the vice-captain and a vastly experienced skipper at provincial level, and only the foolish would begin to believe that he has no capabilities as a skipper. But there is the nagging thought that, as one of the veterans of the team, the opportunity leading to the happy circumstance which elevated Cronje to the hot-seat so young is not evident in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doubtless Matthews will be the man to lead the South Africans in the &quot;one or two games&quot; Ali Bacher is confident is all Cronje will have to sit out on the tour to Kenya which starts with the hosts playing would champions Sri Lanka in Nairobi this Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that Matthews will lead the side onto the field against Pakistan on Sunday and probably once again against Sri Lanka next Tuesday, without any shadow of doubt, the two toughest games in the quadrangular tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Cronje's problems persist, there is also the looming spectre of a gruelling tour to the Indian sub-continent which follows just a week after the end of the Kenyan safari on October 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This starts with an unenviable round of six one-day internationals in a triangular series involving India and Australia, with the possibility of a seventh should the side make the final on November 6. And then straight into a three-test series against the Indians, with matches at Ahemadebad(check??), Calcutta and Kanpur to think about with only a week's break before the Indians arrive in this country for a mirror image series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, given a glance at this arduous schedule, some room for fervent prayer that Cronje's injury is as slight as the authorities say it is. We need him as a player... and even more so as a captain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - MICHAEL LAPSLEY - PRIEST AND PARTISAN: A SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNEY by Michael Worsnip (Ocean Press, R69,99)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conventional boundaries between the genres of political and religious biography take something of a tumble in this generally excellent new book by theologian and church historian Michael Worsnip. His subject is Father Michael Lapsley, priest of the Society of the Sacred Mission, an Anglican religious order. Lapsley is also a member of the African National Congress (ANC) and one of a few survivors of a death-squad assassination attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New Zealander by birth, Lapsley came to South Africa as a young monk in the early 1970s,was soon elected national chaplain to Anglican university students, was exposed to the harsh apartheid realities of the times and, although still a committed pacifist (as a schoolboy even refusing to do cadets!), was deported from South Africa after the 1976 students' uprising.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving to Lesotho, he worked among university students in Roma (including young South African exiles) and with Anglican ordinands. He also joined the ANC, having come to the conclusion that pacifism in South Africa did not work.  His work as spokesperson for the ANC became a source of tension for his church and religious order, and he was eventually moved from Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After much discussion, often heated, he was allowed to move to the recently independent Zimbabwe, where he tried to combine pastoral ministry, graduate studies and ANC work. Controversy followed him - a dispute with the then bishop (Peter Hatendi) and his sharply critical account of Anglican &quot; neutrality&quot; under the Ian Smith regime made him unpopular in some circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He worked for the ANC mission and the Lutheran World Federation in Zimbabwe until 1990 when, on April 28, a bomb concealed in a magazine sent to him by an alleged comrade blew off both his hands and blinded him in the right eye.  He recovered, returning to South Africa to work in Cape Town with the blessing of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who in early 1990 had strongly supported the Anglican synod's decision not to allow priests to be members of political parties. Lapsley currently works as the chaplain to the trauma centre at Cowley House in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the framework of such a life, Lapsley's biographer weaves a fascinating and moving account of what it meant to be a Christian priest within a liberation movement. Since Worsnip himself was for a while an exile in Lesotho, where he secretly joined the ANC and was later also ordained an Anglican priest, and is a good friend of Lapsley, one might describe the author's approach to his subject in the anthropological terminology of a &quot; participant observer&quot;. This common ground both gives the book its depth and perhaps explains some of its weaknesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worsnip has a clear, and partisan, view of church politics. He has no doubts as to the inevitable and even natural links between religion and politics. He and his subject share the same broad theological and political positions: both are adherents of the theology of liberation, which asserts that Christians should take the side of the poor and oppressed and work for a just, more equal distribution of power and wealth in human society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, they see the local church as a basic unit of the religious community, whose interests should take precedence over the hierarchical structures of the church if a conflict of interests arises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reviewer would share this opinion,but the problem is that Worsnip perhaps takes it for granted that his readers both understand these presuppositions and/or endorse them. From his tone, it is clear Worsnip is also trying to advocate such a position in the course of his biographical narrative. It is a pity that he doesn't state his case more overtly.  This is but one broad example of an instance where advocacy (and I do believe that Worsnip is advocating a theological- political position throughout) is weakly handled. Other issues that deserved attention include the Christian &quot;just war&quot; tradition and the question of a priest's partisan political alignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternatively, Worsnip's position vis-a-vis Lapsley also gives us helpful insights into Lapsley's personality and ultimately his faith. Worsnip manages to represent the realities and difficulties of being a monk today in a way a secular biographer might find difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nature of religious life, with its paradoxical - and to some people slightly weird - vows of poverty,chastity and obedience, is presented realistically. A vowed monk or nun is not (or at least shouldn't be) a kind of &quot;otherworldly superbeing&quot; or even the comic parody of popular media, but a real person, with weaknesses and fears and strengths like the rest of humanity. This certainly is the picture one gets of Michael Lapsley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious readers may also pick up from this book the elements of a spirituality, a way of living out a faith commitment. It is one which articulates a &quot;service of faith and promotion of justice&quot; (to borrow the terms of a 1975 document of the Roman Catholic Jesuit order) and, highly relevant to South Africa today, one that focuses on notions of repentance, truth and reconciliation. Amid much pie-in-the-sky dross that often gets presented as spirituality, this will be truly refreshing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much more could be said about Michael Lapsley -Priest and Partisan. More needed to be said about Lapsley - perhaps an autobiography is still in order.  Despite its weaknesses, Worsnip has written a really engaging, readable and at times deeply provocative book that deserves a wide readership beyond the &quot; politico&quot; and &quot;religious&quot; circles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - I did a double take when I watched the first episode of Homeland, the SABC3 drama series: there on screen, prime time SABC, was a relatively graphic depiction of a drunken white man raping a black woman.  Here seemed to be a groundbreaking series that was going to force us, as a nation, to confront our past in all its ugliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This view still remains, but I am no longer sure how the makers have stayed true to exposing us as we truly are. By the end of that episode I was of the opinion that maybe this is all just about the rehabilitation of our image.  This rehabilitation seems to say that most white people in this country never complied with the apartheid machinery, that we were all merely victims of an outside system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I feel awkward about the three main characters - the people whose experiences one identifies with throughout the series. These three are a government of national unity: one white English-speaking lad who ends up within the the murderous bosom of the SADF, one Afrikaans lad who discovers the power of the pen in the just war of human rights, and, the final member of our nightmare trio, one black lad whose lot leads him to the training camps from whence he will try to right all the wrongs of our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In essence there is nothing wrong with this depiction, as each member neatly represents a sector of our society. It's just that it's precisely the neatness of it all that makes it awkward for me. It's the kind of neatness that makes the character who ends up in the SADF appear to be an essentially nice guy who somehow got caught up in the madness. He is the one that defends the black protagonist from the abuses of other whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Afrikaans activist is perhaps the most profound of the lot - maybe the makers felt that in real life the Afrikaner is the one most in need of rehabilitation. From his mouth pearls of wisdom flow: &quot;If you treat somebody differently because of the colour of the skin, God will punish your soul.&quot; This is directed at a racist uncle who is treating the black friend with contempt. And when he is sent to bed without supper, he replies: &quot;Even if I never have another meal in my life, at least my soul won't go hungry.&quot; Too neat. Too clean. Too profound. Coming from the mouth of this babe, the words are way too wise.  Even the black character is just too perfect. He discovers The Communist Manifesto at the age of 10 and devours it voraciously. It must take some ability to be able to decipher, at that age, what surely ranks as some of the most turgid writing in history - especially in your second language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe I'm being petty, but I found the cliched character a bit too much to stomach. He finally decides that he is going to leave the country - at age 10 - and here the makers of the series could not resist sprinkling it with a dash of Hollywood as the three children meet for the last time and say their goodbyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surprising thing - perhaps it is showing the ironic contradictions of life, but I doubt it - is that the child who ends up being a state terrorist is the one who is most distraught at the departure of his black friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We watch as the camera pulls back to reveal a look of frustration on his face, his voice echoing through the woods as he screams his friend's name. A significant part of me is hoping that 10 episodes on I am not going to be confronted by the character explaining that he got involved in cross border raids because the childhood trauma of losing his friend left him permanently damaged.  While the script does work at times, what I find most problematic is that it seems embarrassed to show us who and what we really are. Instead of saying that it represents a particular, subjective perspective - a liberal view in the nicest sense of the word - it bills itself as the whole truth, the only truth and nothing but the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the thing is that there are as many different truths out there as there are people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Do not despair. There is life after Hugh Masekela. Jazz festival organisers who still chase after the same great veteran names for their bills should be looking hard at the new talent waiting in the wings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gloria Bosman stretched her glorious vocal wings at Grahamstown; Busi Mhlongo astounded Germany recently and now Jimmy Dludlu's C-Base Collective (opening act for Courtney Pine) follows suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dludlu's guitar skills produce solos which incorporate the strident syncopation of the Shangaan beat alongside more conventional jazz styles.  He's a technical wizard and he's finding his own voice. Watch him fly now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His band is also remarkable for its consideration to performance as well as playing and its music relates much more directly to the players' ages than to their social origins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A case in point is trumpeter Marcus Wyatt. His solos have the conservatism of youth; he doesn't take too many risks. But he knows where the music's coming from. A hornman to watch. Hard not to watch is trumpeter Johnny Mekoa - not only for his acute craftsmanship, but for the team of young musical monsters he's raising in Daveyton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gauteng Jazz Academy Band got an outing on Saturday, sharing a Pretoria stage with Japanese jazz ensemble East of the Sun. Led by pianist Kuni Mikami, the visitors presented an appealing set which leant heavily on jazz arrangements of traditional melodies. Mikami is a very Ellingtonian pianist with a strong percussive left hand, while flautist Yoshino provides elegant, rounded flute solos. The group's strongest feature was the perfect teamwork between Mikami and drummer Chihiro Matsumoto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Johnny and co came on, after a curiously moving statement from Mikami that working with them had &quot;changed my world ...&quot;. Mekoa broke all our hearts on a gorgeously-timed Lakutshon'Ilanga, and then both ensembles broke all constraints with a thoroughly swinging Bag's Groove.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It's the Wednesday before his first Johannesburg concert and Courtney Pine shivers beside a wall outside the Parktonian Hotel as rain clouds loom. &quot;The guys all brought shorts and stuff. Is the weather real?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courtney Pine ambles out from side-stage at Mega Music, casually blowing soprano sax, about halfway through the first 32 bars of Garden of Eden.  Clearly, plenty of people know the track, because the place is howling and hot. He diverts into Bob Marley's One Love, gets us all chorusing, then takes off into the abstractions of his own Prince of Peace, roaring round big abstract chords like 'Trane in Live in Seattle, but never for one instant ceasing to swing.  &quot;When we started playing, the music press couldn't see where we were coming from; couldn't see the connection between reggae and jazz. But it's the spirit that's important, not the label. Jazz isn't tied to any particular culture. An Eskimo could play it; an Aborigine could play it.  The culture's nothing like as important as the conversation that's established between us when we play.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince of Peace lets Pine demonstrate the first of the evening's astounding stretches of circular breathing. The neck tautens and swells, the eyes pop, and the note just keeps on coming. Later on, he retreats to the edge of the stage and punctuates Cameron Pierre's guitar solo with staccato blasts from two horns at once. The reference point this time is not 'Trane but Roland Kirk, whose fondness for multi-instrumental pyrotechnics and jazz-takes on contemporary pop also led some tight-assed critics to undervalue the talent and respect for jazz tradition which underpinned it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My generation has soaked up all the influences - the music our parents brought with them from the Caribbean; the pop music we heard; sound system culture; dancehall and the jazz legacy of Americans like Sonny Rollins and great West Indians like Joe Harriott. In the Eighties, we started looking for an opportunity to give musical expression to all of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bringing turntables to the front of the music pre-dates hip-hop. It belongs to dancehall culture and the talent young DJs applied to modest home hi-fis at Brixton rent parties. They'd &quot;spice up&quot; a track with vocal commentary, needle scratches, anything to extend the limited range of the record- player.  Now Pine is duetting with DJ Pogo on Absolution, getting into a positive cutting contest. As Pogo takes off into an extended improvisation, you realise Pine is also vindicating the turntable as a jazz performance instrument; maybe the first really new one since Adolphe Sax invented his little toy. Other elements are more traditional, like Pierre's full lyrical guitar solos, which would fit in nicely anywhere from Fletcher Henderson's band to the Skatalites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After ten years of working with conventional jazz forms, I wanted to reflect the music of my generation, which is jazz for dancing. You could say I'm using scratching as a form of percussion - although it goes somewhere very different in terms of tuning and rhythm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pine's stage act owes a lot to his apprenticeship in reggae bands playing hard and sometimes rough audiences. He works us, smooths us into his backing singers, gets us dancing - then slams a wild free jazz solo at us while we're still too charmed to worry. The act also owes a lot to older British traditions like music hall and panto. He tries to get us into a Mother Goose routine: &quot;The band's going away now ... But they're coming back ... Oh, no they're not...&quot; The South African audience, used to more conformist models of participation, dutifully echoes &quot;Oh, no they're not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me, coming to Africa is the end of a ten-year pilgrimage. If I'm bringing anything here at all, it's the message that something new and different can be done. The sounds of our generation are a completely valid part of jazz.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know,&quot; says one photographer afterwards, &quot;I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure about all that hip-hop stuff, for a jazz concert ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wasn't it a wonderful show?&quot; says the tenor sax player from Johnny Mekoa's Jazz Academy Band, at least ten years younger than the photographer. &quot;He's the best jazzman I've heard live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you realise,&quot; says bari sax player Vee Sabono, &quot;that he actually got a South African audience singing in tune, in a three-part harmony?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I'd like to share, is my belief in creation,&quot; Pine maintains.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the city of gold looks forward to Baba Maal's concerts, our critic considers other recent shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was picked up from the airport in a limo, because that's what he requested. And he's over half an hour late for the interview. In fairness, his flight was delayed by three hours. He walks into the room in a regal purple mandarin jacket, the sleeves rolled back to reveal gold lining, his crop cut hair tinted blonde on top.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is, in short, an important man back home - a point underscored by a representative of the Senegalese press who fusses around him: we must understand this a short interview, he says, because Mr Maal is tired. After about 15 minutes he moves Baba Maal off the coffee table the photographer had chosen because it's &quot;not at all comfortable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maal has recorded four albums on the Mango/Island label, and five before that. His most recent, and best known internationally, are Lam Toro and Firin' In Fouta, both of which earned him rave reviews - as do his live concerts (12 people on stage, including two dancers, talking drum, kora, two saxes and loads of percussion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in northern Senegal, and &quot;approaching 40&quot;, he is profoundly attached to his Toucouleur heritage, but at the same time he's progressive, a reformer who speaks English as well as French. &quot;I've fought the caste system at home,&quot; he explains, &quot;like the griot thing. In my society you're born into the griot line and you only make music if that is your heritage.&quot; Griots not only have a hereditary calling, they're also society's commentators, critics, praise singers, keepers of oral history and settlers of disputes. So, strictly speaking, he has no traditional right to make music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Maal, the son of a musical mother - who sang traditional songs and wrote her own music and a muezzin - a prayer leader, rebelled and chose a musical career while he was studying law, moving on to study music at the conservatoire in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was especially difficult for me as I had not only graduated from school but was studying at university. People just couldn't understand - particularly as musicians had such a hard time making a living.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The music of his tradition is called yela and you can quite clearly hear it's an ancient form. &quot;It came from the (medieval) empire of Ghana, north up to Senegal,&quot; he says. Part of Maal's skill is in combining the music with modern elements, without sacrificing the source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are good things and bad things in tradition,&quot; says Maal, who takes his role as musician and messenger very seriously. In Senegal, he is seen as an intellectual and a progressive ready to question values he feels hold the country back. He is, in fact, an honorary griot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Senegal people will not excuse me if I sing a song and it does not say anything; because I've had the opportunity to study and travel and they haven't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm an African, I belong to a universal civilisation, and I grew up in music even though I'm not a griot. I know I have a responsibility to help society to take choices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the issues he raises is female circumcision. &quot;It's not a good practice.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe - The biggest grossing films in Zimbabwe this year are Waiting to Exhale and Showgirls. Sign of the times: Hollywood is still dominating world movie production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Southern Africa Film Festival, Post and Telecommunications Minister Joyce Mujuru urged representatives to reduce dependence on foreign films. &quot;Look more to the sub-region and exchange whatever quality films there are,&quot; she appealed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In line with its theme, Cinema for Regional Integration, the festival is showcasing new films from the region. These include the premi&quot;res of two new Zimbabwean films, I Am the Future and Everbody's Child. Both deal with the plight of children and are funded by development agencies. There's also a healthy selection of documentaries and shorts including the avant garde-ish Passion Play which was made for Z$8-million, and several South African features including If Truth Be Told, A Day With the President and Broken String. The event also serves as a showcase for previous winners at Fespaco, Africa's premier film festival and a major retrospective of Burkinab director Idrissa Ouedraogo's work, which coincides with the Harare-based shoot of his first Anglophone film, Through the Day. Other curiosities include the first Zambian feature in 14 years, Redflower, and a delightful short entitled A Lucy from Mauritius. The Americans are present in the form of two independent features, Naked Acts - a witty, sensual and incisive picture about an actress obsessed with her body and Follow Me Home - a quirky road movie complete with red indians and the cavalry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally designed as a biennial event, the festival suffered administrative problems and was delayed for a year. South African delegates were banned in 1993, but some independents managed to attend as observers.  This year too, the festival faced funding problems. Initially budgeted at Z$4, 5- million, there was a major hiccup when the European Union (EU), the major donor, withdrew. Rumours have it the reason was bad management and corruption.  Then other funding bodies threatened to follow the EU lead. Isaac Meli Mabhiwa, the festival director, is philosophical: &quot;When the big guy sneezes, everybody catches flu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he managed to placate panicking funders and the budget was scaled down to Z$1,2- million. For the moment the 1996 festival appears to be a rousing success and it seems possible that the festival will be able to attract the financial support it needs. Officials have established a permanent office in Harare (funded by Dutch agency Hivos, which has committed support until the end of 1997), and it's hoped that this office will become the hub of a support network for film-making projects. Already, delegates from across the sub-continent are attending financing workshops, organised by enterprising local production company, Framework International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At night, the jacaranda-festooned Harare avenues buzz with filmmakers off to cocktail parties. Here one bumps into the producer of the regrettable South African flop Soweto Green, Toron's Carl Fischer. Or one can rub shoulders with the likes of Cheik Omar Sissoko of Mali - maker of the exquisite, folkloric Guimba the Tyrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although attendance at the screenings is a trifle disappointing (locals still prefer catching Mission Impossible and Bad Boys), the raison d'etre of the festival seems to be gelling. The mission here is to promote co-operation in the production, distribution and exhibition of African films in the region; improve links between film-makers in the Southern and Eastern African area with those elsewhere in Africa, and help create sustainable film production in the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - We live in a solar-powered world, yet nearly two-and-a-half billion people are desperately short of energy with which to improve their existence. There are two energy crises: the one we know about, in which 21% of the world's population guzzles 70% of the world's commercial energy output, mostly in the form of pollution-causing fossil fuels. The other energy crisis is barely perceived, and the proceedings of the United Nations World Solar Summit, which grappled with it over two days last week, have barely been reported. It is the crisis in which 40% of the world's population still live at a basic subsistence level without any form of electricity. This is just as big a challenge as tackling the new world food shortage or the greenhouse effect - and is linked to both of them too.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting the energy deficit for the poor 40% of the world by conventional means is vastly expensive and will only add to pollution. Nuclear power is prohibitive for a poor country and we are now well aware of its hidden costs.  To provide fossil fuels to this huge clientele would run down resources and increase environmental damage: poor countries cannot afford the pollution- reducing frills of the developed world. The use of wood and charcoal has already devastated forests, but can only be slowed down if there is an affordable substitute. The most obvious resource is the enormously powerful one above our heads, and the related renewable sources of wind and tide. Yet investment in renewable energy research is marginal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of heads of state and government attending the World Solar Summit in Harare was a roll-call of deprivation. The United States, Britain, Germany and other Western nations were only represented by diplomats based in Africa, although China and India sent ministers. The conference suffered from being organised by Unesco, against which the US has been waging a vendetta. Except for the high-profile Rio Conference, most international environmental campaigns fail to be noticed, and then fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Harare Summit has identified 300 projects already under way in 60 countries which need support. Funding for renewable energy technologies takes up only 3% of lending by the World Bank and other multilateral banks. Yet the value of the emerging worldwide market for these technologies, if it were encouraged to develop, could reach $40-billion a year. Small is beautiful, but it can be complex and expensive. Unesco's new vision needs new cash as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zanzibar - For more than 200 years, giant Aldabra tortoises have thrived on Prison Island, a small coral atoll just off the coast of Zanzibar that was once used as a detention centre for disobedient slaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When explorer David Livingstone established his expedition headquarters in Zanzibar in 1866, he may well have dined on the fleshy meat of the reptiles that were brought to Prison Island by sailors arriving in East Africa from the Seychelles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tortoise meat may no longer be on the menus of tourist restaurants in Zanzibar's ancient stone town, but the reptiles are facing extinction because they are prized by owners of exotic pets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illegal traders, who have been paying Zanzibaris to steal the tortoises from Prison Island, sell them in the Middle East and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It won't be long before there are no breeding tortoises left on Prison Island, and in a number of years there'll be no tortoises at all,&quot; says Mike Pugh of the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA). &quot;The Zanzibaris will have lost a creature that is an asset to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just four years ago, there were 50 adult Aldabra tortoises on Prison Island.  Some weighed more than 150kg and were estimated to be more than a century old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, only nine remain. They still breed, but their young are often stolen just weeks after hatching. More than 100 baby tortoises recently disappeared from an open enclosure, amid allegations that local officials were involved in their illegal export to the United Arab Emirates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tortoises can fetch up to the equivalent of more than R1 000 each, if sold to illegal traders - more than the average Zanzibari earns in a year.  But the real profit is made by the traders who sell the tortoises on for thousands of rands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WSPA has launched a campaign to raise awareness among Zanzibaris about the threat of extinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meredith Kennedy, an American veterinary surgeon who is helping the campaign, says: &quot;A lot of people here are living on the edge. It's a subsistence economy and most people have to worry about getting their children fed. We want to highlight what's going on, but we won't ever be able to make saving tortoises the priority of everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 80 young tortoises have now been moved to more secure surroundings behind Livingstone House, the headquarters of the Zanzibar Tourist Corporation. All have been numbered, and it is hoped that microchips will be inserted under their skin so that they could be traced quickly if stolen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tripoli - When the artificial &quot;great river&quot;, which is fed by fossil water extracted from the depths of the Libyan desert, was inaugurated earlier this month with all the lavish trappings of a Hollywood spectacular, it gushed out of the city's antiquated conduits and flooded the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that was going on, Colonel Moammar Gadaffi, in a marathon speech of the kind he gives every year when commemorating the 1969 revolution, spelled out measures to avert an evil which, he said, was threatening to swamp Libyan society: money made from corruption and speculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gadaffi hinted at what was to come in May, when he set up 80 &quot;purge committees&quot; to remodel Libya's economy, then suffering from galloping inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, in Tripoli's uppercrust districts, there have been widescale shutdowns of stores that used to overflow with exorbitantly priced Western goods - and which contrasted unflatteringly with state co-operatives that stocked only a few subsidised staples.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following an advertising campaign encouraging Libyans to inform on each other, the news filtered out that several VIPs had been placed under house arrest in the suburbs of Tripoli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, travellers arriving in Egypt from Libya revealed that there had been a swoop on more than 1 000 shopkeepers in Libya's second- largest city, Benghazi, and that their stores had been closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his commemoration speech, Gadaffi said he was delighted with the diligence of the purge committees. They consist chiefly of young soldiers, to whom he has virtually given carte blanche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shopkeepers are not the only section of the population that has suffered from Gadaffi's change of policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Arab daily, Al Sharq al Awsat, at least one colonel and several dozen senior civil servants have also run into trouble with the committees. The campaign has had repercussions in all parts of the economy, including the vital oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western diplomats in Tripoli believe there are ulterior political motives behind the current drive on the economic front. Gadaffi has taken advantage of his crackdown on speculation, which he himself allowed to flourish after introducing a policy of economic openness in the early Nineties, to get rid of a few political figures who could eventually prove a threat to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after 27 years, the wear and tear of being in power is beginning to show. This was evident from the lukewarm reception spectators gave the military parade organised in Tripoli for the anniversary of the revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another, more serious sign that the Gadaffi regime is running out of steam is the guerrilla movement that has established itself since March in the mountains near the town of Derna, east of Benghazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government never goes so far as to suggest it is running into difficulties,&quot; notes an observer. &quot;Yet it did precisely that in a recent communiqu announcing it had carried out land and air manoeuvres using 'live ammunition'. This was an attempt to justify bombing raids in March and August that were unlikely to have gone unnoticed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he is facing more resistance than he is used to, Gadaffi still rules Libya with an iron fist. &quot;There is no evidence to corroborate the claim by the flood of communiqus the government has sent to London-based Arab newspapers that disorders in Benghazi are the result of an Islamist upsurge,&quot; says a diplomat. &quot;Although such groups may exist, their effectiveness is probably limited and, more importantly, the Islamic opposition in Benghazi and the more tribally based opposition in Derna do not form a united front.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya's reasonable standard of living compared with that of neighbouring countries, thanks to oil revenues, and Gadaffi's &quot;modernised&quot; yet anti- Western Islam have not been conducive to the emergence of fundamentalist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gadaffi has always shown great skill in manipulating the various forces at work in Libya - the army, the still well-structured tribes, and the institutions established after the 1969 revolution, and at 54 it lookes as though he still has plenty of mileage left.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Air Zimbabwe, once a profitable little airline with an on-time record, now has a reputation for delays and debt as poor management and political interference thwart viability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the problem is President Robert Mugabe's habit of requisitioning planes whenever he needs to travel abroad - often several times a month. But the airline also has to cope with craft unsuited to Zimbabwe's conditions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, Air Zimbabwe inherited a fleet of ancient but reliable workhorses such as the Vickers Viscount for routes which extended no further north than Kariba. Rapid expansion in the early 1980s saw new schedules to London, Frankfurt and Athens serviced by jets purchased from Boeing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But political meddling was evident early on. A former transport minister, Herbert Ushewokunze, insisted upon personally designing the livery of the new fleet, ignoring the submissions of his advisory panel. Interference led in recent years to the acquisition of aircraft which proved inappropriate for the airline's needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Zimbabwe currently leases a British Aerospace 146 bought in 1989 by the air force for Mugabe's use. When the aircraft proved unsuitable for non-stop journeys to Europe, Mugabe resorted to requisitioning other planes for what the airline calls &quot;VVIP charters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has led to passengers being abandoned at airports, the airline incurring accommodation charges, and costly rescheduling. In August and September, Air Zimbabwe saw its aircraft diverted to Cape Town for Mugabe's honeymoon, to Lesotho for a meeting of regional heads of state, to Cape Town to collect the first lady, to Kenya for the opening of the Mombasa agricultural show, to Jamaica for a state visit, and to Hamburg for an investment conference. Mugabe will also soon be going to Switzerland and Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president is not the only culprit. Last month passengers flying from London to Harare suddenly found themselves diverted to Cairo to collect Vice- President Joshua Nkomo and his entourage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those on local flights fare even worse. Passengers and their luggage have been dumped at tourist resorts such as Hwange and Victoria Falls as pilots attempt to lighten the load on two leased Fokker 50 aircraft struggling with the country's heat and altitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fokker lease - costing the airline $130000 a month - will soon be scrapped after MPs described it as &quot;ill-considered&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline's managing director, Huttish Muringi, is on extended leave pending investigations into the Fokker deal - negotiated against the advice of specialists - and his acquisition of a R700 000 car and a R850 000 company house. While the airline turned a modest operating profit this year, it owes over R200-million on previous borrowings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josephine Mukankusi cannot even look back on her wedding with happiness for she remembers who was there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her brother was just a young boy when she married in 1970. Even so, his betrayal has been hardest to fathom. The uncles who came to congratulate Josephine and her young husband, Edouard, showed no malice then. And there was Jean-Paul Akayesu. He used to drink at their house and rose to become mayor of their hillside commune at Taba in central Rwanda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to ask them all why they did this - my brother, my uncles, Akayesu. Akayesu was a friend of my husband's. They grew up together. He knew our children. We thought he was a good man. The same people who drank at our wedding murdered my family. I want to know why,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda's age-old divisions did not discourage Josephine, a Hutu, from marrying a Tutsi man. Mixed marriages were relatively common around Taba.  Three of Josephine's younger sisters followed her lead and married Tutsis. It had never bothered Akayesu either, until the start of the civil war in 1990 threw the loyalties of all Tutsis into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akayesu, as local chairman of an extremist Hutu political party, could no longer afford such friends, but he did not go out of his way to bother them.  And when, in April 1994, war turned to genocide, Akayesu again appeared at Josephine's door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said we should stay calm and nothing would happen to us. Now I think he meant to confuse us,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mukankusis sensed betrayal. They had already fled as their Hutu neighbours descended to loot and destroy their prosperous home built from Edouard's years of labour as a mason. A local schoolteacher, who taught one of Josephine's six children, oversaw the demolition. Two days later the Hutu extremist militia, the interahamwe, began hunting Tutsi men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From her hiding place in the bush, Josephine saw the fate of those who fell into the hands of drunken young thugs who sometimes wore absurd outfits, even women's clothes or wigs, as if to take on another persona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Always they carried machetes or, an interahamwe favourite, thick wooden clubs studded with nails and other bits of metal. Invariably they were led by the better- educated members of the community. Doctors and teachers were particularly active. So was Akayesu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We were all together in the bush but we could see what was happening and my husband was afraid he would attract the interahamwe who would kill the children. So he left,&quot; Josephine said. &quot;He was looking for a hiding place when the interahamwe grabbed him. They led him to a pit latrine and stabbed him with sharpened sticks and beat him with machetes. He was still alive when they threw him in. Then they threw stones at him until he died. Even children and women were stoning him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Josephine's sisters, Vestine, had also fled her home. Her husband, Bernard, urged her to go to her Hutu parents for the sake of the children but she refused to be separated. A Hutu soldier, a friend of Bernard's, offered them shelter in his house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The soldier would go out, kill Tutsis and come home describing the horrible deaths people were suffering. My husband offered to pay the soldier to shoot us if they came for us,&quot; Vestine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A problem developed because his wife thought I was sleeping with the soldier. When the soldier was transferred, the wife threw us out and told Akayesu we were there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't long before the interahamwe came looking for Bernard. He was hidden deep in a banana plantation. Vestine bribed them but she realised it was too dangerous to remain where they were. She would head for her parents after all. Bernard went to his brother-in-law, Simon Bivahagumye, travelling through the hills at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon liked Bernard but feared he would bring the interahamwe knocking at the door, so he offered to help find somewhere safe. The two men left at night but could not escape the militia. Money changed hands. Bernard fled.  Simon returned to his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interahamwe thugs fought over the bribe. It was said everybody in the area heard them. When word spread about the cause of the commotion there was a lot of surprise. Most people had presumed Bernard was already dead. The militia descended on Simon's house. He was accused of hiding Bernard and helping him escape. Simon, his wife and two sons were shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josephine's grief at Edouard's murder was tempered by the lone responsibility of protecting her children. She fled the bush for the temporary safety of a kind relative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My aunt was a good Samaritan and gave us a bed. But her husband was interahamwe who spent most of the day killing. In the evening when the husband returned, I would hide in the plantation. But the woman gave us food and let us sleep in the beds during the day. We stayed there for about six weeks but my aunt heard they were killing people who sheltered Tutsis. She was afraid and asked us to go,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josephine headed for the one place she was sure of a welcome - her parents' house - even if others knew it was the place to look for her. Getting there carried its own dangers. The roadblocks were terrifying but Josephine talked and bribed her way through each one. Two days after arriving at her parents, a group of men descended on the house. They wanted Josephine's boy. She pleaded that he was just three years old. No matter, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were not killing girls, only boys. They marched me to the hill and took the baby from my back. Then they killed him in front of me,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One by one the four sisters gravitated toward their parents' house.  Uwidikije was already there with her only child when Josephine arrived. Then came Marceline with her four children. Her husband had been murdered while trying to defend his house from a demolition squad. A week later Vestine arrived. With their parents, and two younger unmarried sisters, the house was overflowing. The murder of Josephine's youngest boy left 14 other children.  Their protection was all that mattered to the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) was drawing ever closer to Taba. The sisters knew they had only to keep their children from the interahamwe's for just a few more days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akayesu, as mayor, had already overseen the murder of hundreds if not thousands of Tutsis. There were few adult Tutsis left but the militias knew there were still children, and word spread the girls were no longer to be spared. Akayesu even ordered Hutu women pregnant by Tutsi men to be cut open and their foetuses killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sisters moved quickly to find hiding places for their children. The older ones were shown how to hide themselves in the banana groves. The youngest were told that if strangers came they were to hide in cupboards or under the beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was one visitor who worried everyone but who it was all but impossible to keep away. The sisters only brother, Malachias, lived not far away and would drop by the house. The family knew he helped man the roadblocks where so many Tutsis met their end. Josephine and Vestine did not trust him to protect his own family, but their parents assured them Malachias would not bring about the death of his nieces and nephews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't long before the first groups of men came knocking. Often they were led by Akayesu and mayor of the neighbouring commune, Jean Mbarubukeye.  They had become a team intent of mopping up the last of the Tutsis before the RPF arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They came to search day and night. We would change the hiding places when we saw people coming across the hill to the house. Sometimes we would use dried banana grass. If you pile it high you can put the small children in there and tell them to keep very still. Sometimes we would put the children inside the house. Or we would hide them in the bush,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernard apparently knew nothing of the murder of Simon and his family as he headed for another brother-in-law's house in Akayesu's commune. Vestine's husband was one of the few Tutsi men still alive in the area. It was only a matter of time before the interahamwe thought to look for him there, but he was increasingly desperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernard had little chance of escape. With the RPF's guns echoing through the hills he had become the most hunted man in Taba. Word spread that he was passing secret messages to the Tutsi rebels, and stashing weapons. Yet when they found Bernard he was alone and defenceless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As they led him to the main barrier beside Taba market they were cutting him with machetes. He was very badly hurt and bleeding. He hit Silas, the president of the interahamwe. The bodyguards shot him dead. That was his end.  I think he attacked Silas so they would kill him quickly,&quot; Vestine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernard's death reminded the mob there were still more Tutsis to be dealt with. Akayesu was at the front as they marched on the house. Silas was at his side, angry and shaken at Bernard's defiant assault. He wanted Vestine to pay.  As the mob ascended the hill, the children scattered to their hiding places.  Josephine had gone to buy food. Vestine was outside the house. &quot;Akayesu pointed me out to Silas. They beat me and they beat my father for offering his daughters to the Tutsis. It just went on and on until I nearly couldn't see anymore. I just lay there. My eyes filled with blood,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Vestine could see the mob moving toward the house. At the forefront was her brother, pointing out the hiding places of the children. They came from cupboards and under beds, from beneath the dried grass and from the banana plantation. Akayesu assured the children that everything would be all right, as he had assured their parents that nothing would happen to them after the genocide started. He told the children they were going for a treat. They should just follow him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The older children picked up the small ones and they began the walk to the barricade near the main road junction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The children carried each other to their deaths. Akayesu told them he was taking them to give them cakes. They went to their deaths with pleasure,&quot; Vestine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akayesu did not wait around. Perhaps, with the RPF close by, he did not want to be at the scene of his last crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the mob recognised some of the children. The mob included one of their teachers, and mothers of their classmates. But mostly they were drunken young thugs who the following day would turn and run without a hint of resistance into the face of the RPF onslaught. The 14 children were clubbed and cut to pieces. They were almost certainly all dead by the time they were thrown into the pit latrines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An hour later Josephine returned home. She saw Vestine, bloodied and beaten.  The children had gone. She ran for the barricade. &quot;I begged them to kill me too. They were supposed to be merciless but they refused. They said 'Sorrow will kill you'.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was the arch-colonist a monster? Or is the script just being PC? And was he gay?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC's television series on Cecil John Rhodes - coming to South Africa early next year - has sparked fierce controversy over Southern Africa's most famous colonist: was he saint, sinner or pervert? Or all three?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several British critics are have lashed out at the &quot;monsterisation&quot; of Rhodes and questioned scriptwriter Anthony Thomas's view of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhodesian-born journalist Peter Godwin criticised the series: &quot;There is a danger of wrenching a life too far out of its own context and examining it though the microscope of today's sensibilities ... Rhodes and the white pioneers in Southern Africa did behave despicably, certainly by today's standards but perhaps they behaved no worse than the white settlers in North America, South America, Australia ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Thomas hit back, calling Godwin's criticism &quot;very bizarre. He is so ignorant of the times and the man. He goes bananas about showing Rhodes stroking a lion cub and says we are borrowing this from a James Bond move, but Rhodes was famous for his lion cubs. There are pictures and documentary evidence to prove this,&quot; said Thomas</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas was brought to South Africa at age six and taught by his grandparents to see Rhodes as &quot;a demi-god&quot;, a glorious symbol of the British empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Going to Rhodes Memorial with my grandparents was like the experience of a Catholic child being taken to see the Virgin in the grotto,&quot; he said. They &quot; thought the Rhodes tradition was humane, something that set us</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apart from the Afrikaners who were turning South Africa into an international pariah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas says he has had only compliments from historians who have reviewed his work, and feels satisfied negative comments come from &quot;snipers on the sidelines&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A supporter of the African National Congress, he has developed something of an obsession with Rhodes - the man, the series and now the book, the writing of which appears to have been something of a personal political catharsis for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claims his biography of Rhodes (yet to hit the shelves) is the &quot; definitive&quot; Rhodes biography. He worked with original source material, and the book has already sold 15 000 copies in advance orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we have had some wonderful early biographies of Rhodes which are very thin on historical details,&quot; he says. Some, he believes, &quot;have no sense of the man at all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sees Rhodes as the father of apartheid. He says the 1894 Glen Grey Act, engineered by Rhodes to prevent competition for land ownership by black people, was the &quot;template for the bantustan policy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agricultural schools for black people, taking them out of missionary schools, he says, &quot;anticipated Hendrik Verwoerd's education policy&quot;. Rhodes, too, &quot;introduced discrimination in transport and in facilities in the cities.  The only things that were missing were the signs which said 'whites' and 'non- whites'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet a previous Rhodes biographer takes issue with this interpretation.  Appollin Davidson, head of the University of Cape Town's Centre for Russian Studies, started researching Rhodes in 1959. His biography was published in Russian in 1984 and in English in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davidson said that being a racist did not make Rhodes the father of apartheid, and while Rhodes had done many bad things, he had also developed Southern Africa in a way settlers in other colonies had not. He argues, like Godwin, that Rhodes should be judged in terms of his times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davidson was contacted by the BBC 10 days ago. He was asked about Rhodes's alleged homosexuality, which appears to be a particularly juicy bone of contention. The BBC's post-production consultation suggests some unease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of the series in South Africa is described in a gushy publicity pack which talks of the fire which nearly destroyed the sets; various acts of bravery; and the dangers of snakes, wild animals and untarred roads. It also has a chapter on the Zulus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Shaw, who plays Rhodes, said:&quot;Politically and emotionally I see Rhodes as a monster, but while I was playing him I had to put my own beliefs away. He was an incredibly complex man. He had all the characteristics of a megalomaniac but immense personal charm and charisma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sidebar: Script Ruined By PC Slant, Says Author</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Godwin, author of the bestselling book Mukiwa: A White Boy in Africa, has slated the TV series Rhodes for judging a man of yesterday by the morals of today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rhodes is a stirring and affecting television production, beautifully filmed, but it feels like a work overwhelmed by ... the very worst interpretation of the man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the London Guardian, Godwin writes that the series is an attempt by scriptwriter Anthony Thomas to be politically correct and to debunk the existing Rhodes mythology. But, he says, &quot;there is little mythology left to debunk, so it goes further, presenting Rhodes as a caricature of pure evil&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Godwin picks out the portrayal of the demise of Matabele Chief Lobengula as an example: &quot;Before one dissolves into a sobbing heap at Lobengula's terrible fate at Rhodes's hands, for example, we should remember that Lobengula was a bloodthirsty tyrant himself, whose people had arrived as colonists themselves, only a generation before, wiping out most of the Mashona who lived there, and treating the rest as slaves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Godwin also takes issue with the BBC's treatment of Rhodes's homosexuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The gaying of Rhodes is reinforced by some heavy-handed televisual nudging.  Horse-play in the bath with his faithful black manservant, Christmas, playfully deploying a soda siphon; Rhodes's smouldering glances at the eight- year-old Harry Currey clearly signal a penchant for little boys ... The glee with which the homosexuality is portrayed verges itself on homophobic - it's almost as if to taunt: Old Rhodes wasn't just a racist, genocidal gangster - guess what? He was a poof to boot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Godwin concludes by pointing out that, despite Rhodes's bad press, his grave in Zimbabwe has been left in peace where other white graves have been smashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scriptwriter Anthony Thomas says Godwin's criticism is bizarre and ignorant of historical facts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Britain's huge cash bonanza shows how a lottery can help South Africa, but the local wheels of fortune fail to spin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's first national lottery - which is expected to make a major contribution towards dealing with the government's financial troubles - is now only expected to be launched by mid-1998 at the earliest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delays are causing some frustration among foreign corporations keen to run the lottery. Debate on the draft National Lotteries Bill is only expected to take place next month, and the government still has to appoint a consultant to study the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of the operation -about four years after the idea was first mooted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain took just two-and-a-half years to get its hugely successful lottery off the ground. In the first 18 months of its operation it has raked in R7- billion in taxes and R15,4-billion for charity and other &quot;good works&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public hearings are expected next year for the appointment of a South African National Lotteries Board and tenders for the lucrative contract to operate the lottery on behalf of the government will only open in late 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some industry sources say they have lost interest in the lengthy process, the delays appear to have merely intensified the interest of leading bidders, who have begun actively lobbying officials connected to the operation even before the public debate has officially opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other industry observers say vested interests could be behind the delays.  They suspect some players in the gambling world - in particular the horse- racing industry - have been trying to postpone the creation of a lottery, having learnt from the experiences of the British pools operators who lost hugely to the British lottery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Congress MP Llewellyn Landers told the Mail &amp; Guardian he and other members of the parliamentary ad-hoc committee on gambling and lotteries he chairs had been approached by legal representatives of several companies interested in bidding for the exclusive right to operate what is expected to be a multi-billion rand enterprise: &quot;People call us up and invite us to lunch or cocktail parties, hoping to give us a presentation, even though we have nothing to do with the selection of the lottery operator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landers said he had invited interested parties to address the entire committee during public hearings on the draft Bill, which may be held early next month. The pressure by companies hoping to stake a claim on the exclusive contract had become so great, however, that invitations to the debate had to include a request that parties restrict their submissions to the content of the legislation. &quot;We don't want to be hearing bids in Parliament,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alistair Ruiters, the Trade and Industry Department chief director who inherited the lottery process from former provincial and constitutional affairs minister Chris Fismer when the National Party left the government, said his department had tried to expedite the &quot;complicated process&quot;, but that extensive consultations were required at each stage of the process. Time had also been spent raising money to pay the consultant who would soon be hired to &quot;study the nuts and bolts of the operation&quot; in advance of the bidding process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruiters declined to comment on the potential bidders, but admitted that &quot; conservative estimates&quot; suggesting the lottery could generate about R2- billion annually and had drawn international interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry sources predict a fierce contest between &quot;five or six&quot; local and international contenders. The South African Postal Service and Games Africa are expected to lead the local bids, while United States- based firms GTECH and International Lottery Totalizator Systems (ILTS) have been tipped as leading international contenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British and a French firm are also reportedly interested in the bid, although this could not be confirmed at the time of publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most post offices already sell scratch cards and the lottery operation would be a lucrative feather in the service's recently commercialised cap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Games Africa has been laying the groundwork for the lottery since its 1992 R17-million launch as the dominant force in the national scratch-card industry with the Ithuba and Viva cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Lotteries Bill provides for government ownership of the lottery - whose proceeds will fund the Reconstruction and Development Programme, charities, sports and recreation, arts and culture, and various other projects - companies bidding for the operating contract expect their percentage payout will offer a healthy profit beyond the cost of providing and installing hundreds of on-line machines and managing the venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues ranging from efficiency to affirmative action will dominate the tender process, but the key question of which company can generate the largest proceeds may see international firms giving local contenders a run for their money. Both GTECH and ILTS say they are likely to form local partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Virgin Group chairman Richard Branson told the M&amp;G he believed South Africa should avoid handing the lottery operation over to a private company, but should rather appoint a chief executive to maximise earnings for public projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sidebar: Punters' Dreams Pay Off For People</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by David Beresford</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the United Kingdom's Conservative government announced plans to launch its national lottery in 1992 - the last country to do so in Western Europe - nobody realised the extraordinary impact it would have on British society.  With an estimated 65% of the population handing over their *1 every week in pursuit of the 14-million-to-one chance of hitting the jackpot, churchmen have ruefully compared lottery fever to the hysteria of religious revivalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one Church of England cleric put it: &quot;Week by week, people queue up to worship. New places of worship have sprung up on almost every street corner.  The worshippers go with their collection in their hands. It is as though they have seen their God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the nation as a whole is highly enthusiastic. As Prime Minister John Major put it, the lottery will &quot;leave our legacy for the future&quot;. It just takes a walk around some of the cultural centres of Britain and the sight of builders hard at work on sites such as Covent Garden and Sadlers Wells to appreciate what he meant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cash bonanza has been staggering. The latest figures show sales for the weekly draw and linked scratch-card lotteries have topped R56-billion in the first 18 months of operations. Half the money has been spent on prizes, with R15,4-billion going to the good causes. Even Inland Revenue has been singing, taking R7-billion in tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lottery has not been without controversy, however, and the British experience has offered some timely lessons to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First there have been those who have objected to the principle of the whole exercise, ranging from moralists to renowned cosmologist Stephen Hawking, who described the odds as &quot;shabby&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More serious controversy has arisen over the profit being taken by operating company Camelot, which - the country has belatedly realised - has been given a licence to print money which beggars comparison. The company - jointly owned by Cadbury Schweppes, De La Rue, ICL, Racal and the United States lottery operator GTECH - has a seven-year contract to run the lottery, which is expected to have earned it R5-billion by the time it expires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its profits, and the huge bonuses the directors have paid themselves, have inevitably resulted in demands for the nationalisation of the lottery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the more bitter critics are Virgin's Richard Branson, who had offered to run the lottery on a no-profit basis. He has also made allegations of corruption, accusing GTECH - one of the leading contenders for the South African lottery - of having offered him a bribe to stay out of the running for the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally heated have been the arguments over the beneficiaries from the &quot; good works&quot; bonanza. The donation of R675-million for a rugby stadium in Wales prompted something of a class war between sports lovers and culture buffs who had wanted the money spent on a Welsh opera house. The payment of R90- million to Winston Churchill's grandson for the war-time premier's personal papers was the subject of national indignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-time sailor, Prince Philip, protested to Major at the failure of the lottery to pump funds into the National Maritime Museum. Prince Charles has publicly complained that lottery money is being frittered away, arguing it should be used more spiritually - to &quot;create places of worship, to erect buildings of real quality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whether the money is used in the hunt for a cancer cure, the creation of a &quot;megamarina&quot; in Portsmouth harbour, a virtual reality centre in Manchester, or a 10 400km path winding the length and breadth of Britain, the British lottery - and not just the jackpot - is truly the stuff of which dreams are made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Two South African women - parliamentary Speaker Frene Ginwala and Judge Navi Pillay - have been nominated for the position of secretary general of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's rights activists proposed them, and they are among six candidates put forward by an international women's group. The campaign to install a woman in the UN's top post follows calls by the 1995 Beijing Women's Conference for the promotion of women to senior posts in the world body.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African affiliates of United States- based international women's rights campaigners Equality Now are compiling a petition to urge President Nelson Mandela to nominate a South African woman for the post, which is up for grabs in December at the end of incumbent Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali's first five-year term. The group's 2 000 affiliates in 65 countries are campaigning for their own governments to back a woman candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayesha Mahomed, a South African representative of Equality Now, said the group is calling on the government to &quot;put its money where its mouth is and apply its commitment to gender equality to foreign affairs policy. In the 50- year history of the UN, there has never been a woman secretary general. It's our turn now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government representative suggested, however, that prior regional agreements may prevent South Africa forwarding a female nomination. Both the Organisation of African Unity and the Southern African Development Community recently agreed to back Boutros- Ghali - the first African to occupy the post - for re-election. The SADC did so after a proposal by Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ginwala has been accused of taking a &quot;high- handed&quot; approach in Parliament, but even her critics admit she has handled a rough transition efficiently, standing her in good stead for the task of rationalising the UN beauracracy and forcing member states - most notably the US - to cough up the R14-billion in outstanding dues needed to keep the body afloat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pillay, who chairs Equality Now, made judicial history with her 1994 appointment to the Durban Supreme Court Bench and is now making her mark internationally in the UN's International Rwanda Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both have been active in the liberation movement and have made their mark on global women's rights campaigns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Robert SobukweR must be turning restlessly in his grave at the latest high-profile Pan Africanist Congress's (PAC) failure to resuscitate his dream at its weekend convention in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speeches on the opening day stated how the PAC would be &quot;totally overhauled&quot; and &quot;transformed&quot; to become a &quot;vanguard of the have-nots&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics said the convention was merely a &quot;symbolic show of unity,&quot; which failed to come up with new ideas to lead the PAC out of near political oblivion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the PAC &quot;re-affirmed&quot; positions on various issues. President Clarence Makwetu, whom militant youths have blamed for the PAC's empty coffers remains firmly in place - at least until the party's December congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some party members said they were disappointed that the convention lacked powers to change party structures. Resolutions, taken at the convention - for example, on consolidation of leadership among the party's various bodies - need to be ratified by the congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Faried Esack, a University of the Western Cape academic, said the convention failed to address contradictions within the PAC. &quot;Until they have resolved their problems they will not come out of the doldrums that they are in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political commentator, Ashwin Desai, said the unity portrayed at the convention was &quot;public posturing&quot; and a &quot;temporary phenomenon&quot;. While the PAC &quot;never really had the support it claimed,&quot; Desai said there was a &quot;fertile ground for a radical opposition&quot; in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convention convenor Ike Mafole said criticisms were unfair because the convention had been fruitful and that resolutions that had been made would be implemented at grassroots level.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The way in which Thulamela has been excavated has marked a global breakthrough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who built Thulamela, a medieval citadel in the far north of the Kruger National Park that has recently excited fascination in local and international academic circles, will never know it. But they may have helped resolve one of the most burning issues for archaeologists around the world today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethnic and cultural organisations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States and Israel have recently forced museums and universities to return valuable human remains, many of them collected under dubious circumstances in the 1800s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Congress passed legislation in 1989 that requires all pre-1770 physical remains to be controlled by Native American authorities. Israel recently handed down a new interpretation of the Antiquities Act resulting in the reburial of all human remains younger than 5 000 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Pfeiffer, a physical anthropologist at the University of Guelph in the United States, has likened the reburial of skeletons to &quot;book-burning&quot;.  Archaeologist Israel Hershkovits, who now sits with empty shelves at the Sackler School of Medicine in Tel Aviv because the state recently acceded to restitution demands from orthodox groups, has declared: &quot;It's the end of anthropology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That prospect has been averted by South African scientists working at Thulamela because these academics have, apparently for the first time in the history of archaeology, devised techniques for excavating and reburying the skeletons of Thulamela's chief and his probable wife that marry community demands with the needs of science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrangement, hammered out between a team of scientists led by archaeologist Sydney Miller and a committee of representatives from communities that have a claim to Thulamela's heritage, involves taking samples of DNA and carbon isotopes from the skeletons and preserving the data contained in them before the bones are reburied in a dignified ceremony run by the people of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marius Loots, researcher at the anatomy department at the University of Pretoria, says small samples of DNA and carbon traces will provide scientists with clues about kinship relations that governed the network of African cities that stretched across the Limpopo during the Middle Ages in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis of the carbon samples taken will provide a vital glimpse into the diet and pastoral habits of Thulamela's rulers. They will also throw light on how the inhabitants of Thulamela lived off the mix of indigenous plant and animal life, that has been preserved in the Kruger Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, though, Miller along with park officials, is involved in negotiating a way of reburying the bones so that the ceremony satisfies the communities' cultural and religious need to respect the dignity of their ancestors with the possibility that scientists and researchers might need to reopen the graves for analytical purposes in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal represents, in essence, an ability to translate South Africans' skill for negotiating solutions to deep-rooted political conflicts into a method for solving one of the trickiest ethical questions in archaeology and anthropology today. Although fairly simple in its outlines, this kind of arrangement has apparently seldom been achieved in other parts of the world where efforts to resolve the science-vs-human rights debates have been bedevilled by polarisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as we know this is the first time that a negotiated compromise between indigenous organisations and scientists has been worked out proactively,&quot; says Koen Nienaber, another reseacher from Pretoria University.  &quot;There are examples from Canada, New Zealand and Australia where some agreements were made but these were usually done after the issue and conflict had already become extremely heated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That achievement - the ability to create an academic version of South Africa's &quot;rainbow&quot; phenomenon in this far-flung corner of the country - was captured in a single snapshot from the official opening of Thulamela this week: a long line of traditional chiefs, brightly bedecked indigenous healers, scientists, politicians, journalists, corporate executives and children who filed solemnly up the hill under the watch of armed game guards to see the sacred site for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the media coverage of Thulamela has centred on the beauty of the jewellery and cultural artefacts found at the site and the magical quality of the rugged hilltop that is surrounded by a forest of giant baobabs in the remote northern reaches of the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intricately fashioned gold bracelets and beads, hoes, harpoons to hunt hippo, royal gongs from West Africa, pieces of porcelain from the Ming dynasty in China and beads from India indicate the civilisation of which Thulamela formed a part had developed an industrial base as well as intricate trade and diplomatic relations with other parts of the world at a time when the Ottoman and Mogul empires ruled parts of Asia and Henry VIII was beheading his wives in England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Environment and Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan said when he officially opened the site this week, the finds have finally debunked the myth that this was part of a dark and uncivilised continent before white men arrived in the 15th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But although Thulamela is also special because the graves were scientifically excavated before they could be plundered by gold robbers who denuded many other similar sites of their cultural value, most of this has already been demonstrated by other studies of African settlements in the Limpopo Valley linked to the great Zimbabwe civilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thulamela has the advantage of being relatively small, and controlled partial excavation of a formerly pristine site by professional archaeologists has revealed a wealth of detail about its elite inhabitants in a fairly short of space of time,&quot; says Duncan Miller, a scientist analysing Thulamela's metal artefacts at the University of Cape Town's (UCT) archaeology department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a significant archaeological discovery with huge potential for edifying the public. In themselves the observations from this site don't appear to be revolutionary, but nicely confirm what has long been known from sites such as Mapungubwe, Great Zimbabwe and other elite walled residences in Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Sillen, professor of archaeology at UCT, agrees the breakthrough at Thulamela lies not in what lies in its royal graves but in the way their excavation was carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The key aspect of any reburial agreement between scientists and communities is future access to the burial site. For one thing, it isn't possible to anticipate what techniques of analysis will be available in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, in order to be scientifically legitimate, the results of current investigations would need to be replicable by subsequent investigators. If such future access is contemplated in the current Thulamela arrangement for restitution, this would indeed be a breakthrough.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the shattered community at Stilfontein started recovering from the violence which left at least 24 dead, it emerged that police at the miners' settlement have been told to shoot any miners caught inciting violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police have been given the right to kill,&quot; said Sixtus Sethunya, senior hostel personnel assistant at Scott Hostel, near the old Stilfontein Gold Mine. Sethunya was defying management's orders that no journalists were to be taken into the hostel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's ethnic violence between Xhosa and Sotho workers appears to have been triggered by the murders of 10 mineworkers who were living at Springvale farm, about 3km from Buffelsfonetin No 2 where they work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basil King, human resources manager at Buffelsfontein's No 2 hostel, said the violence had been between contract workers at Scott and Pioneer hostel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sotho miner at Scott hostel, Sipho Leseske, claims management was favouring Xhosa workers. &quot;We are scared to go to the hostel because they have guns, management gives into their demands very easily,&quot; he said. According to Leseke, the Sotho workers had to sleep outside and they had not eaten for two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resident of Springvale farm, Fele Mayisele, said a large group of Pondos attacked the hostel at 11pm last Saturday night. The group knocked on people's doors before attacking with pangas and spears. She could not understand why they attacked the hostel because all the tribes live together at the farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police believe the attack came from Pioneer hostel shaft. The manager at Pioneer hostel, Abraham Ntsili, said it was possible that the attack came from Xhosas who may have formed gangs following the death of a Xhosa worker at Springvale farm two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second round of killings late on Wednesday night brought the week's death toll to 24. Investigating officer Colonel Attie Prinsloo said the latest victims are all miners and not contract workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Union of Mineworkers yesterday appealed for calm. They are expected to hold a meeting with miners to end the violence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the week when at least 24 mineworkers were slain, fears are mounting that a major judicial inquiry into mine violence will be torpedoed by the absence of the United Workers Union of South Africa (Uwusa) from the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission of inquiry is concentrating on the spate of killings at Goldfields's mines in recent months which has left 48 workers dead. The battle, mainly between Uwusa and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), has stripped almost R70-million from Goldfields's profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Inkatha-aligned Uwusa claims it cannot afford to pay lawyers to represent it at the commission after the Legal Aid Board turned down a request for assistance. Judge John Myburgh, who is chairing the inquiry, is understood to be urging the board to reconsider.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uwusa official Duke Senakgono said the union feared the commission would not be impartial as it had been appointed by the African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the focus on Goldfields, the eruption of violence near the Randgold- owned Buffelsfontein mine this week served as a reminder that the commission's findings could be crucial for the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even without Uwusa, the atmosphere is adversarial. On the one side are lawyers representing NUM. They argue that Uwusa's lack of support for NUM's wage demand in mid-July and the gun shot allegedly fired at marchers from Uwusa members at East Driefontein mine triggered the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side are police representatives who have argued that the NUM strike in July was illegal. Police investigator Petrus Peche told the commission he believed &quot;the initial violence may have been instigated by the NUM to achieve goals other than the goals stated for their mass action&quot;. He added that hired external operatives, who had killed members from both unions, could have fanned the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NUM's statement to the commission suggests that the mines' security operatives colluded with the aggressors by failing to take away their weapons at the hostel's entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although weapon searches could have been carried out daily, the police argue they had insufficient manpower. They have arrested remarkably few people considering the number of incidents. The 11 arrests which followed the murder of Bheki Ndlovu fell flat - all the cases were withdrawn owing to a legal technicality which has since been rectified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most illuminating testimony has been from labour expert Dr Kent McNamarra who has conducted in-depth studies into mine violence. McNamarra's apolitical explanation was that a lethal cocktail of xenophobia, fear, tension stemming from overcrowding, and sexual frustration was behind much of the violence which has hit the mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average number of people in each room at the hostels is 17 at East Driefontein, 16 at Leeudorn and 12 at Northam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uwusa has opposed calls by NUM to scrap the practice of housing workers according to ethnic groups. &quot;Hostel integration ... is just a ploy by NUM to intimidate workers to join their organisation,&quot; said Uwusa representative Duke Senakgomo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Thousands of children are living in terrible conditions in places of safety in South Africa - often without sufficient clothing and bedding at night, without proper educational facilities and in buildings that are unhealthy and unsafe - according to a recently released government report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the more than 6 000 children in reform schools, schools of industry and places of safety, more than 60% are there not because they have committed a crime or are awaiting trial, but because they have been identified by social workers as having being exposed to physical or sexual abuse, or neglect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when they are put in the hands of the state, they experience what Lesley du Toit, manager of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Young People at Risk which wrote the report, calls &quot;secondary abuse&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secondary abuse&quot; can take many forms. It can be formal and systematic - the &quot;control and punishment&quot; approach of most institutions, where there are too few staff who are badly paid and under-trained. Under this approach children are locked in dormitories at night and have their letters read and often withheld, and their holidays at home are seen as a privilege, not a right. Many live in run-down buildings, where they sleep under soiled sheets and too-few blankets alongside reeking toilets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The abuse can also be informal, though just as systematic. Children interviewed told of emotional, physical and sexual abuse, by staff as well as other children. The report details widespread violations of children's rights as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UN's Rules for Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty and the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youngsters who attempted suicide, abused substances, mutilated themselves, were aggressive or behaved in other ways typical of troubled young people did not receive therapy, but were seen as &quot;bad&quot; and were usually harshly punished.  While the quality of care differs widely, staff &quot;at all levels&quot; were found to lack experience and expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Centres that previously catered for black children were found to have the worst facilities, but wide discrepancies exist generally. Girls at Le Fleur School of Industry at Faure, outside Cape Town, live in run-down buildings the principal says were declared unfit for human habitation in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wind and rain blow in through broken windows; there is no heating. There are open toilets in the dormitories; the girls are routinely tested for HIV without their consent. Their education is based on an outdated curriculum; there are no recreation programmes. There are not enough uniforms to go around and those that there are are old and stained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Val du Charon industrial school in Wellington in the Cape on the other hand, each girl gets two sets of uniforms for weekdays, a uniform for going out on weekends, floral dresses to wear in the afternoons and track suits for winter, The school offers &quot;excellent, market-related&quot; courses in educare, hair-dressing and catering. The report says the difference in treatment of girls at the two schools is &quot;inexplicable&quot;: both previously catered exclusively for girls classified coloured and fell under the House of Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How bad things can be for children at facilities previously designated for blacks is illustrated by the report's description of Tsheretselong Detention Centre in Bloemfontein, a place of safety that only takes children awaiting trial. It says: &quot;sanitary conditions are unacceptable. The ablution block has broken windows, broken wash basins and broken taps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Human excrement was found on the floors and in the showers ... a result of too few toilets available at any time ... A lack of paper seems to lead to ...  children having to use their clothing to clean themselves&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children at Tsheretselong are cared for by security officers. No youth workers are employed. &quot;The eight girls in this facility sit on a bench all day under the watchful eye of a security officer, who also accompanies them to the toilet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although places of safety are intended as short-stay centres where children are assessed and given temporary care, the investigation team found children spending years in them waiting to be placed in children's homes, foster care or schools of industry. &quot;The committee came across children who have been waiting for placement for up to three years, or awaiting trial for up to two years. Children have been known ... to wait ... for up to 12 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the reasons for this were: social workers in agencies and institutions not writing the necessary reports or co- operating with one another; referral agency social workers &quot;not doing anything&quot; once the child was in a place of safety; the Deparment of Education failing to place the child; insufficient probation officers and lack of follow-up and children's homes being full or unwilling to take children with emotional and behavioural problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A child at Tsheretselong awaiting trial on charges of theft was moved between the court in Harrismith and the Bloemfontein detention centre 19 times because the social worker failed to complete a report for the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country has nine reform schools, 18 schools of industry and 32 places of safety. &quot;There is no shortage of bed space for children if one reviews these state institutions as a whole,&quot; says the report. No need, therefore, to detain children - whether sentenced or awaiting trial - in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the report shows, the issue is more complicated than adding up the number of beds available and the number of children needing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welfare Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi has taken on the task of reforming this Dickensian and inefficient system. She has the backing of her Cabinet colleagues, who expressed shock when presented with the committee's findings last week. Cabinet has endorsed her recommendations for short-term, emergency action and longer-term measures, and individual ministers have pledged their commitment to making sure departments take the required action.  But Fraser-Moleketi's keenest champions are likely to be the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sidebar:Children held in isolation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The isolation cell is usually a small, windowless room, perhaps with a tiny observation window or peephole in the door. It generally has no carpeting or furniture, and either a cement block or a thin mattress or mat on the cement floor provides the sleeping space. There is usually an open toilet and sometimes a wash basin ... There is no reading material, although some facilities provide a Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The child or youth placed in isolation is at some facilities permitted to wear only pyjamas, and at some places only short- sleeved shirts, shorts and no footwear. These clothing rules are said to be efforts to prevent attempts at suicide. At one school the blankets and mattresses are taken out of the cells during the day, and the children are left barefoot and wearing shorts and short-sleeved shirts. This particular cell is a barred cell open to the cold air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children were observed shivering with cold; in this particular facility they are sometimes held as long as 28 days.&quot; - Extract from the report of a government investigation into South Africa's reform schools, schools of industry and places of safety</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An investigations team at the Transvaal attorney general's office is working around the clock to probe at least 50 incidents of violence and murder in which security force generals and former Cabinet ministers have been implicated by Eugene de Kock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The barrage of allegations presented in De Kock's testimony in the Pretoria Supreme Court is likely to place the attorney general's office and the criminal justice system under severe stress as each of them has to be investigated and, if they turn out to be accurate, the suspects will be arrested and brought to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But each of the cases that flow out of the De Kock trial could take up to two years or more. This raises the prospect that the country's criminal justice system - already straining under massive workloads and a haemorrhaging of senior staff - will never be able to punish many of the perpetrators mentioned in De Kock's case.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next case initiated by the colonel's trial involve the arrest and prosecution of senior members of the Inkatha Freedom Party. This will be vigorously defended by the IFP, as indicated by the denials that have already emanated from alleged Inkatha warlord Themba Khoza, and is likely to take up as much time and energy as the trials of De Kock and those accused in the Magnus Malan murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney general's office will be hard- pressed to manage just this one trial and will be placed in an almost impossible position if its investigations team comes up with enough evidence, which appears likely, to warrant prosecution related to even a small number of the incidents mentioned by De Kock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the investigators are pressing ahead with their probes and are likely to interview a number of those implicated by De Kock when the supreme court takes its spring recess next week. Although officials in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission are hoping De Kock's revelations will pressure perpetrators into applying for amnesty, it seems most likely that the culprits will simply sit back and rely on the state's lack of capacity to punish them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cross examination of De Kock at the end of this week was expected to focus on his days spent fighting with the police's Koevoet counter-insurgency unit in Namibia in the 1970s. When the case resumes after the week- long break, a psychologist and criminologist are due to present insights into the mental make-up of the colonel who carried out some of the most notorious political assassinations under apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected that Justice Willem van der Merwe will sentence De Kock on around 20 October and the ruling is likely to have a major impact on future decisions about whether the political environment and psychological pressures that dirty tricks operatives worked under provide valid extenuating circumstances for the crimes they committed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When the National Party walked out of the African National Congress-dominated Government of National Unity earlier this year, the Afrikaner Broederbond - now called the Afrikanerbond - lost its last members in Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A body that for almost half a century had direct access to the levers of Afrikaner nationalist government power, and described by the Economist in 1992 as able to &quot;boast a large part in creating and then dismantling apartheid&quot;, the Bond is a victim of a process of change it had helped initiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to Tom de Beer, last chair of the old, secretive Broederbond and first chair of the new, &quot;open&quot; Afrikanerbond, the less cosy relationship with government has its advantages. &quot;In the past, we would have phoned a friend in Pretoria or Cape Town. Now we have to re-evaluate how we work. Actually, it has been pleasantly liberating.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Beer agrees it has not been easy for the membership. When he was first appointed to the Bond's executive in 1991, the organisation counted about 16 000 members. &quot;My guess (at the time) was that if we changed, we'd probably lose about 40%, and if we did not change, we'd also lose about 40%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, today organisational strength is down to 11 000 or 12 000 members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the soul-searching is not over yet. This weekend, the Bond is holding its biennial bondsraad (congress) in Bloemfontein. The main item on the agenda is the way ahead in a democratic South Africa. Says De Beer, former financial director of mining giant Gencor and the man who ushered in a new name and a new non-racial, non-sexist constitution for the Bond in 1994, a year after he became chair: &quot;Some people are still pining for the old days, and for the secrecy. Any great transformation anywhere in the world goes hand in hand with uncertainties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As much as he revels in the liberation the new non-party political stance has brought the Bond, De Beer remains a defender of its past. When broeders caucused an agenda in secret, then sold it to wider society through dominees, school principals, academics and members of government, it smacked little of the conspiratorial style that detractors always accused it of, if De Beer is to be believed. &quot;It was an approach thatcould be used effectively only if your cause was right, as we were never in the majority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He traces the Broederbond's first progressive stirrings back to the 1970s, when it &quot;asked critical questions&quot; over constitutional rights for coloureds, advising the government that &quot;it will not work to hold power in white hands alone&quot;. And the &quot;opinion forming input&quot; of the Bond, he says, played a significant role in facilitating the reforms of the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the Bond, once a brotherhood comparable to the Freemasons in ritual and exclusivity, has allowed its first women and black members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim is that the secrecy is gone. Admittedly, much more of what the organisation does, it does in its own name - like talking to the SABC about language policy, or making proposals on the Constitution, education or community care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But members still have the protection of the organisation if they choose to remain anonymous - De Beer cannot say how many of the National Party's last remaining Cabinet members earlier this year were broeders. What he does say, is that it is &quot;not an unfair assumption&quot; that that is where the Bond lost its representation in the highest level of government. (FW de Klerk is or was one high-profile member, like most senior party colleagues at the height of Afrikaner rule.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that the Bond has been inactive in cultivating friends among the new governing class. Shortly before Nelson Mandela became president, De Beer led an Afrikanerbond delegation to meet him in Shell House, where he was shown the Bond's new constitution. Mandela told them while &quot;he found the old Broederbond reasonably sinister, there was a basis for co-operation based on the new constitution&quot;, says De Beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More contact with ANC government leaders has followed. Mpumalanga premier Matthews Phosa shared a platform with De Beer at a provincial bondsraad meeting last year, Jay Naidoo addressed an Afrikanerbond conference on the RDP, and this year ANC deputy secretary-general Cheryl Carolus addressed a Bond conference in Stellenbosch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the government of the day,&quot; says De Beer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A white South African who became a vice-president of Harvard University is at the centre of a race row over her nomination to join the highest court in Massachusetts in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nomination of Margaret Marshall by Massachusetts governor William Weld to the state's Supreme Judicial Court has enraged black activists, who claim Weld should have nominated a black American instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marshall's fiercest critic so far has been Appeals Court Judge Frederick Brown, who was quoted in The Boston Globe newspaper as saying: &quot;It is a regrettable day in the history of Massachusetts when a white person from South Africa is appointed to the Supreme Judicial Court before any black person.&quot; The judge prefaced his attack by saying her nomination was a &quot; perverted joke&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marshall (52) graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand, where she became the first woman to head the National Union of South African Students (Nusas). In 1968 she emigrated to Boston, where she has had a successful legal career, becoming president of the Boston Bar Association in 1991. She was appointed Harvard's vice-president and chief counsel - the institution's top legal post - in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marshall's opponents are apparently unimpressed with her anti-apartheid credentials. When she arrived in the US, she lobbied against apartheid and backed calls for sanctions against South Africa. According to the The Boston Globe, her critics resent what they see as &quot;a privileged white woman who, while championing their causes, never would have had to suffer their indignities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign against Marshall has included a march to Weld's office by the Urban League, the Black Ministerial Alliance and the Black Lawyers' Guild.  According to the newspaper, the protestors claimed Weld's failure to appoint an African-American was the last straw from an administration which had not adequately addressed the needs of &quot;minorities and poor people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Cape Town vice-chancellor Mamphela Ramphele reportedly expressed amazement at the campaign against Marshall, and in particular the comments made by Judge Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Margie was very courageous ... She is not part of the herd. She wanted liberation in South Africa ... This preoccupation with skin colour is ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marshall, who is married to New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis, declined to talk to the Mail &amp; Guardian ahead of the October 9 hearings for the appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is by all accounts passionate about the US and is even known to have shed tears when recalling the day in 1978 when she became a US citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told a group of immigrants to the US of how, &quot;in my anger and loneliness and despair, I discovered that my own history, my experiences in South Africa, my own dealings with apartheid were powerful resources that I had brought with me to the US. My love affair with the US has grown as I have learned again and again that here ... each new immigrant can make a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suzanne Daley, a correspondent on the New York Times, has made a number of allegations that Ricky Naidoo, press officer to Mbeki, attempted to sexually harass her in return for setting up an interview with his boss.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daley, who is married, has written a letter of complaint which is being investigated by Frank Chikane, head of Mbeki's office. But she refused to detail the exact nature of the harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really don't want to talk about it except to confirm that I have written a letter,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo on the other hand is furious. &quot;These are malicious allegations and as far as I am concerned there is no truth to them whatsoever,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mojanku Gumbi, a legal adviser to Mbeki's office said the matter was being investigated under the Public Service Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The start of the long-delayed international Rwanda genocide tribunal ran into new difficulties this week after the lawyer for the first Hutu scheduled to appear in the dock said he will boycott the trial because he has been prevented from putting together a case and is owed expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial of Jean-Paul Akayesu, a Hutu former mayor charged with genocide and crimes against humanity for his part in the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis across Rwanda in 1994, is still expected to take place in Arusha, Tanzania. But it looks increasingly likely to be put on hold, further undermining confidence in a tribunal plagued by inadequate funding, infighting and charges of incompetence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal has indicted 22 Rwandans, of which four are in custody in Arusha, and another six are held in Cameroon, Belgium and Switzerland awaiting extradition. The court on Wednesday rejected an appeal to release one of the men in its custody on humanitarian grounds because he is seriously ill, reportedly with Aids. But the court did agree to postpone the trial of Georges Rutaganda, a businessman who allegedly organised massacres, until next March, by which time he is likely to be dead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akayesu's Belgian lawyer, Johan Scheers, alleges that his efforts to build a credible defence have been frustrated by inadequate information from the prosecution which has provided only 20 pages of evidence with large sections blacked out to protect the identity of witnesses. He says he has been unable to question witnesses in Rwanda and Zaire, and has not been paid the more than *10 000 in expenses owed by the tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scheers said he would appear before the court on Thursday to argue that the trial be postponed until these problems are resolved. But if the judges refuse to agree to a delay of several weeks, he would return to Belgium and leave Akayesu without a defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry, but in my opinion I am wasting my time here,&quot; Scheers said. &quot;I am prepared to attend the preliminary hearings and ask for a postponement.  But I am not prepared to undertake a defence of this case if I cannot put it together. I will leave next week and the court can decide what to do with the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal's spokeswoman, Beatrice la Coste, dismissed the lawyer's claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These defence lawyers have been paid their expenses. It cannot be said their work has been hampered because they have not received their expenses. I think these are just delaying tactics,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Scheers carries out his threat, it would leave Akayesu without a lawyer and the judges would have little choice but to put on hold a trial whose impact has already been diminished by long delays among a series of other problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwanda tribunal was born in the guilt- filled aftermath of the genocide with promises that it would help build reconciliation by forcing recognition of the scale of the crime against Tutsis while dividing the organisers of the slaughter from the broad Hutu population. Some also hoped that it might serve to restrain extremists in neighbouring Burundi who have embarked on their own ethnic slaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the international community gave strong vocal backing to the creation of the tribunal, the chief prosecutor, Judge Richard Goldstone, said it failed to follow up with cash. He complained that investigations were retarded by lack of resources, especially personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal's critics say funding was a major obstacle and they also portray Judge Goldstone as part of the problem. Some accuse him of subordinating Rwanda to the more politically sensitive Bosnia trials. Others say he took on Rwanda because he wanted to put his name to the foundation of a permanent international tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But inexperienced young human rights lawyers quickly became disillusioned by turf wars, lack of leadership inside Rwanda and a dispersed decision- making structure that took in four cities - New York, Arusha, the Hague and Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal's investigations were complicated when a number of the most notorious Hutu killers fell into the hands of various foreign governments.  Cases had to be put together much more rapidly than planned before the wanted men were released, forcing established investigations to be abandoned in favour of a more haphazard pursuit of witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides its internal problems, the tribunal was undermined by the obstruction of its investigations by several governments. France continues to harbour readily identifiable killers. But the largest pool of known leaders of the genocide are still free in Zaire, Kenya and parts of West Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Athletics South Africa (ASA), the body with overall responsibility for the sport in the country, tried to rig races for the forthcoming season involving Olympic 800m star Hezekiel Sepeng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has obtained a copy of a contract which ASA tried to get the silver medalist to sign, giving undertakings that he would not attempt to break the South African record in the 800m event except at meetings sponsored by the oil giant Engen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extraordinary document was prepared for the signature of South Africa's athletics supremo Bernard Rose - the chief executive officer of ASA - as well as Sepeng. Rose has not denied the existence or authenticity of the document.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sepeng, who was narrowly pipped to the gold medal in one of the most sensational 800m races in the history of the Olympic Games, refused to sign the contract. But one of his main rivals in South African athletics, Marius van Heerden - the then South African 800m record-holder - did sign an identical document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract was presented to Sepeng by ASA in April, three months before the Centennial Olympics. The document states that Sepeng should not race against Van Heerden over 800m except at the Old Mutual SA Track and Field Championships, the three Engen Grand Prix meetings in Pietersburg, Pretoria and Cape Town and the Pepsi All Africa International meeting in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also specifies that Sepeng should not attempt to break the South African 800m record except at the three Engen meetings. The agreement specifies various payments for competing in these events and a bonus schedule for specific time-based performances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clause 3 of the contract stipulates: &quot;It is agreed by the parties that Hezekiel may race the 800m in other Permit meetings, but that he will not attempt to break the South African record and that he will not race against Marius van Heerden over the 800m distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should ASA feel that Hezekiel has made an attempt on the 800m record (or he has in fact broken the record), then this agreement will be null and void and Hezekiel will repay to ASA any monies that have been paid to him in terms of this agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract goes on to give an undertaking that ASA will sign similar agreements with Van Heerden and the country's other Olympic 800m athlete Johan Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A later clause stipulates that the parties to the contract will keep it &quot; strictly private and confidential at all times&quot; and its contents &quot;will not be divulged to any third party for any reason whatsoever&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that when Sepeng was invited to meet ASA to discuss the contract, Rose told him that he could not bring any advisers. Sepeng refused to sign anything, however, without first discussing it with his coach &quot;JP&quot; van der Merwe. Botha also refused to sign. But Van Heerden - who was without a manager to advise him at the time - did sign, shortly after he broke the 25- year-old South African 800m record and after warnings that he risked being left out in the cold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rose denied the existence of the contract when first questioned about it by the M&amp;G this week. &quot;There is no contract between ASA and any athlete which says he must not break records,&quot; said the ASA chief executive. &quot;Nobody can stop an athlete from breaking records with a contract.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he was confronted with a copy of the draft contract, on an ASA letterhead, a clearly flustered Rose said: &quot;A piece of paper that is not signed by Hezekiel Sepeng has nothing to do with anything you are talking about.&quot; He said it was merely a &quot;starting point for negotiations&quot; with Sepeng.  Rose said a contract had since been signed with Sepeng which had satisfied all parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director general of the Department of Sport and Recreation, Mthobi Tyamzashe, said this week that the ASA contract amounted to &quot;a serious violation of the principles of fairness in sport&quot;. He said it was &quot;no different to the allegations against Bruce Grobelaar in British soccer and we know how seriously those allegations have been taken&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that &quot;in the next few days&quot; ASA would be given a chance to explain the draft contract. &quot;We will then see what steps need to be taken.&quot; He warned that any attempt to put pressure on the athletes in advance of a government inquiry &quot;will not be tolerated and will only exacerbate the situation&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This week the Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa denied that the countries' tobacco companies would voluntarily withdraw their advertising next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was speculated in advertising and marketing circles that this move, recently attempted by American tobacco companies, would pre-empt government legislation enforcing a total ban on cigarette advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, the proposed voluntary withdrawal of advertising to curtail the under-age use of tobacco products was rejected by Congress, which argued that the proposal by US tobacco companies fell short of its demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it was not planning to voluntarily withdraw tobacco advertising, the local tobacco institute said it would view a government ban as &quot;against the spirit of freemarket economy&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It argued that a ban on tobacco advertising would also be in &quot;violation&quot; of freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director of the Association of Marketeers Derrick Dickins said a discussion document on banning tobacco advertising had been circulated to &quot;selected parties&quot;, but neither his association nor the South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) had seen it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dickins said the Association of Marketeers and Sacob were &quot;in principle, totally opposed to any legislation that interfered with free-market processes&quot; . He added that the association was also opposed to government intervention in the advertising industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be &quot;contradictory&quot; to place restrictions on the advertising of a product (such as cigarettes), if that product can be legally sold, he said, adding that a ban could &quot;cause a big dent in the economy and result in large numbers of people being put out of work&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an advertising research company, the country's total adspend figures for the year ending June 1996 was about R4- billion - with tobacco advertising responsible for R166-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the total adspend was R4,2-billion with R168-million spent on tobacco advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Adindex 1996 figures, tobacco advertising accounted for 19,6% of adspend in the magazine industry compared with 30% for newspapers. For 1995, the figures were 17% and 37% respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's Adindex figures indicated that 42% of adspend in print media was related to tobacco products, while radio was responsible for 37% of tobacco advertising. Tobacco adspend in print and radio showed a 5% rise since last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's media would be &quot;hard-hit&quot; by a ban as the sector relied heavily on tobacco advertising, Dickins said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of the emerging community radio stations fighting for a piece of the shrinking advertising pie, it would be a death blow if tobacco advertising were banned, Dickins warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talib Sadic, the SABC's chief finance executive, said advertising on the South African Broadcasting Corporation's radio stations was aimed mostly at white, coloured and Indian audiences, with advertisers spending a lot less on African language broadcasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African language stations are already battling and could not afford a cut in advertising revenue, Sadic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising manager of National Magazines Limited (Natmags) Henry van Rensburg argued that legislation permitting a ban on tobacco products could cause some advertising agencies to shut down as tobacco advertising formed a substantial portion of their ad revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although economically detrimental, Van Rensburg said restrictions on tobacco advertising were part of a global trend and were inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natmags therefore regarded tobacco advertising as a &quot;volatile&quot; source of revenue and would no longer include it in their forecasts of projected advertising turnover, Van Rensburg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of going to press, the relevant health officials had not responded regarding the state of legislation to ban tobacco advertising. But the director of the National Council Against Smoking, Yusuf Saloojee, citing recent consultation with the ministry, said he was aware that it was being &quot; seriously considered&quot; although he had no knowledge of a discussion document in circulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that support for this move was growing within the government and the anti- smoking lobby was pressing for legislation placing a total ban on tobacco advertising, in line with the World Health Organisation's recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anti-smoking lobby would oppose any compromise in the form of voluntary agreements to withdraw or reduce tobacco advertising by tobacco companies, said Saloojee. &quot;These types of arguments left too many loopholes,&quot; he argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that if the government put 20c more tax on a pack of 20, it would amount to R200-million extra revenue that could be used to establish a health promotion fund that could place advertisements in the media promoting a healthy lifestyle - thus acting as a buffer for losses in tobacco adspend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Dickins discounted Saloojee's tax proposal as a viable solution, saying it was based on inaccurate accounting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is caught between a rock and a hard place with a mandate tailored to serve the needs of a diverse audience, but a lack of funds to fulfill this goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mandate has put financial pressure on radio stations still under the SABC's control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC general manager for corporate communications Enoch Sithole says the mandate issued to the corporation by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) - and approved by the government - although &quot;necessary&quot;, needed some form of financial backing from the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The upgrading of SABC radio stations is imperative, but money is the crucial issue if the mandate is to be fulfilled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was told to us that our 16 radio stations have to increase their local content, broadcast more news and current affairs programmes and concentrate on educational material. All these additional briefs issued by the IBA and the government mean the SABC is in dire need of money,'' says Sithole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC radio services chief executive Govin Reddy was quoted earlier this week as saying that the government had two choices: either to fund the deficit, or to allow the SABC to keep the money generated from the sale of its six regional radio stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alternative, Reddy said, was to cut down the public broadcaster's mandate as the corporation was considering shutting down some of its African language broadcasts in a bid to compensate for revenue lost following the privatisation of its six radio stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Sithole disagrees with Reddy. He argues that the axing of African language radio stations is &quot;definitely not on the cards&quot; as the radio sales funds &quot;will be forthcoming&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am confident that the government will hand over the funds generated from the privatisation process of the radio stations. The question is how much will be handed over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sithole says the IBA and the government have &quot;acknowledged&quot; that the SABC is in financial difficulty, adding that the Post, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Ministry has agreed to introduce new legislation next year, allowing the government to fund the SABC in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the finer details of the exact nature of funding still need to be thrashed out, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relaunch of the SABC radio stations on Saturday is therefore timely, argues Sithole, as the repositioning will be followed by financial aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Active marketing director, Ken Modise, agrees. The radio stations' relaunch, conducted to the tune of R3-million, is &quot;extremely cost-effective&quot;, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modise explains that the bulk of the money will be used to pay for the hiring of the Johannesburg Stadium where the relaunch party will be held on Saturday, as well as to pay for the artists who will perform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the cost is also owing to the marketing strategies which involve redesigning logos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To change the names of 10 language-based radio stations for R3-million is cheap when compared with market-related costs,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Modise is not as confident as Sithole regarding government funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modise argues that the majority of radio stations are unable to cover their costs and with increased demands being placed on the SABC to upgrade language- based stations, the corporation may be forced to close down its non- profitable operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modise says only about four of the 16 radio stations are profitable, with the rest, although generating revenue, incapable of sustaining themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is clear if push comes to shove, and a pure business decision has to be made, then these radio stations that cannot cover their own costs, will have to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the SABC is in a difficult position because it is not our decision to decide the future fate of these stations. The decision lies with the government and the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Britain is squeezing cash out of the world's poorest countries by demanding levels of debt repayment far outweighing new loans or aid, according to figures published this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As representatives of the world's richest creditor nations met in Paris on Monday to discuss initiatives intended to reduce the debt burden on the developing world, aid agencies say the first comprehensive analysis of lender countries undermines the British government's claim to be at the forefront of the campaign to help the world's poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative for Christian Aid said: &quot;It is quite simply morally wrong that one of the world's richest countries should be getting more money out of the world's poorest than it puts in. The very last thing these countries need is to be shelling out like this.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad) - a Brussels-based umbrella group including Christian Aid, Cafod and Oxfam - has undertaken the first country-by-country survey of the main creditor nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A copy of the research shows Britain has been a net recipient of cash from the Third World since 1981. The paper shows that, of the nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), only the United States has a longer record of taking more money from the developing world than it gives out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures will add to pressure on the OECD member states to relax repayment schedules. The World Bank is trying to squeeze a commitment to more generous debt relief before the bank's annual meeting in Washington next week, where a British-backed package to help &quot;heavily indebted poor countries&quot; (HIPCs) will be on the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Christian Aid representative said: &quot;This study throws into stark relief just how much needs to be achieved in the next week. Britain has a good record of taking the lead in negotiations, but in the end we have to put our money where our mouth is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official at the Overseas Development Agency declined to comment on the Eurodad report before publication, but insisted the British government had a good record on aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Minister Kenneth Clarke is prepared to increase the slice of outstanding loans that can be written off - now fixed at 67% - to 80 or 90%.  But a number of lenders, in particular Japan, have refused to offer anything more than the possibility of more generous relief on a case by case basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An announcement on the HIPC initiative involving a trust fund to pay off debts is expected in Washington next week. The World Bank is lobbying the OECD nations for a more concrete commitment on cuts in bilateral debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank has pledged $2-billion to the HIPC initiative. But officials point out that the eligibility criteria stipulate that only debt accumulated before any loan rescheduling is eligible for relief. This would rule out many of the world's poorest nations from significant assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An internal World Bank paper issued this month estimates that even with an 80% cut- off, the eligibility rules mean that in practice only 17% of bilateral debt could be written off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian Aid said that because many of the loans to poor countries were conditional on the purchase of British goods, Britain gained twice over. &quot;We benefit from the increased exports, and then again from the interest on the loans given to buy these exports.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Zukile Nomvete is working himself out of a job. If at the end of five years he is still leading the transformation of South African Airways (SAA), he believes he will have failed - not only himself, but also his staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appointed to his role as Transnet executive director of airways and properties in April, for a five-year period, Nomvete will be responsible for the strategic direction and policy decisions for the airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete is no newcomer to the aviation industry, having started out as a &quot; grease monkey&quot; with Aer Lingus in Ireland, after fleeing South Africa during the 1976 riots. His climb through the ranks of the aviation industry, he feels, will be beneficial not only to SAA, but to himself and his employees as he leads the airline into the next century.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With asset holdings of R14-billion, the parastatal is facing a three- pronged challenge from privatisation, increased competition and the government's on-going process of transformation of the broader society of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For SAA to survive, it is not just a question of affirmative action, but for the airline to take cognisance of the fact that it is now a global player in a global market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The transformation of SAA is about the employees of the company taking responsibility and accountability for their decisions from the lowest level through to management.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete says the biggest hurdle he has faced since joining the organisation is the sense of despair among the airline employees - a hangover from the old days of a hierarchical management structure that needs to be changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This low morale comes on the heels of increased competition in both the international and domestic sectors of its operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mistrust about the future, dissatisfaction at our on-board services and an unsatisfactory on-time departure record are some of the factors that have contributed to low morale within the organisation,&quot; believes Nomvete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The employees of SAA need to take ownership of the company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete does realise there are fears and concerns about the transformation process. But, in order for the airline to survive and succeed, it is going to have to be continuously innovative and undergo a significant overhaul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Nomvete, the rationale behind the transformation of the airline is so the company can expand its share of the cake. &quot;Then the threat is not really affirmative action, but whether we can expand our market share so everyone can benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to start utilising our resources to optimum advantage. If I were just motivated by profits, half the employees needn't be here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The threat of privatisation and increased competition form part of the front that Nomvete would like to see tackled within the broader transformation of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to be able to offer a competitive and comparative world class service. To achieve this we have to address the service levels and the product we offer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a practical level, Nomvete would like to see a change in the attitude of staff, cabin layout, and increased efficiency. &quot;By March of next financial year, we must, out of necessity, have a completely different airline in how it looks and feels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAA recently hired the services of London- based consultant SBC Warburg in co-operation with two local accounting firms - Kessel Feinstein and NN Gobodo &amp; Company - to guide and assist management with strategic business issues facing the airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This valuation is regarded as an important exercise and the results obtained will serve as key inputs in determining the future strategic direction of the airline,&quot; Nomvete said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an indication of the commitment of management to rise to the challenge of increased competition, both domestic and local.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of the privatisation of SAA, as far as he is concerned, is solely the prerogative of the shareholder - in this case, the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the shareholder says do it tomorrow, I will duly make my input. Of course there are various task forces looking at the issue. My job is to serve the shareholder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as placing SAA firmly in the black is concerned, Nomvete believes the airline needs to implement a sound business plan with a vision for the next 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will not involve cost-cutting, rather, cost consciousness,&quot; says Nomvete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In line with this belief, Nomvete says, the airline will have to focus on its core business - the transport of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to work jointly with our neighbours in the sub-region, realising we cannot all afford to have a different fleet mix and equipment. We will have to rationalise, it is ridiculous; nobody will be able to survive,&quot; if the present situation continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete would prefer to see a strategic alliance with the national airlines in Southern Africa, where maybe two or three major hubs, such as Johannesburg, would serve the entire market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This alliance need not only be within the airline industry, but should extend into the entire tourism sector. Nomvete wants all stakeholders to become involved in the marketing of tourism in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this route lies the key to SAA's successful transformation, he believes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAA reported an increase in both turnover and profit for the financial year end 1995/96 this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internal and external turnover rose from R3,999-billion in 1994/95 to R5, 013-billion in 1995/96. The company saw its net profit after finance costs increase from R217- million to R324-million for the financial year 1995/96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leon Els, a representative for SAA, said the increase in the airline's profits came on the back of an upswing in tourism to South Africa and the influx of rugby spectators for the Rugby World Cup last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline had also been involved in a cost-cutting exercise that saw the rationalisation of a number of international and domestic routes and the closing of offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the airline was expecting to post a profit for the financial year 1996/97, but it didn't believe the upswing would continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Els said SAA had been hard hit by the weakening rand, which had resulted in an increase of aircraft landing and fuel costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been a downswing in the first quarter of this financial year,&quot; said Els.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the acquisition of further new aircraft, SAA said it had a &quot;good understanding&quot; with supplier Boeing and purchases would be made if and when required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Nomvete: &quot;Budgetary cutbacks in difficult times are a short-term solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The European Commission has not blocked a $74-million loan to the Saldanha Steel project, merely reserved judgment, says Erwan Four, the European Union's ambassador to South Africa. The EC has sent the file back to the European Investment Bank, says Four, for further consideration; the EIB will review the issue and then decide whether to go ahead at a later stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussions between the EIB and Saldanha Steel have been going on for months, says Saldanha's executive chairman Bernard Smith, but he has still not heard through official channels why the loan was sent back to the drawing- board. Even so, the company did not budget for it, so if it falls away, it &quot; will be unfortunate, but not the end of the world&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the world's biggest player on the capital markets, the EIB can command very advantageous lending rates; as a result, every potential loan has to be thoroughly investigated. But before a decision can be taken, all loan considerations have to be rubber-stamped by the EC, and there is speculation that a faction within the commission is balking at the prospect of lending to a potential competitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the European steel industry has been going through a difficult restructuring, resulting in significant lay- offs, so it may not be politic to lend to a competitor outside the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, says Four, steel would form part of the free trade agreement with South Africa. Talks are currently stalled by South Africa's objections to the EU's stand on agricultural products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very keen to discuss the nitty- gritty of the free trade agreement as soon as possible,&quot; says Four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to send a clear message to potential investors, both in Europe and South Africa, about our future trade relations, and the quicker we reach a clear agreement, the stronger the message to business partners,&quot; says Four.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Cyril Ramaphosa is tipped to become the next chairman of national power supplier Eskom when the present incumbent, John Maree, steps down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief executive officer of the parastatal, Allan Morgan, confirmed this week it would be &quot;good speculation&quot; to say Ramaphosa will succeed Maree when the government decides to appoint a new Electricity Council chairman. He stressed the appointment of a new chairman was an executive decision to be approved by Cabinet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maree, who was abroad this week, has made no official comment about leaving, but Eskom officials say there has been much speculation about his imminent departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appointment would represent a fascinating twist in the career of the Ramaphosa, who quit full-time politics six months ago and started his business career by steering the country's biggest black empowerment deal to date - the acquisition of a stake in Johnnic by the National Empowerment Consortium (NEC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would also mean a return to his roots: the strongest union at Eskom is the National Union of Mineworkers, in the service of which Ramaphosa developed his legendary negotiating skills. His former colleague, NUM assistant general manager Gwede Mantashe, is already on the Eskom board, or Eskom &quot;Council&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood senior officials at Eskom are particularly keen to have Ramaphosa on board. President Nelson Mandela is said to approve of the move, but it remains unclear whether Deputy President Thabo Mbeki backs it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau's office refused to either confirm or deny Ramaphosa had been approached. A representative said Sigcau would submit a list of new Eskom councillors to Cabinet in the next couple of weeks. He said a new chairman could be picked from this list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possibility of Ramaphosa taking the job was broached last year when he was still in politics, but became a more serious option with his move into the business world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The job as chairman is part-time - Maree, who also heads Nedcor, spends two or three days a week at Eskom - which means Ramaphosa will be able to continue as deputy chairman of New Africa Investments Limited, the lead company in the NEC. The NEC's next task requiring his negotiating skills is a stake in Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, likely this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom is considered the most efficient and well-run of South Africa's major parastatals - with the help of the relatively cheap funding it obtained for its massive infrastructure and scant restrictions on power station emissions.  It has far fewer problems facing it than transport parastatal Transnet, which is held back by its massive pension fund deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Ramaphosa - currently wrapping up his work as Constitutional Assembly president - becomes chairman, he will join the parastatal as it starts gearing up some of its divisions for privatisation. However, industry observers say the energy supplier's privatisation will not take place before the next election, particularly because of Eskom's crucial contribution to the Reconstruction and Development Programme through its mass electrification drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some senior Eskom officials have recently made pro-privatisation noises out of line with statements from the government, fuelling the impression that Eskom is less in step with the new regime than it was with the old government.  This would explain their enthusiasm for having Ramaphosa on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unlikely that Ramaphosa will be associated with Eskom when the government begins selling it off in earnest. For as observers noted this week, one of the best reasons for Ramaphosa taking the job would be its proximity to the government, easing his return to politics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Saturday 14 saw a fifteen-member economic delegation leave for a tour of Kuwait and Japan. Lead by prime minister Meles Zenawi, the delegation is visiting, by invitation, to discuss investment, trade and other related issues with heads of government and counterparts in various fields of the economic sector, said ENA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group includes about 50 exporters of coffee, hides and skins, fruit and vegetables, oil seeds and marble and textile. It was said that the purpose of the trip is to further enhance the already strong bond between the two countries and Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During talks held on Monday, Kuwaiti Head of State, Sheikh Jabir AlAhmed Al- Jabir and Crown Prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdella Al-Sabah, Prime Minister Meles showed readiness to create strong and mutually benefiting ties in the fields of trade, science and technology.  As a result, the two countries signed co- operation agreements believed to abolish double taxation and to lay the legal foundation of investment relations between Ethiopia and Kuwait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, in Japan, a $16.5 million agreement was signed to assist in the production of food grain and improving telephone cables in Addis Ababa.  Meanwhile Prime Minister Meles attended and talked with the &quot;Ethiopian Friends Association&quot; in Japan.</SPAN></P>

However after 1984, the infant mortality rate and under-five mortality rate have steadily increased, while life expectancy at birth has decreased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unofficial figures quoted indicate that the current infant mortality rate of 101/1000, under-five mortality rate of 152/1000 and maternal mortality rate of 700/100,000 live births, all indicate the poor health status of children, and women in Ethiopia. In some ways this is not surprising in a country where 84 per cent of woman receive no antenatal care and only less than 10 per cent of children have access to health and medical care. Even where there is access to health and medical care, patients, mothers and children are treated with negligence and carelessness. In a recent bureaucratic bungle, a pregnant women was transferred from one hospital to another. The second hospital did not know why she was moved and in a tragic conclusion, both mother and child died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently, the available health services capacity of about 45 per cent coverage of the population consists of 89 hospitals with 12,000 beds (i.e.  one bed for more than 4,000 people), 160 health centers, 2, 292 health stations and over 11, 000 community health posts. The annual per capita recurrent health budget is about 10 birr and nearly 70 per cent of this spent on salaries, leaving very little to cover operational costs and drugs. Low health care coverage, inefficiency of the available health facilities and under utilization of these services have all undermined the opportunity to curb health problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia is one of the least developed countries. The health dimensions of todays complex social problems call for a multifaceted response that is not restricted to medical solutions. Strategies that address health problems will also need to be related to the other major social problems of the decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health status gaps between regions mirror the unequal development of health infrastructure that varies both by population group and by community within our country. Ethiopia needs to define health policies that take into consideration the complex interaction of factors at play evolving political and economic environment. The health and well-being of people, particularly the poor and the marginalized should be the main target of such policies aiming , in the long term , at self-reliance and sustainable development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - In a special report issued by the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO) dated September 17, the Administration in Addis Ababa, or Region 14, came under fire for allegedly using powers it does not possess.  The dispute began when the region sharply raised the rent of Kebele houses in which businesses are run as well as shops and market plots controlled by the region itself. The report stated &quot;Ato Tefera Waluwa, Chairman of the Addis Ababa Regional Council, told government journalists during a press conference that the rent of a house which used to be 25 birr a month has now been raised to 5000 birr and that houses which were rented from the Kebeles and then sublet to others have been taken away from the original tenants together with the businesses and let to the sub-lessee under a new contract signed with the Kebeles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the report said, &quot;the law by which Region 14 was established has been annulled by the Federal Constitution and hence Addis Ababa is no more a separate administrative region... Therefore, the Council of Region 14 has no legal basis and as such has no legal power to take any measure in the name of the city of Addis Ababa.&quot; EHRCO went on to say that according to Article 20(5) of Proclamation No. 47/75, &quot;the power to administer and collect the fees of nationalized houses whose monthly rents fell below 100 birr was given to the Kebeles and the rest to the Agency for Rental House Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new directive of Addis Ababa Administration, is contrary to international and national human rights laws, in particular &quot;the right to work&quot;. The report said the rise in rent does not take into account the financial capacity of the petty traders. It cited one case where &quot;Ato Toye Dibaga makes his living by selling spices in Woreda 5, Kebele 17, House no.  57. He used to pay 6 birr a month for the rent of the house during the regime of Emperor Haile Sellassie. The rent was reduced to 3 birr by the Proclamation No. 47/75, but now he is asked to pay 171.45 birr a month. Since he can't afford to pay this, he says he will either go begging or migrate elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Effective as of September 16, 1996, the National Bank of Ethiopia (the country's central bank) has cut the deposit interest rate from a prescribed minimum of 10 percent to 7 percent and the lending interest rate from a maximum of 15 percent to 10.5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two arithmetical features of the action taken by the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) are immediately noticeable: the magnitude of the interest rate reduction (30 percent) is substantial; the spread between the maximum lending rate and the minimum deposit rate has been narrowed down from the previous 5 percent to 3.5 percent or by 30 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why have the interest rates been reduced? One important reason is the officially reported low rate of inflation at present. The general retail price index in July 1996 (the latest available at the time of writing) for Addis Ababa reported by the Central Statistical Authority stood at 960.7 as against 1015.6 in July 1995, showing a decline of 5.7 percent. Comparing the average general indices for the January-July periods of 1995 and 1996, the rate of inflation registered a drop of 3.9 percent. So, the official inflation statistics indicate that the rate of inflation is negative or that prices are actually falling. This may sound incredible to the average person in Addis Ababa who, apart form the long-standing, rising house rents on the free market, is currently experiencing a substantial rise in sugar and restaurant food prices. But that is what the official figures are showing and we don't have any alternative set of figures to resort to at the moment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Very simply, the connection between the rate of interest and the rate of inflation is as follows: A person who lends another person his money should be able to earn something more than the rate of inflation on his loan: otherwise, upon repayment his money would be worth less than what it was at the time he lent it out. Assume the loan amount is 1000 birr and the annual rate of inflation is 20 percent. If the annual rate of interest on the loan is only 15 percent, that is 5 percent less than the rate of inflation, the creditor's loan money plus interest would be 1150 birr if repaid a year later, but when discounted by the 20 percent rate of inflation, it would amount to only 920 birr, i.e. 80 birr less than the original 1000 birr loan extended, which obviously would be a loss to the lender. Hence, the lender must get something appreciably more than the rate of inflation in order to be induced to lend his money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That essentially is presumed to be one of the justifications behind the NBE's move to reduce the deposit and lending rates. The rate of inflation in 1995 as compared to 1994 was 10 percent. So in 1995 (as of November 1995) the minimum deposit rate was raised to 11 percent and the maximum lending rate was set at 16 percent, indicating an interest rate / inflation rate differential of only 1 percent on the deposit side and a much higher differential of 6 percent on the bank lending side. Now, the official statistics show that prices have fallen so far by around 4 percent, which would mean that even at the substantially reduced bank deposit and lending rates differentials are a huge 11 percent and 14.5 percent, respectively.  Hence, the upswing in the differentials has been massive because of the downswing in the rate of inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ideally, the rate of interest as the cost of money should be determined, much like any other price, by the forces of demand and supply, but this is not entirely the case even in developed countries. The rate of interest is now being used as a major policy instrument in West Germany, the U.K. and the United States and several other economically advanced countries. One of the basic reasons why it would not be prudent to leave the determination of the rate of interest entirely to market forces is that in the context of reasonable free and fair competition, banks would be inclined to keep on cutting their lending rates and their margins in the hope of attracting more borrowers and in the belief that what they lose on lower lending rates, they could make up for on business turnover, but although this may be a sound business strategy at the micro level, its macro consequence could well be disastrous, with the possibility of disruptive hyperinflation resulting from economic overheating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the rate of interest should not be allowed to be too remotely divorced from he scarcity price of money (capital) signaled by market forces. In Ethiopia, the major loan capital market is provided by the banking system and here the rates of interest are administratively set by the monetary authorities. The closest loan capital markets come to being governed by the forces of demand and supply in Ethiopia is on the treasury bills auction market. The rate of interest on the treasury bills market is essentially determined by auction and currently the annualized rate is below 5 percent. On the informal credit market, the annual rate of interest could be as high as 200 percent on a compound basis. Here lack of information on alternative sources, partly resulting from its informal nature; the atmosphere of illegality associated with informal money-lending and the presumed high risk element involved in it are some of the major factors contributing to the usurious rates of interest charged. By contrast, no interest is levied on credits provided through the savings pools of the traditional savings associations of &quot;Ekubs&quot;. As a recapitulation, let us enumerate the lending rates charged on the various major non-traditional and traditional credit markets in Ethiopia as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit market Lending interest rate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">( in percent )</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial banks 10.5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">treasury bills auction market 4.1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savings and credit cooperatives 10.5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit unions 10.5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">informal money-lending 200 (approximate)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekubs nil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The maximum lending rate charged by Commercial banks, savings and credit cooperatives and credit unions are more or less administratively fixed.  Theoretically, they could charge anything less than this maximum rate (latest) , but in actual practice there has been no significant trend in that direction for fear of negatively affecting interest margins, which are partly determined by the minimum deposit rates administratively fixed. The 200 percent lending rate on the informal credit market could hardly be viewed as having been market-determined because of the rather &quot;unmarked&quot; mode of its operations, not least its illicit characteristics. Of all the credit markets, perhaps the rate on treasury bills auction market is the one that comes closest to being genuinely market-determined. However, the even here participation is limited to big institutional investors with idle money such as the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, the Social Security Authority, the Ethiopian Electric light and Power Authority and the Ethiopian Insurance Company. Restricted though the treasury bills market may be the procedure by which the rate of interest is determined is fairly market oriented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at the Ethiopian financial macro-economy, there appears to be a major contradiction at least on the basis of official statistics: on the one hand, there is reported to be a colossal amount of excess liquidity in the banking system and elsewhere (for example, in institutions bidding on the treasury bills auction). For instance, the excess reserves of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, the largest retail bank in the country, was reported to be over 750 million birr as of April 1996. On the other hand, Ethiopia's saving rate officially estimated at about 5 percent is one of the lowest in the world and hardly bears comparison with the average of over 35 percent for East Asian counties. On the evidence of the reported excess liquidity (or savings), the bank deposit rate should in fact be lower than the minimum rate of 7 percent to which the NBE has just reduced it; as a matter of fact, it should perhaps be well below 4 percent, which is the rate at which, say, the Commercial bank of Ethiopia is lending its excess reserves to the government; on the evidence of the low domestic saving ratio, the bank deposit rate should perhaps be where it was before the latest interest rate reduction, i.e.  around 10 percent or more. This is quite a dilemma for the monetary authorities in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excess liquidity is one sign that investment activity is low overall. Low overall investment activity is in turn an indication that the investment climate is not favorable. So, something should be done about that. In the meantime, however, the rate of interest should reflect the demand/supply situation on the financial market. Right now even the 7 percent rate of interest on bank deposits appears to be on the high side, considering the reported amount of excess liquidity. On the other hand, in view of the very sluggish nature of investment at present, there is every reason to reduce lending interest rates even further in order to stimulate investment activity, at least from the financial point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the question of what the margin between the deposit and lending rates of interest should be, percentage profit margins and total business turnover in other business activities should be examined for comparison with the situation in the banking business. For example, the precious 5% margin between deposit and lending interest rates represented a gross percentage interest profit margin of about 50 percent, taking into account only interest- bearing deposits. Taking into consideration demand deposits which bear no interest, the margin would be much higher, perhaps as high as 200 percent.  Assuming that the weighted deposit rate is now about 3.5 percent (i.e. taking into account the zero rate of interest rate on demand deposits), the absolute interest rate margin between this weighted rate and the maximum lending rate of 10.5 percent prescribed by the NBE would be 7 percent and the relative interest profit margin would be 200 percent, which means the reduction in the absolute interest margin from 5 percent to 3.5 percent may not adversely affect the profitability of banks on their interest account in relative terms.  In fact, substantial absolute gains may be made if the reduced lending rate spurs lending activity. If, however, such expansion of turnover fails to materialize, the reduced absolute interest rate margin would negatively affect bank profitability in absolute terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To summarize, the major effects of NBE's action to reduce interest rates would be the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* bank depositors would be hurt by the loss of interest income, but the reduction in the deposit rate would not significantly discourage savers from depositing money in the banking system as the 7% deposit rate is considered to be still high enough in the current financial circumstances;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* bank lending may be stimulated as a result of the reduction in the lending rate, especially in the now depressed housing construction sector;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the profitability of the banking sector in relative terms is not likely to be adversely affected in any significant way; in fact, gains could be made from higher turnover on lending activities; however, lack of such business turnover may negatively affect bank profitability in absolute terms;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* inflationary tendencies may re-emerge with higher lending activity, especially if existing investment bottlenecks such as land and infrastructure unavailability are removed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Malawi's Inspector General of Police, Patrick Chikapa, must be regretting convening a press conference on September 2 to clarify the arrest a day earlier of MCP treasurer general John Tembo, his son John Jr, and former official hostess for ex-president Hastings Banda, Cecilia Kadzamira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the intention of the press conference was good, the mistake Chikapa will probably live to regret, and which surprised members of the press, was when they found that two of the people the police had announced two days earlier had been arrested in connection with the January Kalaria Wholesale broad daylight armed robbery, were also there, both seemingly composed and relaxed. These were Chimwemwe Mputahelo, a former editor of the defunct Malawian newspaper, an abhorred critic of State President Bakili Muluzi, and Adamson Chunga, John Tembo's former driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chikapa's brief introductory remarks, detailing the press conference and the presence of the two accused persons, only set the tempo for scepticism and doubt among the pressmen and triggered a set of probing questions most of which seemingly proved too hot for the police to handle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One journalist said he felt the press conference was a kangaroo court of some type aimed at condemning the Tembos, who were not there and able to defend themselves from being unfairly accused by Chunga and Mputahelo.  Chikapa did not agree with the journalist's question, but it was clear he had been taken by surprise. He argued there was no need to produce the masterminds behind the conspiracy to murder and attempted murder charges. &quot; When the investigations are over all the accused will be tried in a court of law,&quot; he argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chikapa gave a vague excuse: &quot;These people are still helping us with investigations,&quot; without telling the press whether the two would be tried for being hired as marksmen in the conspiracy. Again when the suggestion was made to him that the manner in which the events have unfolded since the initial announcement on 31 August could not be coincidence, the police boss was again at a loss to give a convincing explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When another reporter wanted to know why the government always rushes to arrest MCP cadres while it hesitates or drags its feet when there is need to arrest UDF leaders involved in matters of contempt of court, financial scandals, corruption or evading customs, Chikapa pleaded that such issues should not be mixed with the purpose of the press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When MBC aired the press conference, attended by Chief Information Officer, Grey Mang'anda, Principal Secretary for Information and Broadcasting Ziddy Medi and MBC Acting Director General Sam Gunde, later in the evening, all those issues on which the police and the two marksmen had failed to answer convincingly had been removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Cecilia Kadzamira on September 3 expressed concern over her incarceration by the UDF government, but vowed never to leave the former head of state. She had been granted bail after a 24-hour stint in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe the government wants me to join politics,&quot; said Kadzamira, when she addressed over 200 supporters at Banda's official residence at Mudi House. &quot; What I see is that they want to arrest the Ngwazi. They are not content with what they did to us during the Mwanza case,&quot; she said. She vowed &quot;never to leave the Ngwazi&quot; in spite of the harassment by the UDF government. &quot;We have always kept peace and calm and abided by the four corner-stones yet UDF thinks we are stupid. But they should not forget that a shy and stupid snake bites from the tail,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking of her stint in prison, a seemingly tired but smiling Kadzamira said she was well received and treated by female inmates at Chichiri prison who, she said, also sent a message of solidarity to the opposition MCP.  Cecilia Kadzamira was granted bail on September 3 less than 48 hours after her arrest on charges of conspiring to murder three UDF cabinet ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bail was granted by Judge Duncan Tambala who said people should not use detention to punish suspects before trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LATE NEWS --- JOHN TEMBO AND SON RELEASED: MCP strongman John Tembo and his son by the same names, John charged with conspiracy to murder and attempted murder were given bail on September 4. The two were arrested on September 1 following confessions by three accused persons in a shooting incident that took place in Lilongwe in January 1996 incriminating them. The Tembos must report to police once every two months. The bail carries a bond of K20,000, non-cash and another surety of K20,000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - PATEL RESIGNS FROM UDF: A founding executive member of the UDF, and former cabinet minister, Rolf Patel, announced his resignation from the party on September 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patel, proprietor of Uniprint, which has been sued by President Bakili Muluzi for printing a newspaper with a libellous article, has not yet joined another party. He is an MP in Thyolo, southern Malawi. He may remain an MP as long as he does not join another political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He fell out of favour with Muluzi and his cabinet, along with a group of ten other members of parliament, for openly criticising Muluzi on a number of issues. Patel, who was then minister of energy and mining, was changed to the less prestigious portfolio of relief and rehabilitation. In a reshuffle two months later, Muluzi dropped him completely from the cabinet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patel says there is rampant corruption in the Muluzi government with some cabinet ministers , who previously could not afford the busfare from town to their homes , now owning mansions and fleets of vehicles. &quot;How could anyone accumulate such wealth within the two years they have been cabinet ministers?' queried Patel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patel is the second MP to resign from the party, Fred Nseula from Mwanza being the first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE ARREST KADZAMIRA AND TEMBO: Police have announced the arrest of opposition MCP Treasurer General John Tembo, his son, John Tembo Jr and former president Kamuzu Banda's confidante, Cecilia Kadzamira, for their alleged role in a conspiracy to murder, and for attempted murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police announced on 2 September that the three, and a former police officer, Thunga, were arrested following the confessions of three other people already in police custody in connection with the robbery in January this year of a wholesale shop in Lilongwe. The three are former editor of The Malawian newspaper, Chimwemwe Mputahero, Adamson Chunga and William Phakamisa, arrested 31 August. They were using John Tembo Jr's vehicle.Tembo Jr told the police, his car had been borrowed by Chunga, one of his employees, because he wanted to go a funeral in Lilongwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police did not disclose details of the confessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MALAWI BEMOANS TRADE PROTOCOL: For some time, the Malawi government has held the strong opinion that it would benefit if it forged special trade agreements with its neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a view culminated in Malawi signing one such trade agreement with Zimbabwe in October 1995. The agreement provides duty free access of imports and exports of finished products between the two countries. But now, barely ten months after Malawi signed the agreement, the business community is crying foul and would like to have the agreement cancelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has come under fire from the business community through its spokesman, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI), for rushing into the trade protocol without consulting the private sector. MCCI Executive Director says since signing the Malawi/Zimbabwe trade agreement, Malawi's exports to Zimbabwe have plummeted. Zimbabwe's exports to Malawi have, however, increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make matters worse, Zimbabweans have taken advantage of Malawi's poor industrial base by fully utilising the trade agreement to penetrate the Malawian market with their cheaper goods, allowed duty free access under the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting by the chamber on August 29, the business community urged the government to waive duty on importation of a number of raw materials in order to reduce production costs by manufacturers which would then make the products more competitive, locally and internationally. The community feels that unless the government provides incentives to the industrial sector, Malawi will continue to suffer trade imbalance from Zimbabwe which is benefiting from the trade protocol because of its strong industrial base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The private sector argues that because of the agreement, Zimbabwean products have become much cheaper than local ones. One businessman said it would even be profitable for Malawians to manufacture in Zimbabwe and export to Malawi. &quot;Traders are even importing chickens and eggs at much cheaper prices than locally produced ones,&quot; lamented a poultry feed milling company.  Zimbabwe, unlike Malawi, does not charge duty on importation of stock feed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controller of Customs and Excise, Ernest Mtingwi, rules out the possibility of removing duty on import of raw materials saying this would cripple government revenue collection. More than 50% of Malawi's budget is funded by revenue from customs and excise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VEEP THREATENS PRINCIPAL SECRETARIES, DISTRICT COMMISSIONERS: Vice President Justin Malewezi has threatened to fire principal secretaries and district commissioners who do not support the United Democratic Front (UDF) government. He was speaking last week, at the installation of Bibi Abiti Chapola as Chief in Salima, central Malawi, about 70 kilometres east of the capital Lilongwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the UDF had discovered that there were some district commissioners and principal secretaries in the government supporting the opposition parties, MCP and AFORD. He threatened that any civil servant who does not support the government will have their services terminated or be retired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AK 47, PISTOLS IN CAR CRASH, DIPLOMAT'S DAUGHTER AMONG THREE DEAD: A diplomat's daughter was among three dead in a car crash, and an AK 47 assault rifle, two pistols and several fake vehicle number plates were retrieved from the vehicle giving rise to suspicion that the victims were car thieves.  Ntcheu Chief Superintendent of Police, Patrick Phiri said the accident happened last week, in Ntcheu, central Malawi, about 200 kms from Blantyre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trancy Malemena, daughter of an administrator at the Zambian High Commission in Lilongwe, was the only female in the hired car, which was being driven by a Malawian, Joseph Sayani. The other passenger, Manete was a Zairean refugee based at Dzaleka camp in central Malawi. The vehicle, which overturned four times when the driver failed to negotiate a corner, had different number plates at the front and rear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is rampant car theft in Malawi, with most of vehicles stolen ending up in Zaire, where there is said to be a ready market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIAN HEMP TRAFFICKER INTERCEPTED: Following a tip, police in Nkhota-kota, central Malawi, on August 23 intercepted a minibus carrying 15 and a half bags of Indian hemp (locally known as chamba), each weighing 90 kgs. All but one person in the minibus fled with police apprehending the one man who did not run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Muluzi set up a fund a few months ago to reward people tipping the police in chamba dealing. Nkhota-kota, along Lake Malawi, is reputed to be the biggest supplier of chamba in Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bakili Muluzi, who attended a SADC summit on August 24 in Lesotho at which several protocols were signed, including one on drug trafficking, afterwards warned that the law on chamba dealing would become tougher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE TEAR-GAS MARCHERS: Riot police in Blantyre on September 3 used tear- gas to disperse more than 300 demonstrators carrying anti-MCP placards, marching from Blantyre city centre to the High Court about five kilometres away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marchers said they were going to the High Court to petition the Chief Justice and demand that Judge Mackson Mkandawire should not preside over the case involving John Tembo, his son, John Jr, Cecilia Kadzamira and a former police man, Thunga. One of their placards read 'MCP party of murderers' another, 'Tembo stop killing us.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mkandawire acquitted Banda, Tembo and three others in a case in which they were charged with conspiracy to murder and attempted murder. The UDF supporters fear that Mkandawire would free John Tembo and company ust as he had done in the previous case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBC STAFFERS: There is a ray of hope that dismissed Malawi Broadcasting Corporation reporter, Hastings Maloya, could be reinstated, while his colleague, Francis Chikunkhuzeni, might have his suspension lifted following revelations confirming that an opposition rally, whose story the reporter filed took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maloya was dismissed allegedly for filing a story on an MCP rally held in the volatile Ndirande township, where a by-election is due on November 19.  Officials at MBC said the meeting was never held and said Maloya was dismissed solely for that reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unofficial reports say a team was set up to investigate the issue and establish whether the said meeting really took place or not and has since confirmed the opposition rally actually took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOVERNMENT TO PROBE LUNGUZI'S DEATH: President Bakili Muluzi announced at a rally in Lilongwe on September 2 his government would probe the death of former inspector general of police McWilliam Lunguzi who died in a car accident in June this year. He said it was difficult to believe how out of four passengers only one person sitting at the back of the car could die.  Lunguzi died when the vehicle he was travelling in together with MCP Vice President Gwanda Chakuamba hit a stationary tractor trailer in Dowa, central Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police inspector general Patrick Chikapa contradicted Muluzi at a press conference on Monday when he said as far as the police investigations were concerned, Lunguzi died in car accident, and the issue was closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the Lunguzi family on September 5 said they were gravely concerned with Muluzi's announcement that the government would institute a probe into the death of their father.In a press release, Lunguzi's eledest daughter, Lucy Mauluka said it was sad that the UDF were now posing as if they sympathised with the the family when neither the party nor the government sent a message of condolence to the deceased's family. She said in addition, she had evidence that some central executive members of the UDF were even celebrating over their father's death. &quot;Which was why he was not buried with full police honours as should have been the case,&quot; said Mauluka.  She said it was therefore hypocritical for the UDF government to pose as if they cared about his death.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - The honeymoon that Malawi's media has been enjoying with freedom of the press since the advent of political pluralism seems to be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's media landscape during the past two months has begun to change. The clear writing on the wall is that those ruling Malawi now will stop at nothing when it comes to suing a publication at the slightest hint of what they consider libel or defamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, this ship is being steered by no other than the man who has all along been touted by the local press as taking a leading role in defending and upholding freedom of the press in Malawi - President Bakili Muluzi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unprecedented move which looks like the beginning of a breakdown in press freedom, Muluzi has slapped a weekly newspaper, the Tribute, with a libel suit for publishing an article alleging that he grabbed land worth K500, 000 ($44,440) from a late friend. He has put in motion separate lawsuits - for the editor of the paper, its publisher and the printer of the newspaper .  His lawyers, Legalwise, have not, however, indicated how much they are demanding from each of those served with lawsuits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muluzi has also won a court injunction restraining the printers of the tabloid, Uniprint, from printing any newspaper until the issue is finalised in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Lady, Anne, has also obtained a court injunction barring another weekly tabloid, the Statesman, from carrying a column carrying her name (Anne) which used to ridicule her and the president. Perhaps the mother of all lawsuits is one from a wealthy Blantyre businessman and politician in the ruling party United Democratic Party, James Makhumula. The former minister has sued another weekly newspaper, the Chronicle, for K20 million (US 1.44 million dollars) , for publishing an article alleging that he grabbed land from a poor man in Zomba, 70 kilometres east of Blantyre. The case is being handled by lawyer and fellow deputy, Arthur Makhalira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some analysts say Muluzi's sudden about face is a gimmick, primarily targeted at punishing another fellow UDF central executive politician and member of parliament, Rolf Patel, who owns Uniprint, others say Malawian journalists should expect the terrain to become tougher, sooner than later.  Patel is one of ten or more UDF deputies dubbed 'rebels' for not toeing the party line and for openly criticising Muluzi's policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year in September, Muluzi refused to turn into law a bill on publications that required all publications, including newspapers, to publish the name of the printer, publisher, editor and reporter. The fine for failing to fulfil this requirement was K20,000 ($1,440). In refusing to assent to the bill, Muluzi said that if turned into law it would be a big dampener to the newly-found and much avowed freedom of press the country was enjoying after 30 years of single-party dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, just about a year later, Muluzi says journalists must be responsible in their reporting. He said that they should not create lies or distort facts at the expense of other peoples' reputations. If they step on other people's toes they must face the law just like everybody else. &quot;They are not above the law,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, the publications bill resurfaced in parliament during its recent sitting and it was passed. It is now back on Muluzi's desk to either make it into law or overturn it for the second time. And it is unsure just what Muluzi will do now. &quot; We have been asking ourselves what exactly is the use of the this bill? To whose benefit?&quot; asks Frank Kamwendo, Chairman of the Lilongwe Press Club. Kamwendo wonders how the bill could advance press freedom when it requires those newspapers which do not abide by it to pay a large fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if this was not enough to induce professional fear among journalists, the national radio, Malawi Broadcasting Corporation, only two weeks ago fired a reporter and suspended an editor allegedly for filing a story about an opposition party meeting which, it was said, did not take place. MBC, long criticised for its biased coverage of events and reportage in favour of the ruling UDF, is strongly controlled by government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, media groupings such as the Media Council of Malawi and the Journalists Association of Malawi have remained mute on the issue. Mollande Nkhata, chairman of the council, apparently trying to keep his head - he leads the news and current affairs section - says his council has not come up with a statement on the undemocratic decision by his employers because the council was still in its formative stage!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the opposition and the print media, it is only the Media Institute for Southern Africa (MISA), Malawi chapter, that has come up with a bold statement condemning the action and its aim of inducing fear among the electronic journalists and other media workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national radio has also received instructions, apparently from the Information and Broadcasting ministry, not to air anything in its news broadcasts about meetings addressed by a Blantyre member of parliament, Nicholas Kachingwe, who belongs to the same UDF 'rebel group'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court may not necessarily award Makhumula K1.4 million for defamation, but the strong message to Malawian journalists is that the days when they could lay their hands on any bits and pieces of information and send it further with impunity are gone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Despite its stated commitment to return Nigeria to civilian rule by October 1, 1998, the Nigerian government continues to violate the rights of Nigerian citizens to freely engage in political activity. Nigerian military rulers first announced a program to return the country to democratic government over ten years ago, and in &quot;Permanent Transition,&quot; released today, Human Rights Watch/Africa assesses the transition program and the steps that have been taken toward its implementation to date, including an examination of the seriously flawed local government elections of March 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 52-page report identifies the impediments to free political activity that destroy the transition program's credibility, including the detention and imprisonment of opposition politicians, human rights and pro-democracy activists, trade unionists and journalists, as well as restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, association and movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch charges that recent reforms announced by the government including the restoration of a right to appeal in some cases where it had been denied, the repeal of a decree preventing the courts from granting writs of habeas corpus in favor of detainees held without charge, and the creation of a human rights commission are purely cosmetic, and do not begin to address the need for fundamental reform and renewal. As a result, Human Rights Watch calls for the imposition of additional international sanctions including freezing the foreign assets of members of the Nigerian military government to ensure that Nigeria is returned to civilian rule by a freely elected government as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repression continues in Ogoniland, birthplace of executed minority rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa. Nineteen Ogonis still await trial before the same Civil Disturbances Special Tribunal that convicted Saro-Wiwa and eight others and sentenced them to death in October 1995 executions later described by British Prime Minister John Major as &quot;judicial murder.&quot; Other suspected sympathizers of Saro-Wiwa's organization, the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), were detained after demonstrations on January 4, 1996, celebrated as &quot;Ogoni Day&quot; since January 1993. Still more Ogonis were detained before or during the April visit of a fact-finding team sent by the U.N. Secretary General to Nigeria, despite assurances by the Nigerian government that nobody would be penalized for attempting to speak to the team.  While the Nigerian government has put in place token efforts at &quot; reconciliation&quot; in Ogoniland, it has not made any move to pay compensation to the families of the executed activists, as recommended by the U.N. fact- finding team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International attention has shifted from Nigeria during 1996, after an outcry following the November 1995 executions of the Ogoni Nine. Although sanctions imposed following the executions remain in force, as well as those put in place in 1993, no further measures have been imposed, despite the lack of genuine progress in returning the country to an elected government. The Commonwealth, which suspended Nigeria from membership in November 1995, has halted the implementation of additional sanctions recommended in April 1996 by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), pending further discussions with the Nigerian government. The Organization of African Unity has failed to take any measures against Nigeria, and the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, which held an extraordinary session on Nigeria in December 1995, has yet to follow this up with further action or recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch calls for international pressure to be maintained and intensified to ensure that the Nigerian government takes meaningful steps to improve the human rights situation. Detainees must be released and free expression and assembly restored in order to ensure a genuine transition to civilian rule. In particular, Human Rights Watch urges the imposition of a total arms embargo on Nigeria, and the freezing of assets held in other countries by members of the Nigerian armed forces or senior members of the government, and their families. Human Rights Watch calls specially on CMAG, which is meeting over the weekend of September 28 and 29, to urge the Commonwealth member states to implement the sanctions recommended by CMAG in April, and also to adopt an asset freeze and arms embargo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Since seizing power in Burundi two months ago, Major Pierre Buyoya -- mistakenly described as a moderate by U.S. and other western policymakers and media professionals -- has presided over the killing of more than 6,000 civilians. This represents a five-fold increase in the rate of slaughter in that divided country since the July 25th coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Burundi edges closer to the precipice of the genocidal abyss that claimed nearly one million people in neighboring Rwanda in 1994, the U.S. and its western allies have hesitated over how to respond. Meanwhile Burundi's African neighbors and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) have swiftly imposed full economic sanctions on the junta in Bujumbura.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction of the U.S. and its allies to the new emergency in Burundi will make clear how important the prevention of genocide is to these countries. Given the failure to prevent or stop the genocide in Rwanda, their response in Burundi will also confirm or dispel the belief that western governments operate with a double standard when African civilians are the ones dying by the tens of thousands in conflict situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its core, Burundi's problem is apartheid. Any lasting solution to the conflict must offer a plan to end Tutsi hegemony, or minority rule, while offering guarantees for every citizen's human rights. This is clear to those on the ground and ultimately the future security of the Tutsi minority depends upon the creation of a truly democratic state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finding such a durable solution will require the full support of the international community, especially the western powers. Policymakers who assume that Burundi should be left to itself and its neighbors to sort out are captives of a false, dangerous and racist belief that African conflicts are somehow different from those in other parts of the world and therefore do not warrant the same degree of international cooperation to resolve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The imposition of sanctions against Burundi signals an important turning point. The six states that adopted these measures -- Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Zaire and Ethiopia -- want to force Burundi's new military leaders to restore the national assembly and lift the ban on political parties. The larger aim is to create conditions for talks among all the key participants in the conflict and to establish a cease-fire between government and rebel forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctions are beginning to take effect. The economy is in a rapid decline and soon the military junta will be unable to pay its civil servants and its rapidly expanding army. If the military dictatorship doesn't move quickly to restore constitutional rule and establish a cease-fire and a mechanism for all-party talks, additional sanctions will be required. Already an arms embargo should be adopted and applied against both sides of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If these pressures succeed in producing negotiations, the talks must then focus on ending minority rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The habit among many State Department officials and their European counterparts, of defining the problem in Burundi in terms of &quot;moderates&quot; vs. &quot; extremists&quot; on both sides of the Hutu majority - Tutsi minority divide, is misleading and counterproductive. The bottom line struggle in Burundi is to end the exclusion of 85% of the population from decisionmaking and access to resources, and create a system of democratic majority rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tutsi minority has legitimate fears of retaliation and genocide at the hands of the long repressed Hutu majority in much the same manner that South Africa's white minority feared black majority rule. But until this minority, which includes both the military and the business elite, is forced to accept a democratic system of governance its continued repressive and deadly rule will sow even more seeds of the tragic future it fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If agreement is reached to negotiate a way out of this national nightmare in Burundi, a peacekeeping force will be required to keep the warring parties apart and eventually to oversee a disarmament, demobilization and retraining process aimed at establishing a thoroughly reformed national force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if economic sanctions do not produce the desired talks and cease-fire, then a different type of international intervention force under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter will be required to intervene and create the conditions necessary for peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other military options such as an international observer brigade or an all- African intervention force are both poor alternatives. The first would be little more than a toothless observer while the second idea should only be considered as a last resort. A truly international peacekeeping or peacemaking force should not be an all-African volunteer force, but rather a blued-helmeted U.N. force like those to which African nations have contributed soldiers -- and lives -- for numerous conflict resolution efforts around the world in places such as Bosnia, Cambodia, and Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prevention of genocide in Burundi requires and deserves external intervention. Sadly, out of some 80 countries asked by the United Nations to lend support for a possible peacekeeping mission in Burundi, only three African states have offered to send troops. Without a change of policy on the part of the U.S. and its western allies, the double standard will be confirmed and an all African force will become the only option available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. policy to support economic sanctions and facilitate peace talks doesn't go far enough. While the U.S. must continue to refuse any formal recognition the military regime, it must also prepare to commit financial resources, logistical support and -- yes -- ground troops to an international peacekeeping or peacemaking intervention in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The so-called &quot;Somalia syndrome&quot; -- which suggests that Americans won't support sending soldiers on peace missions in Africa -- applies more to policymakers than to the public. The prevention of genocide anywhere is in the national and international interest. The public has the heart to understand this and the stomach to accept the risks involved. This is something that both the President and Mr. Dole should have the courage to acknowledge even in an election year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Nigeria's foreign minister, Tom Ikimi has welcomed the decision by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) to proceed with its fact- finding mission to Nigeria, saying it would help build on the dialogue started in London in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi said in an interview in New York that the decision, reached Sunday after two days of CMAG talks was in consonance with the Nigerian position on its disagreement with the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our position has always remained the same: we believe that the difficulties that we have with the Commonwealth can only be resolved through negotiations and discussions and dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We welcome their decision to come to Nigeria to attend a meeting between the Commonwealth and Nigeria and we look forward to the meeting,&quot; Ikimi said.  The Nigerian minister is in New York to attend the current 51st regular session of the United Nations General Assembly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he cautioned that in proceeding with the meeting, the eight-nation CMAG should understand the &quot;areas of concern to Nigeria&quot; at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also need to recognize the fact that since Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in a manner which was indeed very unprecedented. Nigeria has not been standing still. A lot of changes have taken place in Nigeria during the past year,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign minister also stressed the need for CMAG to take into consideration the role that the U.N. had played so that &quot;nothing should be done to set back the progress already made by the U.N. or the progress already made by Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a reference to the U.N. fact-finding mission to Nigeria early in the early, which gave qualified support to the military government's transition to democracy programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi reiterated Nigeria's commitment to the Commonwealth, saying that the country cherished its long membership in the organisation, and would not do anything to upset the opportunity it had always had to contribute to world peace and understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CMAG, which has the mandate of ensuring adherence to the Harare Declaration on democracy and human rights, among others, decided Sunday after its fifth meeting in New York, to drop the threat of sanctions against Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CMAG is made up of Britain, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, South Africa, Malaysia, New Zealand and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting sanctions on hold and opting for dialogue, the group decided that it will proceed with its fact-finding mission to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The group was fully conscious of the need to continue the dialogue began in June 1996,&quot; according to a communique issued by the CMAG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group said that the trip, expected to take place &quot;at the earliest possible date&quot; and for which no conditions were set, would enable it to complete its current assessment and make recommendations on future measures relating to the situation in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the talks, held at the Malaysian mission to the U.N., CMAG deliberated on the report of the Commonwealth Secretariat team that visited Nigeria early September, and was briefed by a U.N. assistant secretary- general, Lansana Kouyate, on the U.N.'s fact-finding mission to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CMAG Chairman, Stan Mudenge of Zimbabwe, said the New York meeting dwelt more on the need to continue dialogue than on sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we go to Nigeria, we are continuing with the dialogue (that) we started with the Nigeria authorities (in June in London),&quot; Mudenge, Zimbabwe's foreign minister, told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what guarantees CMAG had that it would have a free access to all those it would wish to see during the trip, he said: &quot;we are expecting to be given access to enable us to make the right assessment and recommendations.  We have made it clear to the Nigerian authorities what it will take us to be able to make an informed assessment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that he expected that the group would visit Nigeria before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that the sanctions, which include a ban on sporting links and arms sale and downgrading of cultural links and diplomatic missions, would not be implemented until CMAG had made its assessment and recommendations to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CMAG sources said the meeting was held under a &quot;largely cordial atmosphere,&quot; making it easy to reach a consensus in spite of the hard line taken in the past by some members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mudenge defended the organisation's decision to pursue further dialogue with Nigeria instead of sanctions, saying this did not amount to a loss of credibility on its part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said no other organisation was more credible than the Commonwealth in dealing with Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lloyd Axworthy, the foreign minister of Canada, whose country has unilaterally imposed sanctions on Nigeria, supported the assertion, saying: &quot; we are working consensus here and what is really important is to have opportunity to have the kind of access to Nigeria to find what's going on and to make an assessment.&quot; On the fact that CMAG was no longer giving any condition for the mission, the British minister for overseas development, Lynda Chalker, said: &quot;you wait for guarantees in this life (and) you never get anything achieved. You have to venture forth. We are venturing forth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between Nigeria and the Commonwealth, which groups Britain and its former colonies, have soured since 1995 when it was suspended from the group following the execution for murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BANJUL, Gambia - Soldiers drove Sunday through the streets of Banjul, capital of this tiny West African state, to celebrate the victory of the retired colonel Yahya Jammeh in Thursday's presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uniformed soldiers waved green tree branches, the symbol of the former military ruler's Alliance for Patriotic Re-orientation and Construction (APRC) , which scooped 55.76% of the votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoteliers in the Gambian capital expressed optimism of a good winter tourism season because of the new democratic era that has been established after the elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hotel manager expressed concern, however, over a report by a foreign radio station Saturday to the effect that the polls were rigged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The radio report was fictitious because all the four contesting parties had agents in all the polling stations, and where the ballots were counted,&quot; said the manager on condition that his name be kept secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He conceded, however, that the continued hiding of Ousainou Darboe, Jammeh's most serious challenger in last Thursday's polls, in the Senegalese embassy could cause apprehension among potential tourists that &quot;something was wrong here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daraboe, who went into hiding Thursday night, has not conceded defeat. His party, the United Democratic Party (UDP) received 35.84 percent of the 394, 537 votes cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the contestants, Hamat Bah of the National Reconstruction Party (NRP) , who received 5.52 percent of the votes, conceded defeat at a news conference Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His agent told PANA Sunday morning that his organisation had no quarrel with the election results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analyst told PANA that those who are surprised by Jammeh's victory ignore the fact that he singly occupied the political scene for two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only those who don't go to the rural areas are unaware of what this young man has been doing, especially in the construction of schools, &quot; said an expatriate, Clive Barlow, who has lived in the Gambia since 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who will not vote for someone who reduces the distance his child has to walk to school&quot;, said a veteran Radio Gambia broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I started this work in 1962. But it's only under Jammeh that our radio can cover the whole country because he allocated the funds. In addition, we now have television,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts said Jammeh could have scored even higher had he not banned three other political parties, including the People's Progressive Party (PPP) of former President Dawda Jawara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jammeh would have scored even higher votes because the other political parties would have inevitably engaged in bickering. It was not easy for him this time because the three banned parties simply threw their weight behind Darboe, &quot; said one political analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Jammeh should use his newly acquired legitimacy to tackle &quot;the extremely low standard of living of the majority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Jammeh has done well in providing basic infrastructures, schools, television, roads, extension of the airport and the &quot;July 22 arc&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the living conditions of many Gambians are so bad that priority needs to be directed there,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique - The man who murdered Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme in February 1986 may be living in the central Mozambican city of Beira, according to the Swedish newspaper 'Aftonbladet'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its weekend edition, 'Aftonbladet' said that the South African agent suspected of assassinating Palme, Antony White, is based in Beira, and working at a sawmill that serves as a cover for various criminal activities, including drug running.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper says that White was working for the notorious South African spy Craig Williamson. He was named last week as heading the secret police 'Operation Longreach' which targeted Palme for assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson is currently in Angola working in the diamond trade. He told 'Aftonbladet' that White had gone to Beira, but was unsure whether he was still there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson's role in planning the Palme murder was indicated last week by Col. Eugene de Kock, former head of the apartheid police's Vlakplaas death squad. Citing Swedish police sources, 'Aftonbladet' confirmed that Williamson had been in Sweden at the time of the assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock claimed that the apartheid regime had spent at least 70,000 rands (about 23,000 U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of the time) in arranging Palme's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock's predecessor at Vlakplaas, Dirk Coetzee, the man who blew the whistle on apartheid death squads, and defected to the African National Congress, named White as the assassin on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believed, however, that White had taken refuge on a Greek island or in Cyprus, rather than in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White was once a member of the Selous Scouts, one of the most feared and hated units in the Rhodesian army that waged war against the people of Zimbabwe and the neighboring states in the 1970s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana - Ghana's Kofi Quaye retained his West African light- heavyweight crown when he technically knocked out Bamidele Disu of Nigeria in the third of their scheduled 12-round title bout at the Kaneshie sports complex on Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian, who went down once in each round, failed to withstand Quaye's heavy punches and his corner threw in the towel to save him after the third round knockdown in one minute 15 seconds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disu, who had earlier described Quaye as a sluggish boxer and had predicted a resounding victory, was forced to eat back his words right from the opening bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian was the first to attack but Quaye parried away his punches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quaye, relying on tips from Azumah Nelson, WBC super- featherweight champion, landed a powerful right on the chin of the Nigerian which sent him on to the ropes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disu, thereafter, started to retreat but Quaye chased him round the ring and got another right punch through, which sent the Nigerian to the canvas for the mandatory count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian could not offer any resistance as he kissed the canvas for the second time in round two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quaye dominated the exchanges and after Disu's third knockdown, his cornermen threw in the towel to save their ward from further punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stoner Jones also retained his national and West Africa super-bantamweight crown on points over T.T. Quaynor in their 12-rounds title bout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the three judges scored for the champion. E.J.D. Osabutey scored the fight 118-114, J.B. Owusu-Ansah 117-115 and Abbey Adama 117-114.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal - Sports officials here say preparations are in top gear for the Nov. 12 World Boxing Council (WBC) title fight between home boy, Jean- Baptiste Mendy and Steve Johnston of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendy, 33, decided to defend the WBC light-weight title he won in April 1996, in Dakar as a tribute to his home fans and supporters, the president of the Senegalese Boxing Federation, Mamadou Ndoye, told PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The France-based boxer will trade punches over 13 rounds with Johnston, an African-America based in California, at the Demba Diop stadium in the Senegalese capital, Ndoye said in an interview.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 45,000 spectators are expected to watch the fight, the third major world boxing bout to take place in Africa, added Jacques Diouf, vice- president of the local boxing and one of the promoters of the fight.  Contracts for the bout which was previously scheduled to take place on Nov. 7, was signed at the beginning of September. Diouf said an investment of some 225 million f CFA (about 450,000 U.S. dollars) would go into event. Both boxers will share 400,000 dollars of prize money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendy, a naturalized French citizen, defended the European light-weight category title nine times. He has 47 fights, winning 30 by knock-out and losing only five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnston, 23, has won all 38 fights of his career, 20 of them through knock- out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers regard the fight as a mega event, comparable only to the Ali- Foreman heavyweight fight Tagged &quot;the Rumble In the Jungle' in Kinshasa, Zaire in 1974. Another world boxing tournament took place later between Cote d'Ivoire's Elisa Obeth and American Sea Robinson in Abidjan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among dignitaries expected at the Dakar fight to be hosted under the high patronage of President Abdou Diouf, is WBC President, Jose Suleiman of Mexico and the President of the African Boxing Federation, Taib Houichi of Tunisia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendy is offering 1,000 seats free of charge to folk from his native Casamance region of southern Senegal, to enable them watch the match, Diouf said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said apart from the economic &quot;boom&quot; and the exposure the event would give the country of seven million people, It would also provide an opportunity to relaunch Senegalese boxing mooted in 1993, when the ashes of its best known boxer, Louis Mbareck Fall, alias &quot;battling Siki&quot; was returned from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fall was shot dead in New York December 1925, after he won a middle-weight title fight against an American challenger.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigerians mark the 36th anniversary of their country's independence Tuesday, still grappling with the problem of how to evolve an enduring democracy after more than 25 years of military rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's most populous nation of some 100 million people has had a checkered political history since gaining independence from Britain on Oct. 1, 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to political analysts in Lagos, one of the greatest problems has been the incessant military interventions in politics, characterized by coups and counter-coups. Civilians have governed the country for only 11 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neither the military regimes nor the civilian administrations have been spared by critics on allegations of corruption, mismanagement and ethnicity, considered the bane of governance in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at an church service Sunday, as part of the anniversary events, an official of the Christian Association of Nigeria, said &quot;many Nigerians wonder whether our independence has been a blessing or a curse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Methodist Bishop Sunday Makinde noted that in the 36 years of independence &quot; some of our fine, knowledgeable, astute and brilliant politicians have been killed, detained and humiliated out of office for political and economic recklessness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makinde's recipe is that Nigerian politicians should &quot;dialogue with the military in the process to disengage them from politics if they don't want (Gen. Sani) Abacha's transition programme to be Babangidaised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clergy was referring to the eight-year transition to democracy programme of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, which ended in political chaos, forcing him to step aside on Aug. 26, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After postponing his hand-over several times, Babangida annulled Nigeria's June 12, 1993 presidential election, in a move that threw the country into one of its worst political crisis after the 30-month civil war that ended in January 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha, a key member of the Babangida regime, inherited the political turmoil that trailed the annulment, when he took over power on 17 Nov. 1993, from a lame-duck interim civilian administration installed by Babangida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through tough decisions, the bespectacled infantry general has managed to calm the restive political temperature in the multi-ethnic and culturally plural west African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the contentious issues of human right and democracy, Abacha virtually took on the international community and the uncoordinated pockets of pro- democracy and opposition groups at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with time, his no-nonsense approach has started to win him grudging support from even his most vociferous critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The April dethronement of Ibrahim Dasuki, the powerful 18th Sultan of Sokoto and the supreme head of Moslems in Nigeria, is often cited as one of such tough actions by the Abacha regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dasuki, who was replaced by Muhammadu Maccido, was accused of financial impropriety and being disrespectful to the military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the economic scene, Abacha has impressed many, especially with his failed banks and economic frauds decree, which has resulted in the imprisonment of a dozen bank chief executives convicted of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are indications similar measures could be extended to poorly-managed government parastatals as part of the sanitation of governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to economists, the regime has also achieved some success in budget discipline, resulting in relative stability of the exchange rate and reduction in the rate of inflation as part investor confidence-building measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government recently launched another economic blueprint &quot;vision 2010,&quot; designed to ensure &quot;prosperity, political stability and socially harmonious society&quot; within 14 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the political arena, after initial opposition from pro-democracy groups at home and abroad, the international community seems to be reading good meaning in the administration's three-year transition to democracy programme, planned to end on Oct. 1, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the British-led Commonwealth, which suspended Nigeria from its fold over the 1995 execution for murder of nine minority rights activists, including author Ken Saro-Wiwa, is still raising an issue over human rights situation in the country, the United Nations has given a qualified support to the transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report after its fact-finding mission visited Nigeria March 29 to April 12, the world body opposed imposition of sanctions on the country, and said that nothing should be done to upset the momentum of the transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. also called for political and judicial reforms, especially to improve Nigeria's human rights situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech to mark the independence anniversary, Nigerians expect Abacha to address the issue of detainees such as Lagos lawyer Gani Fawehinmi, oil union official Frank Korori and civil liberties organisation representative Chima Ubani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the issue of politician Moshood Abiola, who claimed victory in the June 1993 presidential election annulled by Babangida. Abiola is facing trial for treason after he declared himself president of Nigeria in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the transition programme, expectations are high that the anniversary speech could announce creation of at least six new states in Nigeria in addition to the existing 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political parties that will vie for power in the upcoming republic are also expected to be known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed sources indicate that at least four of the 14 political associations that applied for registration could make the pack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still on the bright side, one area in which Nigerians can beat their chest for glorious achievements since independence is sports, especially soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha's anniversary speech is expected to contain one or two lines of commendation for Nigeria's gold-winning under-23 soccer squad at the recent Centennial Olympics in Atlanta, United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By and large, analysts say, Abacha owes Nigerians a duty to engineer a successful transition that would guarantee peace and stability in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasama - Former President Kenneth Kaunda was on Sunday denied access to the tomb of the late Catholic Archbishop Elias Mutale at St. John's cathederal in Kasama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kaunda, who is in the Northern Province to drum up support for himself and his one time ruling party, had wanted to use his time there to win sympathies from significant catholic believers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of his campaign then the former President asked one time UNIP leader and long standing catholic Rankin Sikasula to accompany him to the cathedral for the main mass.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst there he decided to effect a 'coup de theatre' by requesting that he be allowed to visit the tomb of the late Archbishop Mutale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But rector in charge of the cathedral, Father Chomba, deferred an answer suggesting that the request be put to the congregation instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Father Chomba delivered it to the congregation it was unanimously rejected as being out of order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rejection was easy to understand because at the time that Archbishop Mutale died in a mysterious road accident in 1991 a finger had been pointed at the Kaunda regime which was believed at the time to have master minded the death of this catholic cleric who had been determinedly opposed to the one party rule of Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit to the late Bishop's tomb, therefore, would have helped to raise his standing particularly in the eyes of young voters who at the time of the incident might not have understood what it was all about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile barely four days after declaring their intention to boycott the coming presidential and parliamentary elections UNIP president, Dr Kaunda has announced a u-turn from the position adopted at the 31st National Council meeting held in the midlands town of Kabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to Zambia Information Service in Kasama on Saturday Dr kaunda said the party would not boycott the polls after all but that the party will continue to fight the 1996 constitution which bars him and his vice, Chief Inyambo Yeta, from contesting the coming polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hinted, however, that the boycott may only be resorted to if government turned out to be unyielding on the question of the constitution, Nikuv compiled voters rolls and other issues which have remained unresolved betwee opposition parties and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile a UNIP official maintained today that the party has many leaders who can take over the mantle from Dr Kaunda should he be barred from lodging his candidature for presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP secretary for Information and Publicity Bweendo Mulengela said in an interview: &quot;UNIP has a surplus of leaders but we would prefer to dialogue and remove contentious clauses in the constitution which is discriminatory,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that the just ended national council in Kabwe, resolved to boycott the elections not because UNIP had no quality leaders but because they feel their elected leader was being victimised deliberately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He boasted that his party has produced many leaders who were in both the ruling MMD and the opposition and was capable of finding a leader when Dr Kaunda's term ends but would remain united and royal to party guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot desert Dr Kaunda now because in UNIP we are united unlike other parties which run-away from their leaders when faced with problems,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulengela would not say, however, why it had taken Dr Kaunda close to five years before he could renounce his Malawian citizenship.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Saudi Arabian clubs are said to be clamouring to sign on some national soccer team players as professional in the oil-rich Saudi Arabian league after their impressive three-match tour of the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top on the wanted list is Zamsure star midfielder, Andrew Tembo and the Power Dynamos duo of Jones Mwewa and Mwape Miti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to some national team players, the Saudi Arabian clubs expressed interest in signing them on soon after the African Nations Cup qualifier against Mozambique slated for next Sunday at the Independence Stadium in Lusaka.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of us were approached and according to what they told us, it seems something can come up in as far as going to play there is concerned,&quot; said one of the players in an interview at the Inter-Continental Hotel in Lusaka on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First secretary at the Saudi embassy in Lusaka, Abduk Al Reyes, hinted last Friday that a lot of Saudi clubs want players from Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of clubs in Saudi Arabia want players from Zambia but on this trip, I don't know who will be wanted first, but I will inform you if I get anything from Saudi Arabia,&quot; said Reyes in a telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But camp manager, Solly Pandor, said in a seperate interview that while the players may have been approached, it is the individual players who can make decisions on the offers .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it is not good at this stage to talk of that, but if we can wait until after the match against Mozambique as talking on that may affect some players during the match. But whichever players were approached will make their personal decisions, no one will decide for them,&quot; said Pandor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the players, who arrived on Saturday on the same plane with towering defender, Elijah Litana, who plays his club football in the Saudi Arabian league, were confident that victory could come out of the Africa Cup match against Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be a tough match but we will surely not allow them to beat us here, &quot; said the players as they sat relaxing at the hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And trainer, Roald Poulsen, whose side drew 0-0 with Oman and, lost 2-1 to the Saudi Arabian national team before beating them 3-1, was equally confident of a good result against Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have had very good training and I think the match will be fine, but what you have to know is that Mozambique also have a very good team,&quot; said Poulsen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia is headed for a presidential, constitutional and electoral crisis due to ambiguities introduced by the Constitution (Amendment) Act of 1996, a civic leader has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president, Alfred Zulu, warned yesterday, that the new constitution does not provide for a structure to govern after the mandate for the ruling MMD comes to an end on October 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Zulu, the crisis will be further compounded should the opposition UNIP decide to petition President Chiluba's candidature over his &quot; foggy origins&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a possibility that Chiluba's nomination may be petitioned or the Chief Justice may refuse to accept both Chiluba and Kaunda's nomination papers,&quot; Zulu said, warning: &quot;But should that happen, the country will be plunged into a constitutional and electoral crisis as the Constitution does not provide for the Chief Justice to take over the reins of power.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zulu also pointed out that President Chiluba's continued stay at State House after October 31 shall be illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Midnight of November 2, 1996 is the maximum period,&quot; Zulu said. &quot;Beyond that, he will be extending his rule illegally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also expressed misgivings over the President's failure to announce the elections date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Article 35 of the Constitution, he should have dissolved Parliament by August 1, 1996 and announced the election date so that he is within the 90-day grace period,&quot; Zulu said. &quot;If he dissolves Parliament after October 31st, it means elections will be held in February.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But chief government spokesman information minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa said Zulu's fears were unjustified as the provision to take over the presidency has never been in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Go through the Constitution as far back as 1964 through 1991 up to the 1996 amendment and find out if the provision is located or enshrined anywhere, &quot;Mwanamwambwa said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanamwambwa's answer suggests government has another way out of this predicament but he could not disclose it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Find out how the state has been surviving under those conditions. Was there any vacuum left?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former ambassador to Japan, Boniface Zulu, however said he could not recall elections ever being delayed since the January 20, 1964 independence elections and the only multiparty elections of December, 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He deplored the government's attitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is a negative approach from the government if elections will be delayed and they say there is no problem. They will be creating a bad precedent for future generations,&quot; Zulu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And acting director of elections, Joel Sikazwe, disclosed to an Elections Reporting class for Zambian journalists organised by the Southern University - USAID and the Zambia Institute of Mass Communication (ZAMCOM) on September 19, 1996 that the Chief Justice, who is returning officer for the presidential elections, will not refuse Chiluba or Kaunda's nomination papers but that their nominations may be reversed by petitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A returning officer for parliamentary candidates or for presidential candidates is not supposed to act as a criminal investigations officer...the law is very straight forward,&quot; Sikazwe said. &quot;Someone will be able to walk to any nomination centre and lodge in their nomination papers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Sikazwe, the returning officer is just supposed to receive nomination papers and process them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let the injured person or injured party protest. Let them lodge in an election petition,&quot; Sikazwe said. &quot;That is why people are saying 'what will happen if Super Ken (Kaunda) takes his nomination papers to the Supreme Court and lodges them?'. Will the Chief Justice, in his capacity as returning officer, just look at them and say, 'former president! You are lodging in these papers?' The answer is No...He will merely play his part as returning officer and leave the rest to the injured party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP publicity secretary, Bweendo Mulengela, in an interview yesterday, disclosed that his party would definitely petition President Chiluba's candidature in the forthcoming elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have made it very clear that we are going to petition Chiluba's nomination,&quot; Mulengela said. &quot;We challenge him to show us the graves of his parents. We want him to tell us who he is. Is he Titus Mpundu, Kafupi Chabala or Frederick Chiluba? We will not allow him to stand until he answers these questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulengela appealed to the government to quickly address the contentious issues in the Constitution to avoid a crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People of Zambia shouldn't be made to pass through this patch because President Chiluba's case is more complicated than Dr Kaunda's,&quot; Mulengela said. &quot;We implore President Chiluba, for the purpose of the dignity of the presidents office, to find a better way out of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Alteration of the Constitution of Zambia depends on who commands the majority in Parliament and in the population of eligible voters for the referendum, ruled Lusaka High Court justice Bobby Bwalya on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismissing an application for an order of ceiteriori to quash the 1996 Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Act number 18 by the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC), Justice Bwalya said the entrenched provisions of the Constitution can be altered but the theory of preservation of basic structures or framework does not exist in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC, through Simeza Sangwa and Associates, had submitted that the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Act number 18 of 1996 was ultra vires article 79 of the Constitution in that the said Act altered or destroyed the basic structure or framework of the constitution of 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the Amendment Act No. 18 had not amended the 1991 Constitution but created whole new provisions making it a new constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bwalya explained that Parliament in the Zambian Constitution means the National Assembly and the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its powers, jurisdiction and competence to alter the Constitution of Zambia are extensive, provided Parliament adheres to the provisions of Article 79. This article limits the powers of Parliament with regard to Article 79 itself and Chapter III of the Constitution of Zambia,&quot; Judge Bwalya ruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if Parliament can amass the required majority and the party in government can get the necessary stipulated majority in a referendum under Article 79 (3), then Parliament's limitations become a theoretical postulate (assumed to be true) rather than reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gave examples of the 1969 referendum, the alteration of the 1964, 1973, 1991 and now 1996 Zambian Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the answer lies in Politics and not law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until such a time that the electorate decides to vote in a party into government that will effect alterations to the constitution that the applicant (ZDC) has in mind, the whole idea can not be achieved under the present constitution or indeed the 1991 constitution,&quot; Judge Bwalya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said on the whole he was satisfied that the Constitution of Zambia Amendment Act No. 18 of 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is not ultra vires Article 79 of the Constitution in any way, sense, expressly or implied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, granted ZDC the right to appeal and each party to bear its own costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in an interview on Saturday, ZDC vice-president Kasuka Mutukwa said his party is appealing to the Supreme Court against judge Bwalya's judgement and even in the event of the Supreme Court dismissing the appeal, other means will be found of seeking justice over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have already instructed our lawyers to go ahead and appeal to the Supreme Court because these are fundamental issues which should be seen to be legitimate,&quot; Mutukwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Judge Bwalya's judgement implies that any party which comes into government can change the constitution to its convenience just for the sake of changing it, which should never be the case in a democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This constitution was done in bad faith, and we will try to amend it within 90 days of assuming office,&quot; Mutukwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC general secretary, Derrick Chitala, yesterday charged that justice Bwalya had misdirected himself in both law and fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the the judgement was an indicator that the judiciary in this country had been infiltrated and that it would be hard for people to get real justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even as we plan to appeal, we are not sure that real justice will be given to us because of manipulation of the courts by the MMD,&quot; Chitala carped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNIP chairperson for Legal and Constitutional Affairs Mwangala Zaloumis, on Friday at the Evelyn Hone College Press Club said if the country's constitution is not right, nothing will ever be right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not opposed to the Constitution because it bars Kaunda. No. We are opposing it out of principle because it was done in bad faith, and we fear for the future of this country.&quot; Zaloumis said. &quot;The new constitution is sowing seeds of destruction in the country and we can see what will happen in this country from the experience of Liberia and Rwanda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda's special assistant for press, recently released &quot;treason&quot; detainee Muhabi Lungu, addressing the same meeting said one of the qualifications to contest the presidential elections is to be an eligible voter not a registered voter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of he qualifications to be President of Zambia says, to run for presidential office, you have to be an eligible voter, not a registered voter, and the fact that Dr. Kaunda did not register as a voter with Nikuv Computers, which we were and are still opposed to, does not in any way disqualify him to contest the polls,&quot; Lungu said in answering a question why Kaunda did not register as a voter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the major reason why former president Kaunda did not register as voter is because he was a complainant in a court case opposing Nikuv registering voters and it was out of principle that the UNIP Central Committee advised him not to register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What would have been the purpose of registering with the company you took to court because you are not agreeable to its work,&quot; Lungu said. &quot;In fact I wish we had all boycotted the exercise.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Tourism minister Gabriel Maka has advised foreign investors in the tourism industry to leave the country if they were not happy with investment conditions being offered by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows the departure from the country of Lake International Company, a British company that had successful bid for the Rainbow Lodge in Livingstone citing the government's delay in signing lease agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview last week, Maka defended the government of delays in the issuing of signing lease agreements to foreign tourism investors some of who have started to leave the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He charged that it was not the government's fault that foreign investors who had bid for the state owned tourist lodges had started leaving the country in search of other business ventures elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We explained to them that as a ministry we had to decide on the lease period and that is what caused the delays but when we later called them to come and sign the lease agreements some of the foreign investors did not respond,&quot; Maka said. &quot;Its not our fault. What they should say is that they have set their priorities elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the withdrawal of the British investor, Rainbow Lodge together with Chichele Lodge in Eastern Province will be re-advertised in the press for new bidders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And commenting on what he termed as an unfortunate development, Zambia National Tourism Board newly appointed chairman, Anderson Mazoka said there was need for the investors to call on his organisation if they encountered huddles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is rather unfortunate that we only have to learn about this development from the press. We want to appeal to all the investors in the sector to approach us once they experience such problems and we will always try to help out,&quot; Mazoka said in an interview on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the European Union on Thursday handed over 14 Land Rover motor vehicles to the Tourism ministry under an K8 billion grant programme signed three months ago, aimed at re-organising wildlife and tourism management in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the hand-over ceremony at the National Parks and Wildlife Services headquarters in Chilanga, EU delegation leader, Charles Brook, said the grant would help contribute to a positive change in the management of the country's wildlife resources which was currently threatened with continued depletion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The project offers the real possibility of a major and positive change in the manner in which Zambia's Wildlife resources can both be preserved and make a significant contribution of job creation in the tourism sector,&quot; Brook said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Liberia-Complex Emergency, Situation Report # 2 (FY96), 9/30/96. U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID), BUREAU FOR HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE (BHR), OFFICE OF U.S. FOREIGN DISASTER ASSISTANCE (OFDA) . Note: The last situation report was dated June 5, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has been in the throes of civil war since December 24, 1989. Peace- keeping forces from the Economic Community of West African States' (ECOWAS) Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) arrived in August 1990 to separate the warring factions and to provide security for the Monrovia area. During the war at least eight major rebel groups have contended for power in Liberia: 1) Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front for Liberia (NPFL), 2) Alhaji Kromah's ethnic Mandingo-based United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO/Mandingo), 3) a Krahn-based ULIMO splinter group led by Roosevelt Johnson (ULIMO/Krahn), 4) an NPFL splinter group named the Central Revolutionary Council (CRC-NPFL) led by former Charles Taylor supporter Tom Woewiyu, 5) another Krahn-based group called the Liberia Peace Council (LPC), led by George Boley, 6) the Lofa Defense Force (LDF) headed by Francois Massaquoi, 7) the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) -- the Krahn-dominated army of the late President Samuel Doe, and 8) the Congo Defense force, reportedly an off- shoot of the NPFL.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After six years of war, the leaders of the main warring factions signed a thirteenth peace agreement on August 19, 1995, in Abuja, Nigeria, known as the Abuja Peace Accord. On April 6, 1996, the cease-fire negotiated at Abuja was broken when fighting erupted in Monrovia between the NPFL and the ULIMO/Krahn. During April and May, the warring factions looted and destroyed major sections of the capital city and nearly all expatriate non- governmental organization (NGO) and United Nations (U.N.) staff were evacuated. On August 17, an amended implementation schedule for the Abuja Peace Accord, which calls for a cease-fire and sets out a new schedule for disarmament, demobilization, and elections, was signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of a pre-war population of over 2.4 million, approximately 1.5 million Liberians continue to require humanitarian assistance. This number includes over 700,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), most of whom are concentrated in Monrovia and Buchanan. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that 400,000 Liberian refugees remain in Guinea, 300,000 in Cote d'Ivoire, 20,000 in Sierra Leone, 16,000 in Ghana, and 4,000 in Nigeria. Liberia also hosts approximately 120,000 Sierra Leonean refugees.  It is estimated that more than 150,000 people have died as a result of the war. The Liberian Ministry of Health (MOH) estimates that up to 3,000 people may have died in recent fighting in April and May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. GOVERNMENT (USG) HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FY 1996 (to date) = $76,713, 497</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Monrovia remains calm, skirmishes continued in June, July, and August between the ULIMO/Mandingo and ULIMO/Krahn factions in Bomi and Cape Mount counties and between the LPC and the NPFL in Grand Gedeh and Sinoe counties in the southeast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Sani Abacha of Nigeria was elected ECOWAS chairman at an ECOWAS Summit held on July 26-27. At an ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia Summit meeting, held in Abuja from August 13-17, ECOWAS heads of state and Liberian faction leaders negotiated the amended schedule to the Abuja Accord which provided for a cease-fire to be implemented by August 31, disarmament and demobilization to be completed by January 31, 1997, and elections to be held on May 30, 1997. Summit leaders also raised the possibility of sanctions, such as exclusion from elections, and establishment of a war crimes tribunal for those warlords who do not comply with the Abuja Accord. In addition, Ruth Perry, a former senator, was appointed to replace the current Council of State chair, Wilton Sankawulo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During April and May, the warring factions looted about 75% of Monrovia, including private homes, shops, churches, schools, government buildings, and the offices of U.N. agencies and NGOs. NGOs and U.N. agencies lost an estimated 489 vehicles, valued at approximately $8.2 million. The Spriggs Payne Airfield's airport terminal and control tower were burned but the runway is intact and regular air service has resumed. Telecommunications service, electricity, and water were all affected by the crisis. All schools in Monrovia were suspended and have not yet re-opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political/Military Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April the U.S. Government pledged an additional $30 million in conditional assistance to ECOMOG. The money will be used for communications systems, training, command and control support, logistical support, and essential needs of the troops such as footwear, clothing, blankets, and tents.  ECOMOG troop presence now extends from Monrovia as far as the Po River in the west and to Kakata in the North. They also control the port city of Buchanan. ECOMOG plans to deploy in Tubmanburg, Cape Mount, Gbarnga, Suehen, and Lofa county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the ECOWAS Committee of Nine Summit, several governments expressed willingness to send further troops to Liberia. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire strengthened its border controls to impede possible arms flows and prevent refugee-related violence. The U.N. Security Council extended the U.N.  Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) mandate until November 30, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief efforts in Liberia are handicapped by the recent looting and destruction of humanitarian assets in Monrovia, harassment of relief workers traveling outside the &quot;safe-haven&quot; of Monrovia, and lack of cooperation by government officials and factional fighters. Fighting in Bomi and Grand Cape Mount counties has made humanitarian access difficult in these areas since the crisis began in April. The southeastern counties also remain largely inaccessible, although some NGOs have gone as far as the Cestos River, one- third of the way into the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U. N. World Food Program (WFP) reported on July 19 that humanitarian agencies negotiated with warring factions to remove 160 severely malnourished persons from Suehn, Bomi county to Monrovia. Reportedly, they were held against their will by the factions trying to draw relief food to the area. On July 25, faction fighters denied permission to evacuate severely malnourished children and their families to Monrovia. On July 28, a high level U.N./NGO mission returned and convinced the local chief of staff to allow 353 people to be voluntarily evacuated from Suehn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, a group of 12 international NGOs meeting in Geneva announced a joint-position limiting humanitarian assistance in Liberia to &quot;targeted, minimal, life-saving interventions&quot;. Following a second meeting in Geneva on August 5-6, an expanded group of 20 NGOs voted to amend the policy guidelines to include &quot;minimal inputs for maximum impact&quot;. The change in guidelines allowed for more flexibility at the field level in determining the most efficient method to meet the immediate, emergency needs of war-affected persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Displaced Persons and Refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA), renewed fighting displaced 46% of Monrovia's pre-April 6 population of 780,000. Most IDPs congregated in temporary shelters in the U.S. Embassy's residential Greystone Compound, in the Barclay Training Center (BTC), and on Bushrod Island in warehouses, schools, and sites near ECOMOG installations. Some have returned to their homes, some have moved to established camps, while others have fled Monrovia or left Liberia altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From April to mid-August, the IDP population at the Greystone compound fluctuated between an estimated 7,000 - 20,000, depending on the security situation. USAID/BHR/OFDA's Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), with the remaining international NGO, U.N., and local NGO staff provided food, water and sanitation improvements, and emergency medical care for the displaced population at Greystone. IDPs have now left Greystone to return to their homes or to move to established camps in Monrovia. An estimated 20,000 displaced persons also sought shelter in the BTC during the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNDHA's Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Office in Liberia (UNHACO) reports that over 7,500 IDPs fleeing fighting in the Tubmanburg area were registered in the Po River area in the month of June. Fighting in the area has prevented humanitarian access since the beginning of the crisis. On September 8 and 9, a U.N./NGO mission assessed conditions in Tubmanburg, where about 60% of an estimated 35,000 people are suffering from severe malnutrition, including 4,000 children. Subsequent assessments found that due to the presence of fighters, much of the population returned to the bush after receiving food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP estimates that about 2,000 Liberian civilians fleeing fighting in Grand Gedeh county have crossed the border to Tabou, Cote d'Ivoire. UNHCR reports that 4,000 - 6,000 Sierra Leoneans in Liberia and 2,000 Liberians have fled to Zimmi, Sierra Leone to escape fighting in Grand Cape Mount County.  According to UNHCR, the 15,000 - 20,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in Monrovia have expressed a desire to return to Sierra Leone. In May, UNHCR reported some 5,000 new refugees in Cote d'Ivoire's Danane and Guiglo regions who fled renewed NPFL-LPC conflict northeast of Gbarnga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several ships carrying Liberian refugees berthed in Sierra Leone and Ghana.  A Russian freighter, the Zolotitsa, carrying 434 passengers including Liberians, Ghanaians, Nigerians, Guineans, and Sierra Leoneans, returned to Monrovia on June 18 after three weeks at sea. The Zolotitsa was denied permission to dock in Togo and Ghana, despite appeals by U.S. Embassies and by UNHCR. The passengers were in good condition when they returned to Monrovia, where WFP arranged for food and temporary shelter until trucks were made available to those wishing to return to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food and Agriculture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP's program of expanded targeted food distribution to displaced shelters in Monrovia continues, with the help of international and local NGOs. WFP, with Save the Children Fund/UK (SCF/UK) and local NGOs, has also provided food- for-work projects in Monrovia to collect garbage, rehabilitate Spriggs Payne Airfield, construct emergency latrines, exhume and re-bury bodies, and ensure continuous functioning of hospitals, orphanages, the electricity corporation, telephone company, and the White Plains water facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In areas outside Monrovia, WFP delivered food by ship and overland convoy to Buchanan, Kakata, Totota, Phoebe Hospital, near Gbarnga, Voinjama, and Suehn. In addition, WFP has provided food cross-border from Cote d'Ivoire. On September 10, WFP began trucking in food for distribution to severely malnourished inhabitants of Tubmanburg, who had been foraging for leaves, wild yams, palm nuts and palm cabbage for the past seven months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From July 1-5, representatives of UNHCR, WFP, the European Union (E.U.), NGOs, BHR's Office of Food for Peace (BHR/FFP), and the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (State/PRM) met in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire to plan for 1997 food assistance to Liberian and Sierra Leonean refugees and IDPs. The current regional food program was divided into two sub- regional projects. The Liberia Protracted Relief Operation (PRO) will assist IDPs in Liberia; Liberian refugees in Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, and Ghana; and Sierra Leone refugees in Liberia. The Sierra Leone PRO will address the needs of Sierra Leonean IDPs, Liberian refugees in Sierra Leone, and Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP closed its warehouses from July 12-16 and suspended food distributions due to crowds at the port which swarmed its warehouses and stole food. The WFP country director held a series of meetings with ECOMOG, the national port authority, and national police to improve security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nutritional survey of children under five years of age in Monrovia conducted by Action Contre la Faim/France (ACF/F), MOH, UNICEF, United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), and the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) in mid-July found high levels of malnutrition in both resident children and displaced children living in camps. Fifteen percent of resident children experienced global malnutrition, while 4% experienced severe malnutrition. Of the displaced children, almost 25% experienced global malnutrition and 7% experienced severe malnutrition. ACF/F and Medecins Sans Frontieres International (MSF/I) each set up four therapeutic feeding centers in Monrovia in response to the malnutrition findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other nutritional surveys conducted by ACF/F in August found high levels of malnutrition in children under five years of age. In Buchanan, 47.6% experienced global malnutrition, while 5.6% experienced severe malnutrition.  A survey in Gbarnga, Bong County found global malnutrition in 26.8% and severe malnutrition in 9.7% of children. ACF/F operates therapeutic and supplementary feeding centers in Buchanan, Gbarnga, and Kakata.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To combat the malnutrition problem, NGOs such as ACF/F, MSF/I, SCF/UK, and CARE, have begun a 3-month plan of action which will focus on the rural areas of upper Margibi, lower Bong, and Grand Bassa counties. The plan includes a temporary increase in emergency food distributions to the affected areas, increased monitoring by both ACF/F and MSF/I, expanded therapeutic and supplementary feeding programs for malnourished children, and crop assessments to address insufficient food production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catholic Relief Services (CRS), Lutheran World Relief (LWR), the E.U., WFP, BHR/OFDA, and BHR/FFP implemented an agricultural recovery program originally planned before fighting began in April. The program was to provide 25 kg of seeds and 25 kg of bulgar wheat per family to some 57,600 farm families.  According to CRS, 610 MT of rice seed from Cote d'Ivoire, and 797 MT from Guinea, was distributed in Nimba and Bong counties. Bong Mines, Buchanan, and Montserrado county received 317 MT of seed from Monrovia. Oxfam had already distributed 100 MT of seed to Sinoe county before the April crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water and Sanitation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The E.U. delivered enough water treatment chemicals to the White Plains water facility to last until February 1997. Piped water is now available for ten hours a day excluding Sunday for those living on Bushrod Island, which holds 25% of the population of Monrovia. The rest of the population depend on dug wells, which are susceptible to pollution. UNICEF is coordinating with the International Committee of the Red Cross, and NGOs to disinfect over 5, 000 wells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of a functioning sewage system, most communities and all shelter residents depend on in- ground latrines. At present, most shelter latrines have been filled and residents resort to emergency latrines and the surrounding bush, deteriorating already poor sanitary conditions. The new UNICEF de-sludging truck was looted and two Liberia Water and Sewage Company (LWSC) trucks were severely damaged and stripped of parts. One of the trucks has been repaired.  SCF/UK recovered its garbage trucks and is working with the Monrovia City Corporation and the MOH to haul away refuse.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health In Monrovia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John F. Kennedy (JFK), Swede Relief, Redemption, and St. Joseph's Catholic hospitals are functioning but the ELWA hospital is closed. ELWA's international staff were evacuated and the hospital was looted. The U.N.  Development Program's Office for Project Services (UNOPS) recently restored electricity to JFK Hospital for 21 hours daily. Buchanan hospital is still functioning at a very low level, and is short on supplies and staff.  Tubmanburg hospital was completely looted, and virtually no medical services are available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five cholera referral facilities in Monrovia reported a decline in possible cholera cases beginning in mid- August. However, from April to mid-August, referral facilities reported over 5,000 cases of severe diarrhea in Monrovia.  Samples were sent to Abidjan and Europe for cholera testing. U.N. agencies, NGOs, and government officials established a Cholera Control Committee, with sub-committees to deal with information and education, body disposal, water and sanitation, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Measles cases are also increasing, but not at an alarming rate. According to the U.N., UNICEF and NGOs administered 18,500 vaccination doses to 5,000 children and 2,500 women from mid-April to July 1. An estimated 25,000 cases of measles have been treated since the crisis began. ACF/F is operating mother and child health (MCH) centers and health centers for children under five years of age in Buchanan and Gbarnga. MSF/I is providing teams to work in the outpatient departments of Swede Relief and Redemption hospitals in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although MSF/I officially closed its program in Lofa county in April 1996, volunteer community health workers continue to collect weekly medical data which is analyzed by MSF/I staff in Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire. In July, similar surveillance networks were established in Nimba, Bong, and upper Margibi counties. Although mortality rates for children under five years of age have improved in upper Lofa, data from Nimba, Bong, and upper Margibi show a high mortality rate, attributed to malnutrition and diarrhea. In upper Margibi, the mortality rate is 22.02% and in Bong county, the rate is 7.9%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In FY 1996, the U.S. Department of State and Department of Defense contributed $40 million in logistical support to ECOMOG. BHR/FFP is supporting WFP and CRS in food aid distributions throughout Liberia, including cross-border distributions to Bong and Nimba counties. BHR/FFP will also continue USG food aid shipments to the region in support of WFP and CRS efforts to distribute assistance to the war-affected populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In FY 1996, USAID's Bureau for West African Affairs (AFR/WA) is assisting war victims (including IDPs, child soldiers, widows, orphans, and disabled ex- combatants) through trauma counseling, skills development, non-formal education, and provision of agricultural kits. AFR/WA is also providing education kits to schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April and May, BHR/OFDA sent a DART, with expertise in public health, water, sanitation, and logistics, to Monrovia to assist the U.S. Embassy in the management of the humanitarian emergency and to address the needs of IDPs at the U.S. Embassy Greystone compound. In FY 1996, BHR/OFDA has provided funding to seven NGOs working in Liberia in the areas of agricultural assistance, emergency water and sanitation programs, medical assistance, nutritional feeding programs, food and non-food distributions, and to UNDHA for support of UNHACO. BHR/OFDA supports the international community's strategy of targeted interventions using &quot;minimum inputs for maximum impact&quot; until the Liberian Interim Government and factions unequivocally guarantee security, neutrality, and unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance.  BHR/OFDA exchanges information with the European Union regarding funding activities to avoid duplication and ensure a unified strategy.</SPAN></P>
