A group of heavily armed men, suspected to be separatist guerrillas, entered Akata village in western Assam and were about to cross the Brahmaputra River, when they were stopped by villagers. When the villagers questioned them, the guerrillas lobbed a grenade, killing three villagers instantly, said Khagen Sharma, Assam's inspector general of police. The rebels fled across the river and entered nearby Sialkonda village, where they shot and killed another civilian. The guerrillas were attacked by an irate mob and four militants were killed in the clash, Sharma said. The clashes occurred in Assam's Dhubri district, 270 kilometers west of Gauhati, the state capital. The number of civilians killed was later revised four.","Assam State","Dhubri district","26.106243","89.997638","POINT (89.997638 26.106243)","167580","India","Asia","1","1","2003-11-08","2003-11-08","0","0","4","0","4","4","4","IND","750","IND"

(...) 
Elsewhere two policemen, two militants and two civilians were killed in violence on Monday, they added.

Indian security officials say violence and infiltration in Kashmir has increased in recent weeks, despite thick snow on mountain passes on Kashmir border. For security reasons, voting has been staggered over five phases in Kashmir, where separatist militants have called for a boycott. They say New Delhi is trying to boost the legitimacy of its rule in the region by holding elections. India's general election is being held between April 16 and May 13. State polls in the troubled Himalayan region last year had a turnout of more than 60 percent, though many saw it as a vote for better governance rather than acceptance of Indian rule.

Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the disputed region since an anti-India insurgency broke out in 1989. But violence involving Indian troops and Muslim militants, has declined significantly since India and Pakistan launched a peace process in 2004. New Delhi paused that dialogue after the Mumbai attacks last November, when 10 gunmen rampaged through India's business capital, killing almost 170 people.""","4","Jammu and Kashmir State","Jammu and Kashmir","Jammu and Kashmir State",,"33.91667","76.66667","POINT (76.666670 33.916670)","178354","India","Asia","1","1","2009-04-20","2009-04-20","1","1","0","0","2","2","2","IND","750","IND"

Passage will be very difficult during the rainy season. There is no village close to the camp. The closest water supply is a small spring about 1 km away. Latrines have been built by the refugees.
