<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - The International Livestock Research Institute says it is making efforts to make the tropical Bos Indicus cattle or Zebu more efficient in producing food from available feeds as it is biologically possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The institute, which has centers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Nairobi, Kenya said in a recent publication that &quot;investigations are in the process to determine how energy on the back (of Zebu) can profitably be converted into more meat or milk without compromising their adaptive strategies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since no cow has yet been designed to produce milk without a calf, the institute said, the challenge for researchers was &quot;to improve nutrient utilization by Zebus in a way that would enable them to have calves more frequently and also milk per lactation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, the institute provides national cross-breeding programmes with information on the productive and adaptive traits of indeginous breeds to enable them select those which need to be conserved in more efficient production systems or sperm banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Once researchers understand the exact nature of the trade-off between adaptation and productivity in tropical Zebus, they will be able to select for those individuals that are genetically predisposed to increase their outputs of meat and milk,&quot; the institute said in an article published in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new interest in the Zebu follows the disappointing performance of high-producing exotic Taurine breeds in the tropics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Exposed to high disease challenge and insufficient feed, the institute said, the productivity of exotic breeds &quot;decreases markedly, and many eventually succumb to environmental stress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Exotic cattle crossbred with Bos Indicus are hadier than the pure ones &quot;thanks to specific adaptive traits inherited from their local parents. But they require substantial feed and veterinary inputs to survive and to maintain reasonable high productivity in tropical environments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Crossbred cattle are liked by farmers in the cool East African highlands, particularly Kenya where they are used for traction and milk production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia recently imported 100 crossbred cows from Kenya for on-farm testing of their performance as traction and milk-producing animals, the institute said in the article published by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Millions of Africans are expected to be saved from river blindness under a joint international medical programme launched Tuesday in Washington at a conference hosted by the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> River blindness, which is caused by a black fly that thrives in fast-flowing rivers, is a debilitating disease that also causes severe itching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A World Bank statement obtained Tuesday by PANA in Lusaka said that the African Programme for Onchocerciasis control (APOC), will implement community-based drug treatment programmes in 16 African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The programme will be jointly carried out by governments, non-governmental development organizations, bilateral donors, and international agencies, including the World Bank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A drug called 'Mectizan' is to be donated by its discoverer, Merck and Compnay of the United States to use in the anti river blindness campaign which is modelled on the highly successful Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP), established in 1974 to eliminate river blindness in 11 countries in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The goal is the elimination of onchocerciasis as a major public health problem and impediment to socio-economic development throughout Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, nearly 100 million people are at risk of the disease and 15 million are infected in the 16 countries to be covered by the new programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Over the next generation, apoc will add 10 million years of productive labour to the 16 African countries covered by the programme and, by way of OCP, we know that the tools exist and the international collaboration can be garnered to fully control the disease and achieve results,&quot; World Bank President James Wolfensohn is quoted as saying at the launch of the programme Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control has been made possible by donor nations, sponsoring international organizations and a coalition of 11 non-governmental organisations to eradicate the disease from the rest of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The programme will be implemented in a broad swath containing parts of 16 countries and running from Cameroon to Ethiopia in the east and then south to Angola and Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is based on the OCP which is on the verge of eliminating river blindness in 11 West African countries with a population of 32 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world bank was instrumental in the creation of the OCP and continues to play a major role as a leading sponsor and its second-largest donor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OCP, in addition to controlling the carrier of the disease (the blackfly) using a method called &quot;vector control,&quot; uses a drug called 'Mectizan' (generically known as Ivermectin), donated by Merck and Co., Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Merck announced in 1987 that it would give the drug free to approved river blindness programmes &quot;for as long as needed to as many as need it.&quot; Currently some 13 million people are being treated with donated supplies of Mectizan, a number which will vastly increase with the new programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The non-profit Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia, houses the Mectizan expert committee, which approves supply of the drug for major programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mectizan donation programme, which oversees the drug's distribution, is also located at the Carter Center. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter personally supports, and has been active in promoting the APOC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In particular, he and the carter center support the model of global partnership for disease control throughout Africa represented by this new programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the OCP, the APOC will be co-sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Food and Agriculture Organization, World bank and the World Health Organization and will be headquartered in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we move expeditiously and begin sustained mass treatment programmes now, there is a good possibility of eventually breaking the chain of transmission and elimnating the disease as a major public health problem throughout those major parts of Africa where the disease remains endemic,&quot; said Bruce Benston, head of the world bank's onchocerciasis unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> River blindness, as it is commonly referred to or onchocerciasis is an ancient scourge spread by the bite of the tiny but aggressive blackfly. After the bite, parasites laid under the skin mature from larvae into thread-like adult male and female worms that live in nodules, ugly bumps under the skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The adult worms mate, giving birth to millions of immature worms that migrate to all part of the body. They may either die after living up to 30 months or be ingested by a female blackfly when she needs a meal of blood and then, after evolving into another stage, be transmitted to another human when the blackfly needs another meal. And the cycle begins all over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The immature worms cause havoc in the human body. Their presence and death cause rashes and unbearable itching. Over the years the skin becomes swollen and thickened, and there is often depigmentation leaving white patches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With repeated infections, the disease becomes more severe. The immature worms also get into the eyes where they cause inflammation and scars which, over time, lead to permanent blindness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Are you a resident of Lagos? If you are, then rush to your physician to check the level of carbon monoxide in your blood system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two separate medical studies here have revealed that city dwellers in Nigeria carry abnormally high levels of that gas in their blood stream due to air pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to medical experts, exceptionally high levels of carbon monoxide in the blood stream pose health hazards associated with shortness of breath, headache, fatigue, respiratory failure, unconsciousness and in some cases can lead to death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The acceptable international standard of the gas is 1.5 per cent, but the studies at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMIR), Lagos, and the engineering department of the University of Lagos, revealed a high level of between seven and 10 per cent in the system of people they studied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Gabriel Uko of the NIMIR said his three-member team arrived at their conclusion after a study involving 60 adults. The motive was originally to establish that cigarette smoking increased the level of carbon monoxide in the blood stream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the researchers discovered that smokers and non-smokers alike used in the study, manifested higher-than-normal concentrations of between seven and 10 per cent of the gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also Dr. Olufunso Akindele of the engineering department of the the Lagos University said their own research had focused on pollution from engines of automobiles, especially second-hand vehicles imported from Europe, popularly known as &quot;Tokunbos&quot; in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the study showed that vehicles with faulty or worn-out engines, for which Lagos, Nigeria's economic capital is notorious, are a major source of carbon monoxide emission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The research also found out that vehicles with poor cooling systems operate at high temperatures resulting in the formation of exhaust pollution.  This problem is worse during traffic jams, for which Lagos, with a population of about six million people, is also famous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources of the harmful gas in the blood stream, include emissions from exhaust system of automobiles, refuse burns, cigarette smoke and related pollutants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Medical experts warn that while 10 per cent level of carbon monoxide could still be considered &quot;mild&quot;, long-term exposure to air pollution is potentially dangerous. The risk could be extended through blood transfusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a solution, Akindele of the University of Lagos suggests that second-hand vehicles be made to carry an exhaust re-cycling device to reduce temperature generated within the engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other sources of pollution, including smoking, he added should also be checked to improve health and life expectancy, currently put at 48 years for men and 50 for women in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Panafrican News Agency<BR>December 1, 1995<BR>by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Researchers have identified natural substances in human cells that appear to slow the progression of Aids and that may open new avenues for treating the deadly disease, the latest issue of the Washington Line newsletter has reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the United States State Department publication, the researchers report that they have isolated several molecules secreted by a class of infection-fighting cells known as CD8s. These immune-system cells are thought to play a critical role in controlling the Aids-causing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during early stages of infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The findings will be published in the 15 December issue of the journal 'Science.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We identified this family (of molecules) and found that they are very powerful,&quot; said Dr Robert Gallo, the director of the New Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is something happening here,&quot; said Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. &quot;There is no question that this is door-opening time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest discovery was made by a team headed by Gallo and Paolo Lusso of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan, Italy. The research was conducted at the National Cancer Institute Laboratory in Bethesda, Maryland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aids researchers around the world have been trying to identify the natural HIV-fighting chemicals since 1989 when researchers at the University of California at San Francisco found that the body's CD8 immune system cells produced molecules that appeared to suppress the ability of HIV to copy itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gallo and his team isolated three such molecules -- called rantes, MIP1-alpha and MIP1-beta -- that they believe work in concert to suppress HIV replication. The researchers found during testing that the molecules shut down several different strains of HIV reproduction as well reproduction of the Simian immunodefiiciency virus, a virus that causes Aids in monkeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All three molecules are known as chemokines secreted proteins involved in the body's wound-healing process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Immunologist Sergio Romagnani of the University of Florence called the findings very convincing. &quot;It provides direct evidence that the CD8 suppression of HIV is mediated by these chemokines,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another study published in the British journal Nature', a team at the Paul Ehrlick Institute in Langen, Germany, led by Reinhard Durth, reported the discovery of a different and apparently less powerful HIV-suppressing factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fauci, after reviewing both studies, said he found the Gallo group's results especially convincing because &quot;Gallo is getting really impressive suppression at low concentrations (of chemokines), and in the Kurth paper the concentrations are much higher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gallo said that while scientists do not yet know exactly how chemokines suppress HIV, they may still learn how HIV causes disease by studying their mechanism of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gallo said that if the chemokines prove to be non-toxic in animal tests now underway, then they could possibly be used to control HIV for long periods of time in infected patients. The ultimate goal is to begin human clinical trials at Gallo's New Institute and at the San Rafaele Institute in Milan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One cautionary note is that prior research with CD8 cells found that their level of HIV-suppressing activity appeared to decline as HIV-infected patients progressed to full-blown AIDS. Gallo said, however, that it may be possible to boost the body's production of HIV-suppressing chemicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marc Girard of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, a leader of the French Aids vaccine effort, said that while it is too early to tell whether the chemokines will have practical applications, he is optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You open a new window in the wall, and then you have to look through the window to see what you see,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a whole new landscape out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - The recent refugee summit in Cairo and the verbal war between the president of South Africa and the Nigerian military government are the top stories in Africa this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cairo meeting of four African leaders and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter made headlines in the Times of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state-owned newspaper said that the conference, which aimed to find a solution to years of ethnic fighting in Burundi and Rwanda was &quot;without doubt a step in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Bujumbura weekly, L'Independant, said Burundian politicians should have stayed away from the summit because it was engineered by parties that were not impartial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The face-off between South African President Nelson Mandela and Nigerian military leader Sani Abacha also received attention from the The Guardian, a private Lagos daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pointing to the execution of the nine Ogoni activists in Nigeria, the paper said that although there was nothing strange about the soured diplomatic relations between the two leaders, it is &quot;worrisome&quot; that Abacha and Mandela resorted to name-calling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because South Africans and Nigerians have shed blood for democracy and basic human rights, the paper said &quot;It is quite in order that a threat to these essential values, this time in Nigeria, should be the subject of engaging disputation between the two countries.&quot; It added that the destiny and values of the black people are at issue here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paper said that no matter what Nigeria's relations are now with South Africa, Mandela, with his heroic glow, &quot;illuminates the perception of every person and nation about Africa and black people everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans, it said, were eager to see both nations working together to emancipate the continent and raise its reckoning in the global scheme of things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For this reason, the two leaders can ill-afford the furor bordering on name-calling,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another political squabble surfacing in African editorials this week was the quarrel that Libya picked up with Mauritania for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Libya attacked this development through its official press and the official Mauritanian News Agency, AMI, responded Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Kadafi is badly placed to speak in the name of the Palestinain cause, and even less so claim to be their defender, since his has expelled thousands of Palestinians from Libya,&quot; AMI said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It added that Kadafi condemned the rapprochement with Israel while asking the Turkish prime prime minister &quot;to intercede on Libya's behalf with Tel Aviv&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KADOMA, Zimbabwe - Southern Africa is forging a unified strategy to fight malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During a recent workshop in Kadoma, Zimbabwe, the World Health Organization in Africa announced a combat plan to malaria experts from the Southern African Development Community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization said that past failure to sustain control strategies cannot be repeated. It has designed training materials for district health teams that attend to 70-80 percent of all malaria cases in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The training will last from the year 1996 to 2000 and will reduce the incidence of malaria by at least 20 percent in 1977, the organization said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ei Hadi Benzerough, the organization's malaria expert said that malaria produces a considerable impact on the health of African children, mostly during the first five years of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This increases the susceptibility to other infections,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a curable disease malaria continues to kill between 1.5 and 2.7 million Africans every year and causes debilitating clinical illnesses to 300-500 million other people in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In some countries such as Malawi many malaria victims are resistant to the most effective anti-malaria drug, chloroquinem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe Health Minister Timothy Stamps said about four million Zimbabweans are exposed to malaria each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Participants at the workshop said that the prevailing drought in southern Africa, although temporary, is helping to reduce the spread of malaria because mosquitos, the vectors for the disease, need water to lay their eggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the early 1990s malaria epidemics have been reported in Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COTONOU, Benin - French President Jacques Chirac was expected in Benin Friday to join 29 other leaders attending the twice-yearly meeting which groups France and 46 other French-speaking countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chirac will inaugurate Friday a news conference centre which is the venue of the summit which begins Saturday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre cost 4.8 billion CFA francs (about 9.6 million dollars), of which France contributed 3 billion CFA Francs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Francophone foreign ministers ended their pre-summit meetings Thursday after the adoption of a number of resolutions to be submitted to the heads of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benin foreign minister and chairman of the conference, Edgar-Yves Monnou, said the forum discussed the situation in Rwanda and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria is said to be seeking to become a member of the 'Francophone commonwealth' after it was suspended from the British-led Commonwealth because of its abuse of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Francophone countries cannot go beyond what the international community has already done, Monnou said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was referring to the suspension and other sanctions slapped on Nigeria in the wake of the recent hanging of nine Ogoni minority rights leaders including author Ken Saro-Wiwa by the military regime in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministers conference approved Wednesday a proposal to appoint a secretary general to oversee the actitivies of the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The secretary-general, who would also be the Francophone official spokesperson, will be elected at the seventh summit in 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUJUMBURA, Burundi - Eight moderate Hutus were killed in Ngozi, northern Burundi, this week in an unending political feud, the official news agency, ABP, reported Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency blamed the assassinations on the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People, a violent underground movement that targets the Tutsi minority in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unknown persons have circulated leaflets warning Hutu moderates to stop collaborating with Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army and with the local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Hutu, who comprise 85 percent of the country's 6.02 million people, dominate the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The army has been making continuous purges to rid the country of anti-government militias, termed officially here as bandits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a related incident, six Tutsi schoolchidren and five displaced Hutus were shot dead Thursday in two separate attacks at the Bubanza Technical Training School, in northwest Burundi, and in a nearby camp hosting displaced persons, the army said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting between the army and unidentified militias took place Wednesday in Bujumbura. Independent estimates say 100 militiamen and one soldier were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, state-run Radio Burundi reported Thursday that 20 attackers were killed and several others wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attacks come in the wake of a recent four-nation summit in Cairo to end the ethnic carnage in Burundi and neighboring Rwanda, brokered by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting between militias and the Burundi army has now escalated to include militia sabotage of state-owned infrastructure such as hydro-electric dams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, Bujumbura, has been without electricity for a month. This has seriously affected the economic sector, which Hutu extremists claim has been dominated by the Tutsi for decades.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amoako said he has begun consultations with some African leaders on how best to make the commission's work more cost effective in areas where it can make a measurable impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will also try to forge closer links with its partners, non-governmental organizations and other U.N. agencies, to enable the commission its play role in Africa's development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ECA, based in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, was established by the United Nations on April 29, 1958 to promote economic and social development in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Africa is lagging behind in its trade with Germany while other developing countries in Asia and Latin America are recording double-digit growth in their trade with the European economic giant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa was the only region whose trade with Germany stagnated in 1994... or in some cases even declined slightly,&quot; according to the latest edition of the German information service Inter Nationes Bonn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting a study by the Hamburg-based Institute for Economic Research, the report said African accounted for about 11 per cent of Germany's trade with the developing world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said Germany imported goods worth some 11,800 million deutschmarks from African countries in 1994, and exported goods worth 9,700 million (about 6,930 million U.S. dollars)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although this represents a trade surplus of some 2,100 million deutschmarks in Africa's favour, the report noted that Asia and Latin America were doing better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Texiles and clothing dominated German imports from the developing countries, accounting for 50 per cent while minerals, agricultural products and leather items were the other major imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However at the country level Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, recorded a trade surplus with Germany of 636 million deutschmarks in 1994, more than double the 1993 figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report said the country's impressive trade figures with Germany were partly due to oil exports and positive results from the bilateral technical assistance projects between both countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria exported goods worth 1,440 million deutschmarks in 1994, nearly the same level in the previous year, while its German imports dropped by about 30 percent to 805.3 million deutschmarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Germany is regarded as one of the world's largest importer of goods from developing countries, with a total import of some 76,000 million deutschmarks in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 27 countries including 11 from Africa took part in the Import Fair'95 organized by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in its efforts to promote exports.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNITED NATIONS - American, British and German diplomats at the United Nations have started negotiations to extend the stay of the multinational U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR). The mission's current mandate ends Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali announced Monday plans for the withdrawal of the 2,190-member force starting Friday. His report said the Rwandan government was opposed to the extension of the mission's mandate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But diplomats from the United States and the two European countries were reported to be consulting with Rwanda's permanent representative to the United Nations, Manzi Bakuramutsa, in an effort to persuade the his government to change its stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the meeting said Tuesday the ambassador had asked for time to consult his government on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As part of the 'Save-Rwanda' effort, interested countries are also said to have started drafting a resolution that will modify the mission's mandate to focus on assisting the central African country in its reconstruction and rehabilitation, as well as in the repatriation of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rwandan government insisted it will allow the mission to continue its operations only on those grounds, rather than its present involvement in providing security and facilitating reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boutros-Ghali said in his report a continued presence could help to build confidence among the 1.6 million Rwandan refugees in Zaire and other countries and encourage them to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is in this context that a large part of the international community believes that a further six-month extension of the current mandate of UNAMIR is desirable,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNAMIR, which comprises troops from 27 nations, was deployed last year after the massacre of an estimated 500,000 to one million people, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus, by elements of the former Rwandan government forces and militias. The government was dominated by Hutus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambian soccer has become dangerous. Coach John Shinde of Power Dynamos, the 1994 Premier League champions, would be the first to admit this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shinde, whose team is based in Kitwe, the soccer-crazy northern copper-mining town, was Friday reported to have &quot;gone into hiding for fear of his life.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Saturday Dynamos lost 0-1 to Nchanga Rangers from neigboring Chingola mining town. An agitated fan could not stomach the defeat. He followed the coach and threatened him with a revolver.<BR> Shinde told reporters at his home in Kitwe that since the incident he has felt as if he has been placed &quot;under house arrrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He accosted me just outside the changing rooms as I was about to leave.  He pulled out the revolver and pointed it at me. I was scared stiff,&quot; he told journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A day after Dynamos lost the match, four other supporters went to Shinde's house and beat up his cousin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is okay when they call you names and harass you in other ways but going to the extent of showing you a revolver is just too much, I could not believe my eyes when it happened,&quot; a frightened Shinde narrated Thursday, before going underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shinde is a victim of what appears to be Zambian soccer fans' new &quot;strategy&quot; to get their teams to win matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) closed Nchanga Rangers' stadium because of &quot;unruly behavior&quot; by the home team supporters who are notorious for harassing visiting teams, and sometimes their own players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The closure followed an earlier incident of assault on Power Dynamos players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another recent incident of soccer hooliganism, Kabwe Warriors fans in the midlands town of Kabwe invaded the pitch in which their players were training. The fans threatened to stone the players if they lost the upcoming matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this year Nkana supporters were blamed for &quot;going a bit too far&quot; when they threatened to paralyze operations at the local copper mine to protest the team's persistent defeats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the team's supporters club, most of whom are miners, later forced Nkana mine's general manager Earnest Pilula to explain the company's plans to reverse the team's dwindling fortunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This led to the sacking of team coach Ben Bamfuchile. His replacement is a veteran former national soccer team defender &quot;Gentil&quot; Kapambwe Mulenga, one of Nkana's own original products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before that, on two occassions, the irate Nkana fans had ambushed and stoned their own players and a visiting team to show their disgust over match losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now it appears the new strategy has paid dividends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nchanga Rangers have managed to avert relegation to a lower division next year after a rather shaky start this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkana has also jumped into the top eight bracket on the elite league and so has Kabwe Warriors which is lying 4th from the top with 46 points from 28 games so far played. They still have two games for the season.<BR> Wanderers and Dynamos are fighting to represent Zambia in the 1996 Africa Club Champions Cup and hopefully Shinde could &quot;come out of hiding&quot; by then if he manages to get his team retain the league title.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - Anybody wondering why African leaders needed to attend the sixth Francophone summit could find the answer in the editorial pages of local newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit that closed in Benin on Monday is perceived as France's attempt to get Rwanda to accept orders as a condition for French recognition, and a lot of space was devoted to the the ironies of the Nigeria-South Africa conflict. Even the politics of a gas pipeline project in Nigeria were loudly addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The thrice-weekly Kinshasa paper in Zaire, La Tempete Des Tropiques, the city's Le Potentiel, and the Cotonou newspapers in Benin, La Nation and Le Matin, all commented on the Francophone conference that closed in Benin Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> La Tempete Des Tropiques asked if African leaders attending the conference realized that their presence actually encouraged French domination of the French-speaking world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Why are Africans not ridding themselves of this?&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides continuing to support dictatorships in Africa, the paper said the genocide in Rwanda is a clear example of what French presence has done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ugandan press criticized the tough conditions France set to normalize relations with Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, the conditions include a blanket amnesty for all but 10 perpetrators of the genocide in the country, a reforming of the army to include half of soldiers under the ruling power and half from the ousted government army, as well as the rotation of the army command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France also said that if Rwanda stops criticizing its government, lets refugees return to their former host countries, accepts French as the official language, France would arrest some perpetrators of the genocide and promote a regional conference that would give proper recognition to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The whole business sounds incredibly far-fetched but as the saying goes, truth is stranger than fiction,&quot; said the state-owned New Vision. &quot; It is now up to the French government to confirm or deny...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rwandan government, it continued, was grappling with &quot;huge problems&quot; and France should know that &quot;a solution cannot be imposed from outside by a foreign government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Le Potentiel said that the summit did achieve its major goal, which was to guarantee French as a linguistic and cultural diversity in Francophone countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another gain was the collective desire to see Francophone grow into a worldwide political force. But this objective, it said, had its own limitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arguement Le Potential did pose, joined by the privately-owned Benin newspaper Le Matin, was that the political force of Francophone influence goes back to the legacy of French culture and has its own limitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Le Matin noted that a resolution at the summit asked that the movement be more involved in conflict prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Suppose other linguistic groups adopt specific ways of settling their conflicts, what would become of the OAU and the UN?&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pro-government Cotonou daily, La Nation, said that the moderation of political resolutions adopted, especially on Nigeria and Rwanda, &quot;clearly shows how difficult it is to get consensus on major delicate issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state-owned Zambia Daily Mail, published in Lusaka, said sanctions against Nigeria for the hanging of nine minority rights activists is ironic in that South Africa is now leading that campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From the see-saw verbal battles now raging it might be possible to state that African countries stand to eventually lose for isolating one of their kind over a matter which the Nigerians erroneously view as 'internal',&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The political and economic pressure on Nigeria, it continued, &quot;must be a strong pointer to the fact that Africa will no longer tolerate&quot; the violation of human rights under the guise of dealing with law breakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For its part, the privately-owned Nigerian paper Vanguard picked up attempts by Britain and South Africa to get the Shell Petroleum company to pull out of the country's liquefied natural gas project. This is part of the campaign to punish the country for the executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We believe that the LNG project, which has already suffered much delay, is a laudable project which is both for the benefit of the oil producing areas and the nation in general,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project, it said, would mean significant reduced gas flaring -- a major cause of pollution in the producing areas -- and environmental degradation. It would also increase Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings.<BR> TMP002</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As shares continued their record-breaking, the exchange here listed market capitalization of companies that topped one trillion rand (about 275 billion dollars) for the first time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - The recent executions of nine Ogoni minority rights campaigners has excerbated the internal political crisis in Nigeria and further alienated the country's military government from the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hue-and-cry generated by the recent hangings also threatens the fragile unity in the marginalized African continent, according to political analysts in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of particular worry to pan-Africanists is the deepening diplomatic row between Nigeria and South africa over the hangings. The two are the continent's potential great nations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The political row threatens to overshadow Nigeria's moral and material contributions to world peace and, perhaps most importantly, the decolonization of Africa and the anti-apartheid struggle in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crisis follows the dismal democratizing and human rights records of successive military governments that have ruled the populous West African country for 25 of its 35 years of nationhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many would not disagree with Nigerian Information Minister Walter Ofonagoro that &quot;nobody can ignore a country with 100 million people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But independent observers also insist that Nigeria must get its act together to remain relevant as a strong force among the comity of nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's international rating took a steep dive in the aftermath of the decision by the previous military regime of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida to cancel the June 1993 presidential election, widely believed to hasve been won by millionaire-politician Moshood Abiola and which international observers judged to be free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two years on, the measures imposed on Nigeria by some Western nations after the poll cancellation have continued to haunt the current military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha, who took power on Nov. 17, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola, who defied the Abacha regime by declaring himself president in June 1994, is in detention awaiting trial for treason. Abacha insists his trial must go ahead despite appeals to release him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, Nigeria's former military ruler Olusegun Obasanjo and his former deputy Maj.Gen. Musa Shehu Yar'adua are among 40 people in jail after they were convicted last March for plotting to overthrow the Abacha regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sentences passed on the 40, ranging from life to death, were however commuted after a flood of clemency pleas from within and outside Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha regime apparently feeling it would lose authority succumbing to another bout of appeals for clemency, ratified the death sentences passed on the nine minority rights leaders, among them writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sanctions and threats of more punitive measures have poured from across the globe following the execution Nov. 10 of the nine minority rights leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But what has surprised Nigerian officials has been the strong stance adopted by South African President Nelson Mandela, who has personally undertaken to lead the international campaign for Nigeria's isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At one stage the diplomatic row degenerated into name-calling between Mandela and Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation has remained tense with the Nigerian government accusing Mandela of being &quot;used&quot; and a threat to African unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But apart from South Africa and Zimbabwe, which are leading the anti-Nigeria campaigns, other African countries have been restrained in their comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a growing fear the diplomatic wranglings between Pretoria and Abuja could creep into sports, which has been a unifying tool for a continent wracked by civil strifes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following South Africa's November decision to withdraw an invitation to Nigeria for an African four-nation soccer tournament, and the perceived fear of insecurity for Nigerian players, it is unclear if Nigeria will defend the Africa Cup of Nations, for which they are champions, to be held in January in South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South Africa experienced less politically-motivated violence in 1995 compared with 1994, according to a local human rights group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's Human Rights Committee revealed Friday that the number of people killed in political violence in the country this year has plummeted to less than half the number for 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee, an independent watchdog body, announced that an average of 97 politically-related killings occured every month in 1995, compared with 223 monthly the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main hot-spot remains the troubled Kwazulu-Natal province, in which two-thirds of the country's political deaths occurred this year.  Nevertheless, the monthly death-toll in Kwazulu-Natal has also dropped by a half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national death-toll in political violence in November was 54 -- significantly below the monthly average for 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The continued presence of the police and the army in trouble spots,&quot; said the committee, &quot;is an important factor which, taken together with with the political will of the Inkatha Freedom Party to demonstrate the province is governable, helps to provide and explanation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the committee pointed out that while deaths in Kwazulu-Natal had dropped, political intolerance remained as high as ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The difference is that large-scale indiscriminate attacks have given way to more well-organized targeted attacks against specific individuals.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia's ruling party, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) has postponed its third national convention for two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crucial meeting in which party officials will be elected will now be held Dec. 19-21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MMD national secretary, retired Brig. Gen. Godfrey Miyanda announced in Lusaka late Friday that the convention was postponed because of logistical problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the ruling party said the party was still looking for money to hire transport to ferry delegates from across the country for the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 1,000 party members are expected to attend the convention and MMD publicity chairman Sikota Wina has said the party needed about 600,000 U.S. dollars to transport, accommodate and feed the delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The convention's business includes election of a new national executive committee and making ammendments to the party's manifesto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior MMD officials said recently the meeting, scheduled for 1996, had to be held this year &quot;to give time for the wounds to heal&quot; for leaders who would lose the party elections, so as to enable them to assist the party win the general elections next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Vice President Levy Mwanawasa is campaigning to challenge President Frederick Chiluba for the party's presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanawasa, who resigned from Chiluba's cabinet, has accused the president of derailing the party's original ideals to eliminate poverty and restore confidence in the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba is currently embroiled in a dispute over his citizenship following press claims that he was a Zairean alien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD has recommended in a draft constitution for the country that only second-generation Zambians should in future qualify to hold the office of president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political observers believe the MMD convention might decide to drop the clause to avoid possible lawsuits from injured parties should President Chiluba be retained as party president and presidential candidate for the 1996 elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Foreign and domestic investors on Zimbabwe's stock market are keenly awaiting positive signals from the government on its commitment to the second phase of market reforms launched five years ago, a major stock broking firm said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sagit Stockbrokers, said the market was also looking ahead to the appointment of a new finance minister, to replace the late Ariston Chambati, who died in October, barely five months after he took office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, progress on privatisation of loss-making public enterprises and moves to trim the government were also keenly awaited, Sagit said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are currently on an IMF (International Monetary Fund) shadow programme which is demanding the above and seems to be having some effect,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will probably be accepted back onto a full programme as they (IMF) have a lot of credibility invested in us. But if we aren't, that will give a very negative signal,&quot; Sagit said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IMF, a major backer of Zimbabwe's market reforms officially launched in 1991, in September this year suspended disbursement of crucial balance-of-payments assistance to Zimbabwe, saying it was not happy with high government spending and inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IMF board was expected to meet later this month to review measures taken by Zimbabwe, following which it was expected to recommend that lending should resume early in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other conditions, the IMF is demanding tighter government spending controls and inflation to be cut to 17 percent by mid-1996, down from 24 percent in October 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sagit said Zimbabwe stood to lose credibility in the international community if it failed to return to an IMF-supported reform programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;An example of how we are rated and what we stand to lose is given in the IFC (International Finance Corporation) report on building the private sector in Africa. For their 1995 year, Zimbabwe had the highest direct IFC loan and equity investment out of 33 African countries,&quot; Sagit said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos, Nigeria - Some 400 delegates are to attend the Nigerian All-Politician Summit scheduled for Lagos, Thursday, to draw up strategies for resolving the political and social problems of the country, organisers of the event said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking on the final arrangements for the summit, the joint secretaries of the conveners' committee, Olu Falae and Alhaji Baba told journalists in Lagos that five former top elected leaders from each of Nigeria's 30 states had been invited to the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Various groups and associations have also been invited, according to the joint secretaries who said the necessary steps had also been taken to ensure a trouble-free summit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will like to see government as our partner in this forum and we don't expect any negative response from any quarter,&quot; said Falae, a one-time secretary to Nigeria's federal government and a former presidential aspirant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Falae said a chairman would be elected from among the politicians at the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement was designed to put to rest official suspicion that the proposed summit had a hidden agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian government's special duties minister, Wada Nas, on Sunday warned that if the summit is for &quot;any hidden agenda or motive&quot;, it would be rejected outright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government had reportedly invited a cross-section of politicians to discuss Tuesday its concern about the forthcoming summit but had to postpone the meeting for the second time until after Thursday's meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts see this as a tacit approval by the military administration of the much-talked-about summit to be held in the wake of international hostility against the country's military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Criticism of the regime led by Gen. Sani Abacha for its lack of progress in returning the country to democratic rule peaked with the execution last month of nine minority rights activists, including the author, Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There's nothing sinister about the summit as was alleged in some quarters,&quot; Baba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those invited in our opinion represent some of the credible and knowledgeable leaders in the country,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Assurances given last month in Lagos by Joao Havelange, president of the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), to make a case for Nigeria to host the Under-20 World Soccer Cup in 1997 have landed on the rocks with the endorsement of Malaysia to host the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Havelange, who was in Nigeria to inspect facilities for the tournament, failed in Paris Monday night to tilt the scale in favour of the West African country as promised eager government officials during his four-day visit in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With an 11-9 vote, FIFA's executive committee agreed that the championship should be held in Malaysia as provisionally decided in 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The special vote, according Nigerian Football Association sources, became necessary after a confident Havelange failed to convince the Asian country to step down for Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Asians, reportedly backed by the Europeans, held to their guns to edge Africa out of the soccer extravaganza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sport pundits in Lagos believe this was to be expected because the FIFA meeting came exactly one week after the European Union countries slammed limited sports sanctions on Nigeria for its poor human rights record, especially the recent execution of nine minority rights activists including the author, Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They pointed out the European Union's firm resolve not to allow Nigeria to host the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Nigerians, Monday's decision was a new addition to three previous attempts to host the championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria was first considered for the 1989 tournament but failed to qualify after FIFA found it was simply not ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A provisional award for the 1991 edition to Nigeria was withdrawn after a two year-ban later clamped on the country because of discrepancies in the ages of players who represented it in previous championshps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Portugal was later granted the right to host the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1993, FIFA considered Nigeria for the 1995 edition but withdraw the offer after an outbreak of meningitis near one of the four venues of the tournament. Qatar staged the event earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The immediate reaction of Nigeria's sports minister Jim Nwobodo was to urge Nigerians to take the outcome calmly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The closeness of the result indicated Nigeria still has many friends in the world,&quot; he told journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nwobodo was howver full of appreciation to Havelange and Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), for standing by Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NIAMEY, Niger - The West Afrian state of Niger has signed a memorandum of understanding with the World bank After breaking ranks with the Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the document signed by prime minister Hama Amadou and the director of the World Bank department for West and Central Africa, Olivier Lafourcade in Niamey on Sunday, Niger will resume structural adjustment of its economy with support from the Bank and the Fund.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials said the country will immediately receive some eight billion CFA Francs (about 16 million US dollars, and 51 billion CFA, francs (about 102 million dollars) later under the bank's Enhanced Structural Adjusment Facility (ESAF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delay in reaching an agreement with the Bretton Woods institutions had hampered the implementation of several projects and discouraged donors from providing direly needed funds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investment in the social sectors -- education, health and water -- will absorb 39 percent of the resources officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ESAF is expected to increase revenue from taxes to 11 percent of GDP and rationalise public spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investment will focus on loans to to productive private sectors while public companies will be restructured.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The kwacha continued to be stable against the currencies of Zambia's three major trading partners -- the United States dollar, the South African Rand and the British Pound sterling -- this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currency dealers said the average kwacha exchange rate against the pound remained stable at 1495.88, while the average selling rate of the kwacha against the dollar stabilised at 962.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The local currency was also stable against the South African rand, exchanging at an average of 263 per rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance analysts on Tuesday attributed the stability of the local currency to recent agreements reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IMF last week granted Zambia 1.3 billion dollars loan. It is also seeking a further 800 million dollars from the Fund for balance of payments and other support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia needs to import some 557,000 tonnnes of famine relief maize this year as against the original estimate of 798,000 tonnes, according to a Southern African Development Community (SADC) report published Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia, along with other neighbouring southern African states, has suffered drought over several past rain seasons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The southern African sub-region will, meanwhile, need to import a collective total of 3.9 million tonnes of maize instead of the 7.1 million tonnes forecast earlier, according SADC says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia needs about USD 120 million to bring in the staple. Some donor countries have already contributed toward this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country is currently importing the maize from South Africa and Tanzania, using mainly private importers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new SADC estimates follow a revision of South Africa's own maize stocks. SADC had originally thought South Africa needed to import some 3 million tonnes but later discovered the country needs only 532,000 tonnes to bridge its shortfall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WINDHOEK, Nambia - The second conference of &quot;sister&quot; parties in Southern Africa, ended in the Namibian capital Tuesday with a communique urging more respect for former heads of state and other political leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The call was prompted by reports from the United National Independence Party of former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda to the conference hosted by Namibia's ruling SWAPO.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNIP delegation said Zambia's Movement for Multiparty Democracy government was persecuting Kaunda and had created a level of political tension that could plunge Zambia into political chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a report titled &quot;The Political Situation in Zambia Since the Last Presidential and General Elections in 1991&quot;, UNIP Secretary General Sebastian Zulu charged Zambia was likely to face political instability whose effects could spill over its borders, if the MMD government continued its persecution of Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zulu said labelling Kaunda a Malawian and threatening him with deportation did not augur well for peace in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said civil strife in Zambia could affect the entire southern African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP was the only opposition party invited to the three-day conference.  The conference agenda included political cooperation among countries in the region, unemployment and demobilisation of combatants of the liberation wars, and cultural and economic cooperation among political parties in southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parties represented at the conference included the 'Chama Chamapinduzi' of Tanzania, the MPLA of Angola, the BDP of Botswana, the BCP of Lesotho and Malawi's UDF.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Panafrican News Agency<BR>December 12, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The Press Association of Zambia (PAZA) has described as &quot;serious&quot; reports by the controversial Post newspaper that President Frederick Chiluba was born in Zaire while recent investigations carried out by a group of Zambian journalists revealed that he was born in Kitwe's Wusakile township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The issue is serious. PAZA will meet soon to make its stand known over the matter and a statement will be issued soon after the executive meets,&quot; said PAZA vice president Mike Daka.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post recently reported Chiluba had been born at Chibambo mission in Zaire of Zairean parents and that claims that he had been born in Kitwe on the Zambian Copperbelt were false. The Post published a copy of what it said was Chiluba's birth certificate. The document showed he had been born at Chibambo mission in Zaire of Zairean parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue is of importance as Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy has proposed constitutional reforms that would bar first generation nationals from contesting Zambia's presidential elections. The proposal had been widely seen as an attempt to bar former president Kennneth Kaunda, whose parents came from Malawi, from standing in the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A group of Zambian journalists last week visited Chibambo mission hospital in Zaire where the authorities refuted Post newspaper reports that Chiluba had been born there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zairean authorities said Chiluba could not have been born at the mission hospital because it had been built in 1944 while the president was born in 1943.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They named a Lusato Bondo as the person who had forged the birth certificate used by the Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same group of journalists visited Musangu village in Zambia northern Luapula province where a senior headman gave an account of Chiluba's life. He said the Zambian president was born in Wusakile in Kitwe but grew up in the village before going back to the Copperbelt to find work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The press assistant to the president, Richard Sakala, said the Post story was a fabrication designed by members of the opposition to discredit Chiluba.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda - People with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-2) can survive with it for 20 years without developing AIDS, researches say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A study conducted on prostitutes in the Senegalese capital, Dakar, showed that only one of the infected women developed the disease after nine years (1985-95), AIDS expert Phyllis Kanki said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kanki, of the Harvard Aids Institute in Boston, United States, participated in the study. She was addressing the Ninth International Conference on AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Africa, taking place in Kampala, Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said that HIV-2 provided natural protection against HIV-1. The latter is commonly found in east and Southern Africa countries. Scientists say it is 50 per cent different from HIV-2 mainly found in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the study, the World Health Organisation Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Ebrahim Samba said: &quot;If one can survive with the virus for 20 years without developing AIDS, this will give us enough time to find a vaccine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said, as the AIDS epidemic progressed, many people with the virus would recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the trend and history of epidemics. They rarely wipe out a generation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kanki, told PANA that some studies showed that people with HIV-2 survived for an average of between six and seven before developing AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another descovery in HIV-2 infected persons is that the possibility of mothers passing the virus to their babies during birth is minimal. In most cases, there is no transmission to the new born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Kanki said that the ratio of infection by mothers who are hIV-1 positive to new born babies is about one in three.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Shrugging off threats of an oil embargo, Nigeria increased crude oil production in November 1995 to 2.02 million barrels per day (MBD), according to data released by the National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supplies to the market, however, remained at the 1.865 (MBD) level allocated to the country by the 12-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting countries (OPEC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statistics from the NNPC which oversees production and marketing of the country's oil, show that output for November was higher than the 1.970 MBD produced in October.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But petroleum ministry officials say crude oil supply to the international market was still restricted to the OPEC quota despite rising production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statistics also show that crude oil production had been on the upward trend in the last five months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In July, output was 1.820 MBD, rising to 1.900 MBD in August and 1.950 MBD in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials link the performance to the resolution last August of a cash-call problem between the government and its joint venture partners, especially Shell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, the seventh highest oil-producing nation in the world had been facing threats of an oil embargo due the lack of progress by its current military administration in returning the country to democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation came to a head with the execution last month of nine minority rights activists, including the author Ken Saro-Wiwa, who in his life time campaigned bitterly against government and oil companies operating in Ogoniland, his native home, for the lack of development and the environmental degradation of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria like other members of OPEC has contributed to the current rise in the organisation's production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OPEC production rose to 25.67 MBD last month, more than one million barrels per day over its ceiling of 24.52 MBD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the relatively low oil price on the market and forecasts of higher production by competitors, the vienna-based body agreed last month to maintain its 24.52 MBD ceiling for the first six months of 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - The South African hotel industry is heading for an all-time record year in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Figures released Monday by the Central Statistical Service show that hotel bookings for the first nine months of this year exceeded 10-million bed-nights, about one-third above bookings for the first three-quarters of 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Europe remains the main source of visitors to South Africa with more than 50 percent of the total number of visitors up to the end of September 1995. Africa is the next highest source, with 17 per cent, followed by the Far East with 15 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Johannesburg Star newspaper reports that it is against this background that the giant Hyatt International group decided to move into South Africa with a 50-million-dollar hotel in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in neighbouring Sandton, the Hilton International group is busy constructing 60-million-dollar hotel, and Stocks Hotels and Resorts will be opening its 40 million dollars hotel in May 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, multi-million-dollar projects are being planned for more hotels in the cities of Cape Town and Durban, and in the scenic Mpumalanga province.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Ghana-based Ashanti Goldfields, has made a formal bid for the Parent company of Cluff Resources Zimbabwe Ltd, based in the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bid for Cluff Resources PLC by Ashanti, announced at the end of last week, comes in the wake of increased investor interest in the company, which has lucrative mining interests in Zimbabwe, Ghana and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports of the offer lifted Cluff Resources Zimbabwe's share price during trading in minings on the local stock exchange on Friday, which ended the day at 160 cents (18 US cents).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cluff announced last month it had received an approach which could lead to an offer being made for the entire issued share capital of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the offer was made, the UK company had been consulting with its financial advisors, Samuel Montagu, and had warned shareholders not to expect any further announcement for several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Market analysts said on Monday the takeover of Cluff Resourcesl PLC would give Ashanti a firm foothold in Zimbabwe, where cluff's subsidiary owns the country's largest underground gold mine near Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cluff Resources Zimbabwe Ltd recently announced it had entered into a joint-venture with another local mining firm to develop a major gold field some 200 km north-east of Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also interested in another joint venture to explore for diamonds with Masasa Mines, the Zimbabwean subsidiary of Australia's Delta Gold NL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ashanti, in which the Ghanaian government and the international conglomerate Lonrho PLC are the main shareholders, this year said it wanted to open an office in Zimbabwe and spearhead its exploration programme in southern and eastern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company, located some 180 km north-west of Accra, was last year reported to have found gold reserves of over 17 million ounces, making it one of the world's richest mines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - About six million Nigerians are suffering from diabetes, according to a news release from the Diabetic Association of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disease currently affects 2.8 percent of the adult population above the age of 15.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting its findings from a survey conducted by Nigeria's national experts committee on non-communicable diseases, the association said ignorance and poor education about the disease are causing unnecessary suffering and premature death among thousands of Nigerians annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With proper education, as much as 80 percent of diabetic complications can be avoided,&quot; the association said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the experts late diagnosis or poor management of the condition after diagnosis can lead to complications including heart and kidney diseases, failed pregnancy, blindness and amputation of limbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diabetes is partially hereditary and partially caught through the adoption of certain lifestyles, especially excessive consumption of carbohydrates and sugar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 100 million people (the population of Nigeria) have diabetes in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This figure is expected to double by the year 2010 unless drastic measures are taken to alter the situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's national soccer team coach Dutchman Bonfrere Jo is having problems obtaining visas for his technical crew of three trainers and four home-based players for a scheduled training tour of Holland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jo selected a squad of 26 players -- 22 of them European-based pros -- who have been called to camp this week in Holland to prepare for the Africa Cup of Nations tournament to be held in South Africa in January 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Super Eagles technical adviser who was to leave for Holland Wednesday tonight has yet to obtain visas the seven players and crew to fly out to Holland.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Dutch embassy is reluctant to grant him visas apparently because of the European Union's sports sanctions imposed against Nigeria following last month's execution by the military regime of nine minority rights activists including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sports sanctions expressly forbid the issuance of visas to Europe-bound Nigerian teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jo told newsmen about an alternative training site should he fail to secure the visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is somewhere near Tel-Aviv, in Israel,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Politicizing sports is not good. It's bloody politics but we will go to a nice place&quot;, he said in anticipation of the rejection of the Eagles in Holland and the possible shifting of camp to Isreal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Israel has been critical of the international community for its hostility towards Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Israeli ambassador in Nigeria Gadi Golan has been very vocal about his country's position on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the last-minute hitches being encountered the Nigerian Football Association said wednesday it was continuing with preparations for the Africa Cup of Nations match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the government is expected to announce Monday whether or not Nigeria will participate in the tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Youth and Sports Minister Jim Nwobodo cited national pride, diplomatic implications and safety for the players as reasons why the Super Eagles may not go to South Africa to defend the cup they won in Tunisia last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If a 30,000-dollar-fine is all Nigeria would suffer in the event of a pull-out, we can afford it,&quot; a ministry official told PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from suspension from subsequent editions of the Africa Cup of Nations, a country that withdraws faces other sanctions to be decided by Caf, Africa's soccer governing body.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUJUMBURA, Burundi - The United Nations International Commission of Judicial Inquiry will investigate acts of violence in Burundi that began two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although its mandate has not been specified, the commission will investigate the massacre of over 50,000 civilians and other acts of violence that followed the death of Melchior Ndadaye, the first democratically elected president in Burundi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was assassinated in a coup attempt Oct. 21, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After talking with the Burundian government, the commision will make recommendations on legal, political or administrative measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission will also work to bring to trial the perpetrators of the violence in order to promote national reconciliation in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 70 soldiers suspected of taking part in the coup attempt and 4,500 people suspected of active participation in the 1993 massacres are currently detained at Bujumbura central prison awaiting trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, pointing to recent attacks, a UN spokesperson in Burundi said the commission is operating in a climate that does no facilitate its work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the North Mutanga area, where the commission is based, the spokesperson said that armed gangs who belong to the ethnic Hutu majority killed more than 50 people and wounded many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission, which arrived in Burundi on Oct. 28, said Wednesday that five of its members will soon leave Bujumbura, the capital, to consult with the New York headquarters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Director of Program Management at the WHO office for Africa Dr. Ayite D'Almedia said the situation in the Ivory Coast is far from that experienced in the Zairean town of Kikwit where over 200 people died from the virus in January-May this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He singled out the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association, popularly known as Zimrights, saying it thrived on division and was bent on creating chaos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When in the name of human rights zimrights becomes zimlooters, blatantly violating our zimlaws, is the zimgovernment expected to view such criminal behaviour with folded hands?&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He termed these groups &quot;gangster organizations&quot; and warned that they would be &quot;descended upon with the full force of the law&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said, &quot;Let zimrights, so called, therefore know that we have a formidable structure of zimprisons waiting for its zimlooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe made these remarks in reference to recent demonstrations against the accidental fatal shooting by police of two pedestrians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demonstrators became violent, burnt cars and looted property worth some two million Zimdollars (about 222,220 U.S. dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said crime levels in the country had become unacceptable and needed to be immediately addressed as people were now living in constant fear of becoming victims of robbers, tricksters and conmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A no-nonsense law and order president, Mugabe was among leading personalities in the recent international campaign to punish the Nigerian military regime for its execution in November of nine human rights activists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO, Mozambique - The Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) has issued an &quot;action alert&quot; on Mozambique, charging the United States Embassy there of threatening freedom of the press and of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mozambique news agency, AIM, said Monday Misa usually targets governments in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The institute's latest criticism refers to the embassy's ban on its officials from speaking to United States journalist Joseph Hanlon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once a long-time resident in Mozambique and a prominent writer on the country, Hanlon was refused permission to speak with staff members of the United States Agency for International Development when he visited in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIM reported that when asked, embassy Press Attache Adrienne O'Neal gave no reason for the ban. But Ambassador Dennis Jett confirmed it, the institute said in its alert dated Dec. 15, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hanlon is an unprofessional journalist whose reporting is totally and consistently biased,&quot; the institute quoted Jett as saying. &quot;It is a waste of time talking to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said Jett claimed that the embassy ban did not limit press freedom and that the U.S. government would not prevent journalists investigating their findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But if the government doesn't want to talk to you, you can't force it to. It is my choice to take up questions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But AIM said the U.S. Embassy remained an important source for American journalists on Mozambique's foreign relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hanlon lived in Mozambique in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He was the correspondent for the London-based Guardian newspaper and for the British Broadcasting Corporation, media that are usually associated with high levels of professionalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has written several widely-praised books on Mozambique. A man of the ideological left, Hanlon has made trenchant criticisms of U.S. policy toward southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has American citizenship but is permanently resident in Britain where he says he enjoys greater freedom.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - Foreigners in Zimbabwe will be allowed 100 percent ownership of industries in areas reserved for citizens because of lack of local entrepreneurship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe Investment Centre (ZIC) executive for Bulawayo, Nohlupheko Phiri, said local people have no financial resources or the technology required.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was responding to remarks by some industrialists that barring foreigners from 100 percent ownership in areas reserved for locals blocked speedy industrialization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have said where there is high-tech, huge financial responsibilities or special skills that our people do not have, then foreign investors can be allowed to go 100 percent,&quot; Phiri told the Zimbabwe Inter Africa News Agency, Ziana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As part of measures to promote black economic empowerment, the government last year reserved areas for local investors, in which foreign investors may only be allowed to take up to 25 percent of equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the areas reserved for domestic investors include manufacture and marketing of amarments, public water provision for domestic and industrial purposes, agriculture, forestry, transportation, retail and wholesale trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These are traditionally areas dominated by our people but there are certain things like investment in luxury coaches which need money. That's where our committee gives special concessions to foreigners,&quot; Phiri said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he said special concessions could not be extended to manufacturing and marketing of amarments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early this year ZIC said it would continuously review conditions concerning investment by foreign companies in the reserved areas so as to speed up foreign investment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South Africa needs to double its economic growth rate in order to achieve its development targets, Prime Minister Thabo Mbeki has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's expected economic growth rate of 3 percent for 1995 was positive but the country needs 6 percent growth in the future, he said over the weekend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a year-end news briefing here, Mbeki said there were positive signs for the country's economy, which include a drop in inflation to 6.3 percent, the lowest in 23 years, and a reasonably large inflow of foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a vote for confidence in the future of the country, a vote by domestic investors and by international investors,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki emphasized the need for a sustained growth rate of at least six percent to keep economic growth on track. The key to this lay in manufacturing, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said growth has to be driven by new investment particularly in manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki said a clear policy on the restructuring of state assets should emerge in the new year, and a strategy for medium-term economic growth should be completed during the first quarter of 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Tuareg rebels in northern Niger are calling for an investigation into the death of Mano Daya, a faction leader who died in a plane crash Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebels said during the weekend they suspected Daya, head of the Tuareg 'Armed Resistance Coordination', had been a victim of foul play.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He died Friday around 1 p.m. local time when the chartered Cessna in which he was travelling exploded in the Tenere desert where his organization is headquartered. Witnesses said, however, the plane was flying in poor weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His second in command, the secretary general of the People's Liberation Army of Northen Niger and a French national were also killed in the explosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A professional tour operator, Dayak took up arms to fight for the autonomy of northern Niger in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of his aides, Rissa As Doula, in April signed a peace agreement with the government of Niger. Dayak refused to accept the truce and continued his armed rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is, however, widely believed he had entered into negotiations with the Niger prime minister, Hama Amadou, and French, Burkinabe and Algerian mediators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The negotiations, well placed sources said, were designed to map out a permanent peace accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government of Niger had by Saturday not reacted to the death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were in an airplane belonging to private airline, Niger Air Service. Witnesses said the plane exploded at noon local time (1 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time) soon after taking off from an airstrip in the Tenere desert, 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Agades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cause of the crash is still unknown. Witnesses said weather conditions were poor at the time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's military ruler Gen.Sani Abacha warned against what he called the &quot;re-balkanisation&quot; of Africa through regional groupings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a major foreign policy statement Saturday night in Abuja at the annual patrons dinner of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, Abacha said Africa should continue to resolve its problems through consensus and not confrontation. He apparently was referring to the Southern African Development Community's stand against his country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said everything must be done to stop &quot;the use of regional groupings to divide us&quot; because this will not do Africa any good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SADC member states, led by South African President Nelson Mandela, have been most vocal in their condemnation of Abacha for the execution last month of nine Ogoni minority-rights activists, including the celebrated writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States and the European Union countries imposed arms and sporting embargoes on Nigeria. The British-led Commonwealth suspended Nigeria, with the support of some African member countries, during the 53-nation body's recent summit in Auckland, New Zealand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha said Africa will continue to be the centerpiece of his country's foreign policy but stressed that with the apartheid's demise and in the light of the current situation, this policy would be revised, placing Nigeria's interest first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Commonwealth was unfair in its use of the Harare Declaration on good governence as a pretext to suspend Nigeria for what it claimed was the country's lack of progress in returning to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Harare Declaration did not lay down any timeframe for achieving democracy,&quot; Abacha said. Nigeria, he said, would remain faithful to its plan to return the country to civilian rule by 1998 but would not be stampeded into doing so by any country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, in his opening speech, NIIA Director General George Obiozor said his institution was satisfied with the government's conciliatory policy and rapproachment with certain sections of the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He appealed to the Nigerian leader to continue with his approach of &quot;charity to all and malice to none&quot; to ensure cordial relations between the country and the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nigeria needs the support of the international community in its efforts to achieve the goals of democratization and economic growth, just as the world needs Nigeria as a potential economic and political force in the continent of Africa,&quot; Obiozor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Founded on Dec. 13, 1961, as a nonprofit organization, the NIIA promotes the scientific study of international politics, economics and jurisprudence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its annual year-end patrons dinner has become recognized as an important forum for government to take stock of its international relations and make foreign policy pronouncements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), Kingsley Amoako, fears that because of the continent's archaic telecommunication network, it will not benefit from the emerging information super highways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is sad to note that many African countries still lack the required basic telecommunications facilities&quot;, he said recently at symposium organised as part of the second Biennial of Sciences and Technologies (AFRISTECH), held in Dakar from 11 to 16 December 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amoako said the communication growth gap between the North and the South is likely to widen when countries in the north intensify the use of &quot;Inforoads&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa, according to Amoako, gets into the 21st century with a precarious economic situation. Donors, Intergovermental and non-govermental organisations and the private sector must work together to enable Africa to have access and use the 'Inforoads', he told participants at the symposium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Momar Ali Ndiaye, who was chairing the symposium, said the Information Super Highways was &quot;one of the last chances Africa's endogenous development&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told PANA that Africa should not make the mistake of considering the use of of new information technologies as a luxury. It is rather a &quot;necessity&quot;, he stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to him, 80 percent of the World Economy will be accounted for by information sales. &quot;We have to create networks and organise ourselves so that others do not sell their information here,&quot; Ndiaye added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the 'Inforoads' have effects on all development sectors (Trade, Industry, Research...).Africa's chance lies on the adoption of an African Strategic Plan on<BR>that question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He named Egypt and South Africa as two African countries which were doing well by developing efficient communication systems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Mozambique is among few African countries which have won praise for their drive against sexually transmitted diseases as a way of curbing the spread of HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was said Tuesday here by the head of the country's Epidemiology department, Avertino Barreto, at a news conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Mozambique's experience in treating sexually-transmitted diseases was praised at last week's African conference on AIDS, in the Ugandan capital, Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Barreto said the worst AIDS- affected areas are Manica and Tete provinces, in central and northwestern Mozambique, where the number of aids carriers continues to rise as if no campaign was being implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that more work is being done to counter this rise. Mozambican health authorities estimate that nearly one million people already carry the Human Immunodeficiency Virus that leads to AIDS. Barreto said out of this number, only 2,000 AIDS patients have been registered by the health ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barreto said his department will step up its fight against sexually transmitted diseases, and the campaign will include sexual education in schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A study conducted recently in neighbouring tanzania says that there can be a 50 percent reduction in the rate of HIV infection if organised programmes of treating sexually-transmitted diseases are implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barreto lamented that cultural beliefs were making it difficult to change the mentalities of adults towards AIDS. He thus urged youth to raise to the challenge of saving future generations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe could soon displace Brazil as a major supplier of flue-cured tobacco to the Far East, Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) president Peter Richards said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richards said on a recent promotional trip to Asia and the Far East ZTA executives were told there was high demand for Zimbabwean flue-cured tobacco mainly because of its quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For the first time, some of the customers stated that they prefer our quality to that of Brazil. That is a promising development because for a long time Brazil has been supplying these countries,&quot; Richards said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I believe, therefore, that each and every country we visited will be taking increased quantities of our tobacco in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe is one of the world's top three tobacco producers together with Brazil and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richards said because of competition from other suppliers, Zimbabwean growers should cut costs and improve efficiency so as to remain competitive, particularly on prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I believe that if we do that we will have a better product to offer and if the product is not more expensive than our competitors', we have a great future in the region we<BR>visited,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richards said Zimbabwe's 1995/96 tobacco crop was looking good and nearly all the crop has been planted. Recent widespread rains, he said, had given hope tofarmers that they would have another record season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The start has been very favorable and growers' hopes are very high for an excellent crop, enough to satisfy our customers who are already making enquiries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Flue-cured tobacco production during 1995/96 was expected to rise from some 435 million pounds the previous season to about 462 million kg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tobacco, which brings in over Zimdollars 3.5 billion (389 million U.S.  dollars) annually, is one of Zimbabwe's single largest foreign currency earners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUANDA, Angola (PANA) - The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed that the two patients in the Ebanga area, in central Angola, were infected with the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The discovery of the two patients came barely two weeks after a Liberian refugee in Ivory Coast was confirmed to be infected with the Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The virus, which causes a severe haemorrhagic fever and bleeding that kills a patient within a week, caused 250 deaths in Zaire's Kikwit area between April and June 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The virus liquefies the patient's internal organs, provoking bleeding in several parts of the body, including the nose, mouth, eyes and skin, and excessive diarrhea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reporting the latest outbreak of Ebola in Africa, the Angolan News Agency, Angop, said last Friday that epidemiologists from the UN health agency arrived in Luanda the same day and travelled to Ebanga for further investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ebola spreads rapidly among people who touch an infected person's fluids, including blood and excreta. A doctor and nurses who operated on the first Ebola victim in Kikwit died of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, in Ivory Coast, medical experts from the French Medicins Sans Frontiers (Doctors Without Borders) discovered that only one of the four suspected Ebola carriers actually had the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The young Liberian refugee in Ivory Coast said he left behind another person with symptoms like his. This prompted health workers to travel inside the war-ravaged country to track other Ebola cases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - The incurable acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease is taking an increasing toll among youths in Africa, particularly young women, one of the workshops at the recently ended International Conference on AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Africa, was told. But the leading experts who participated in the workshop on the &quot;Status and Trends of HIV/AIDS Epidemics in Africa&quot; noted that while the pandemic continues to spread relentlessly on the continent, there is reason for hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop brought together 30 experts from a wide range of fields including epidemiology, economics, demography and international development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their conclusion was that different AIDS epidemics move through populations with different speed, taking an increasing toll on young people, especially young women. &quot;The HIV/AIDS epidemics in Africa have become the epidemics of the young,&quot; said Dr Daniel Tarantola of the Harvard School of Public Health, who co-chaired the workshop with Dr. Peter Lamptey of Ghana, the Director of AIDSCAP. Lamptey, one of the world's leading experts on HIV/AIDS,said that the apparent stabilization of HIV prevalence in some African countries could have resulted from the saturation of the disease in older age groups and the modification of sexual behaviour among young people due to ongoing prevention education efforts. &quot;The important point is that HIV prevalence is declining in some locations, whether or not we can explain exactly why,&quot; said Lamptey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World Health Organization figures show that by the end of 1994, over 11 million adults were living with HIV in Africa. This represented 65 percent of the total number of infections in<BR>the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although it has been predicted that Asia will overtake Africa in the number of new HIV infections in the coming decade, the major impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemics in Africa are yet to come, the workshop was told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The experts noted that 19 African countries had more than 100,000 people each currently living with HIV, which causes the incurable disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These countries accounted for 90 percent of all HIV infections on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Demographic surveys in several countries have shown substantial increases in infant and child mortality. Projections from Zambia and Zimbabwe indicate that AIDS will increase child mortality nearly threefold by 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Combined with the increase in adult mortality, these trends will result in significant reductions in life expectancy in countries hardest hit by HIV/AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is staggering is the fact that the pandemic is raging at a time when the African continent is also facing severe economic hardships, fewer employment opportunities, open conflicts, low-intensity wars, environmental degradation and natural disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These factors are causing the displacement or migration of millions of Africans from their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Away from their normal social settings, many of these severely stressed people become more likely to practice unsafe sex, thereby increasing the spread of HIV, the experts noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mobility, which facilitates the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, calls for enhanced surveillance as well as expanded HIV programs to address the specific needs of mobile populations, the experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout Africa the differences that have been seen between urban and rural HIV infection rates are narrowing, sometimes rapidly. No longer is HIV only mainly a threat to urban sexually active populations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sunday Times reported that the allegations surfaced<BR>after an investigation into the plight of eight Mozambican<BR>families of victims of a Vaal Reefs mines accident in May.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The investigating group including representatives from South<BR>Africa's Rand Mutual Assurance (RMA), National Union of Mine Workers<BR>(NUM), the Mine Labor Organization, Ernst and Young Auditors, and<BR>TEBA, an organization that handles compensation for miners from<BR>Botswana and Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seven months after the accident, the victims' widows have not<BR>seen any of the 60,000 rands (16,700 dollars) in insurance<BR>or life pensions of about 1,000 rands (278 dollars) a month, paid to<BR>families of the 96 victims of a similar accident in July, the<BR>paper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The investigation found that Rand Mutual Assurance was<BR>paying 700,000 rands (194,400 dollars) a month through the<BR>Johannesburg office of the Mozambican Department of Labor. Only<BR>about 10 percent of this is being paid out.<BR> NUM and the Chamber of Mines now are calling on the<BR>government to cancel a 1964 agreement with the then Portuguese<BR>colonial authorities that stipulates all Mozambican mine workers'<BR>compensation and death or disability pensions be paid through their<BR>country's labor department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investigators charged theft and corruption are the order<BR>of the day among those handling the money and that pensioners,<BR>many of whom are illiterate, are at the mercy of unscrupulous,<BR>unsympathetic officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NUM representative James Motlasi and executives from RMJA<BR>and TEBA told the Sunday Times they received a hostile<BR>reception from the Mozambican government in Maputo in November<BR>when they proposed that pension payments be handed over to<BR>TEBA, which administers similar payments for workers from<BR>Botswana and Lesotho.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba opened the conference Monday with a call to delegates to elect &quot;capable, honest and efficient leaders&quot; and a pledge to weed the party of corrupt leaders, but the party's vice president, Levy Mwanawasa, is challenging him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanawasa resigned as Chiluba's republican vice in 1994 after accusing Chiluba of lacking the courage to discipline corrupt cabinet ministers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analysts said Mwanawasa's resignation was likely to &quot;haunt&quot; him in Wednesday's elections. His political opponents accused the veteran lawyer of &quot;lacking courage&quot; himself by resigning from government when he was expected to help Chiluba cleanse government of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba launched an indirect anti-Mwanawasa campaign when he opened the convention by suggesting that the MMD could not hope to last long if it elected &quot;megalomaniacs whose love for power far exceeds dedication to the service of the people&quot;. This was an apparent reference to Mwanawasa's earlier departure from government.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD national chairman reinforced Chiluba's own bid by advising the 1,300 delegates to be wary about &quot;changing horses in mid-stream unless the other horse is lame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba's supporters have insinuated that Mwanawasa is mentally &quot;lame&quot; following a near fatal 1991 car accident while he was republican vice president. His bodyguard died in the mishap. He was treated at a South African hospital where doctors pronounced him physically and mentally able to continue as Zambia's vice president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Chiluba and Mwanawasa were founder-members of the MMD in 1991. The party initially comprised political rebels against former president Kenneth Kaunda's 17 years of one-party rule. They included academics, trade unionists and other groups disillusioned by Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD's early insiders, including Chiluba himself, confirmed that he was chosen to lead the party because he was considered the most likely candidate to defeat Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He eventually did beat Kaunda in the Oct. 31, 1991, multiparty general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanawasa is himself a professional lawyer and is credited with executing successfully most of the MMD's litigations in the legal campaign to get Kaunda to amend the one-party constitution to allow for multipartyism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba Monday sought to clear current doubts about his alleged alien nationality and threatened to ban the independent Post newspaper that he accused of orchestrating a malicious nationality campaign on behalf of Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda has said he will challenge Chiluba in the 1996 presidential elections despite the MMD recommendation in a new republican constitution that only people born in Zambia with Zambian-born parents should contest the top post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda had Malawian parents and Chiluba could himself be barred from the elections if charges that he was born in Zaire of Zairean parents were proved true.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin will lead the delegation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting broke out between Eritrean and Yemeni forces early Saturday and lasted two days, with Yemen accusing Eritrea of invading the islands with planes and naval ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Intermittent fighting continued until Tuesday, despite an announcement Sunday night in Yemen that presidents Issayas Afeworki of Eritrea and Abdella Ali Saleh of Yemen agreed to a ceasefire as of 9 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time Sunday, midnight local time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a statement issued here Wednesday by the Eritrean embassy, elements within Yemeni armed forces have made baseless charges against Eritrea concerning events in the Greater Hanish Islands since Saturday. &quot;This is apparently to instigate more trouble,&quot; the statement said. The statement said &quot;the mendacious accusations&quot; that the Yemenis were levelling against Eritrean armed forces are meant to make up for the failure of their military design over the islands belonging to Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Eritrean government said it took more than 180 Yemeni soldiers as prisoners and destroyed one helicopter. The announcement said six Eritrean soldiers were killed and three were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Organization of African Unity reiterated the comment made Monday by Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim that the row over the Hanish Islands should not be turned into an African-Arab dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This came after the League of Arab States backed Yemen in the dispute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Two fight-starved professional Zambian boxers decided they could no longer stand what they termed as persistent evasion by local title holders fearing to be dethroaned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, on Wednesday, they approached the northern Copperbelt Regional Police Commander, Henry Chisha, for a permit to hold street fights with the elusive champions. Chisha turned the request by Musonda Chinungu, alias The Bull, who seeks to challenge national light middleweight champion Chipundu Chipayeni, and of Masozi Kamanga, itching to snatch the light heavyweight title from Mike Chilambe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two sought police help in Ndola, the copperbelt capital, hoping that these would compel Zambian boxing officials to oblige the champions to stake the titles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accompanied by their fans and Chinungu's wife, Joyce Sabrina, the two marched into the police commander's office to ask for licences to fight the champions on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am a boxer and I feed my wife and children through fighting. That is why I and my friend... have come to ask for a permit to allow us to ' sort these guys' out in the streets and for the results of the street fights to count,&quot; Chinungu told the police chief at Ndola's Central Police post Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the request did not amuse Chisha in his capacity as the region's principal law and order enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That is an offense. We (police) do not give permission to commit an offence. How can we allow someone to fight in the streets,&quot; said Chisha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He warned Chinungu the police had &quot;enough empty cells&quot; for trouble-makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Undaunted by the warning, Chinungu said he would now approach Zambia's Boxing Board to allow the street fights. He said he cannot stand being evaded by Chipayeni who is allegedly &quot;scared&quot; of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a few further exchanges between the two men, Chinungu's wife took the police advice and persuaded her husband to drop the street fight idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two pugilists left the police station amid &quot;show of power&quot; by their fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia boxing fans have complained that professional boxing was almost dead since the departure of Nigerian Promoter Gibson Nwosu who had been instrumental in popularizing the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nwosu, who returned to Nigeria, was credited for grooming Lottie Mwale, Zambia's best known boxer and former Africa light heavyweight champion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe, - He is 80 years old and sitting on a wooden stool he takes a long pull from his pipe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He closes his eyes and slowly lets out the acrid smoke through his nostrils.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This will keep away the evil spirits for another day,&quot; says the old man offering me the pipe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I politely decline and he looks at me with a knowing eye and says, &quot;That is the problem with you children of today, you did not go through the proper channels of being brought up. You are too full of the white man's blood, that is why you are so weak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Why the government follows the white man's belief, I do not know.  Mbanje (marijuana) is a part of our life. I can spend the whole day telling you how it was productively used in the past. In our days children did not suffer from the silly illnesses haunting you today because we used mbanje as a protective herb,&quot; the old man says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our chiefs were wise then because they would clear their minds with the herb. Ask anyone who fought in the (Zimbabwe) liberation struggle how it helped them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marijuana, or mbanje as it is known in Zimbabwe in the local Shona vernacular, is readily avaliable throughout southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Zimbabwe, mbanje worth millions of dollars is confiscated by police annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditional herbalists believe marijuana has healing properties and can cure some cases of cancer, glaucoma, stress and many other illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Australian AIDS researcher, Don Baxter writes that the drug is actually more effective than most recommended drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It has long been known that marijuana is an effective treatment for some of the symptoms of cancer and glaucoma, the eye disease, and we would like to see the laws outlawing marijuana reformed for medical use,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The herb is said to have an advantage over pills as the smoke is transported all over the body through the lungs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One traditionalist says controlled legalizing of the drug should be an issue of high priority because it is the right of every African to live the African way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It should have long been decriminalized soon after independence because the laws banning cannibis were brought in by the colonialists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Before they came to Africa, mbanje was smoked in public by the elderly chiefs and kraal (village) heads but there wasn't any form of violence or aggressiveness,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the dangers of the herb are real with many people in Zimbabwe having been admitted to psychiatric homes suffering from mbanje-induced mental illnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With mbanje, a single pull causes permanent damage to the brain.  Therefore legalizing it would be leading people to death because once the brain is damaged, that would be the end of that person,&quot; said a Harare doctor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe's annual inflation soared to 26.3 percent in November largely due to a spate of food price hikes, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The rise in the general level of prices at this time of the year, while reflecting seasonal factors particularly on foodstuff items, was anticipated following increases in fuel prices, rates and electricity charges as well as sales tax and excise duties,&quot; the bank said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it said in a bulletin that indications were that inflation would start to fall during the first half of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foodstuff prices went up by 10.8 percentage points to 35.6 percent during November. Items registering major increases in this category were fruit and vegetables, bread, cereals, oils and fats as well as meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Also contributing to the annual rise in inflation in November was a 1.8 percentage point increase to 3.5 percent in prices of beverages and tobacco,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inflation is expected to end 1995 around the current level but should start to decline in the first half of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government and major donors financing market reforms launched five years ago expect inflation to reach 17 percent by mid-1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe's National AIDS Coordination Programme issued a chilling report Thursday on the spread of the deadly AIDS disease, saying estimates showed up to 25 percent of sexually active adults in the 15-49 age group could be infected with the HIV virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report said about 10 percent of Zimbabwe's population of some 10.4 million people were infected with HIV, while one in three babies who were born to HIV positive women had the virus which causes aids.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Almost all those with HIV are expected to develop AIDS in time,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It added that average life expectancy may be shortened by perhaps 20 years, with a shortage of young and middle-aged productive adults and huge numbers of orphans, possibly one in three of all children by the year 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sex ratios will change as women die younger than men, and dependency ratios will worsen. Alls sectors of society and of the economy will be affected,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Population growth is expected to slow and may become negative for a time, although it would gradually recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By mid-1995 Zimbabwe had a cumulative total of 40,000 AIDS cases reported but it was believed about two thirds of the cases went unreported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently country's health and child welfare minister shocked the nation with a report that up to 300 people were dying of AIDS-related diseases every week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tell said some 55,000 copies of its Christmas edition entitled &quot;Abiola's Freedom: The World Waits For Abacha,&quot; were seized Dec.17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The title refers to the detained millionaire-politician Moshood Abiola, who is the acclaimed winner of the annulled 1993 presidential election military regime.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said Thursday undereducated soldiers are partly responsible for the high number of military coups that plague the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pointing to the questionable way armies handle issues, Chiluba said that the majority of the military forces in Africa have been &quot;poorly regarded&quot; for many years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba was speaking at the opening of the Defense Services and Staff College, which will train senior defense services and command staff for the 12-member Southern Africa Development Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Zambia has trained officer cadets locally since independence in 1964 and it has relied on overseas courses to educate senior military personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said military coups in Africa are partly attributed to the lack of adequate education for the soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside influences have added to the mess, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The college, which has both army and air force wings, will admit defense personnel from SADC and offer 12-month courses to prepare officers for senior responsibilities in army command and staff appointments. Senior military delegations from several neighboring states, inluding Indian Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Kevin D'Souza, witnessed the inauguration ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gen. D'Souza said Wednesday that over the next three years India will contribute some $200,000 to the college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> India has trained many senior Zambian military personnel and was one of the leading supporters of the southern Africa liberation movements, including Nelson Mandela's Africa National Congress, that were based in Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - African newspaper editorials seemingly ignored the fighting between Eritrea and Yemen Saturday on the Hanish Islands, and instead gave attention to the just ended AIDS conference, Nigeria and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the AIDS meeting, Kampala newspapers appeared somewhat distressed by the fact that there was no announcement of a possible vaccine in sight against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even more depressing was the news that by the year 2000, as many as 40 million people will be infected with AIDS,&quot; the state-owned New Vision said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This paints a grim picture for Sub-Saharan Africa where the socio-economic disruption caused by the disease is beginning to bite hard,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite these grim revelations, it went on, the conferene was a success in that it was fully attended thereby emphasizing the &quot;global determination&quot; to combat the scourge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The conference also demonstrated the International faith in Uganda's open approach as the only credible way of dealing with the pandemic,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, the paper appealed to politicians and lawmakers, whose policies on protecting vulnerable groups like women are crucial, to take the lead in emphasising the multisectoral approach as the only way to limit the spread of AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the African peacekeeping force fanned out in Liberia Sud Quotidien, a privately-owned Dakar newspaper in Senegal, criticised other West African countries for not contributing more to the effort. The daily also offered reasons for this and the effect of this hands-off policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, it said, has greater influence in directing a solution in the Liberian crisis by defualt: That is because of the noncommital attitude by most of the 16 nations forming the Economic Community of West African States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, it said, following the decision to beef up ECOMOG, the peacekeeping force, &quot;again only Nigeria made a significant contribution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's dominance in Liberia illustrates the country's &quot;nuisance potential&quot; in the subregion, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is more so, it went on, because many countries have failed to condemn Nigeria's internal political policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> West African countries could not openly do so, it added, &quot;because that would expose them to similar criticism for their rule at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It noted that Nigeria, now under limited sanctions from the West and form South Africa, could easily use Liberia to &quot;thumb its noze&quot; at the international community: But it has not done so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a related issue, Organisation of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim also came under attack from the privately-owned Kampala Tri-weekly, The Star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ugandan paper took issue with Salim because of his statement that Nigeria should not be isolated for hanging Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others environmental rights activists in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is not clear what Salim ate, drank, or smoked during this meeting with the blood-drenched Nigerian Dictator-General Abacha in Abuja,&quot; It said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is profoundly puzzling why Salim chose to give comfort to a murderous military regime, at a time when popular opinion in Africa and the world over is demanding condemnation and isolation,&quot; it concluded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar - Newspaper editorials reaching PANA at the end of the year ignored one of the biggest stories recently, the fighting between Eritrea and Yemen over the Greater Hanish island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, one paper commented on another important and nagging problem: The fate of the multinational airline Air Afrique and another on the Isreal-Syrian peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Niamey-based Le Democrate noted the paltry state of finances in the multinational Air Afrique which, it claims, makes &quot;incessant demands&quot; for money. It said it did so in 1988, 1992 and 1995, each time asking for larger amounts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On each occasion the money was supposed to revamp the company on a long term but instead we are swamped by debt,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Every two years France and the member states are asked to give more, to artificially maintain the company, which is about to face stiff competition now that there is about to be total deregulation (of the aviation industry) in Europe,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But its (Air Afrique's) resources are very limited faced with Western megacompanies,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It put the blame for the airline's state on &quot;the blind attitude of those who, at the highest level, are charged with conducting our transport policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar's Sud Quotidien commented on the renewed optimism of peace since the resumption of exploratory talks between Israel and Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Senegalese paper warned that this was firmly &quot;set against the background of the intransigence&quot; of the radical Arab world and Isreal's overiding security concerns, especially over the Golan Heights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The peace accord between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel, it noted, started the peace process which has gained momentum with the assassination of Isreali Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said that Syria had re-entered the process, and was ready to make concessions to Isreal, at this time because it felt it had sufficient hold of Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it warned that achieving peace would not be easy for Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Damascus will be faced with the problem of the terrorist groups it harbours and which are violently opposed to Israeli-Palestinian accords,&quot; it said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If an agreement is reached these groups may become the snakes Syria will have reared in its own territory, just like extremist Israeli settlers who have become the enemies of peace from within,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Nigeria one Lagos newspaper focused on the effect of the country's 1995 budget. It noted the introduction of measures designed to redirect a troubled economy &quot;anchored on the philosophy of guarded deregulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objectives of the budget, it said, were also supposed &quot;to restore the dignity of the national currency (the naira), arrest spiral inflation, increase the money supply and attract foreign investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it said, 12 months after it budget &quot;turned out to be only a modest success against the goals set by the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, it noted that the &quot;inflationary rate has persisted, with escalating cost of basic necessities of life. The price mechanism has collapsed due to the inability of the government to induce private sector reduction of the cost of raw materials which has affected the cost of production.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The daily claimed &quot;this has led to down-sizing of the industries with attendant high rate of unemployment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, it went on, &quot;the standard of living in the country has plummeted considerably leaving Nigerians despondent and impoverised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation, it said, was made &quot;more disconcerting&quot; with the deplorable state of infrastructure and other related public utility services, &quot;thus creating a gloomy climate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worse still, it said, &quot;the hostile political atmosphere has undermined the laudable policy thrust of the budget by eroding the confidence of key players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to soccer, the privately owned Lagos newspaper The Punch paid tribute to George Weah, a Liberian, for winning the Golden Ball award of European football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Can anything come out of Liberia? Oh yes one good thing, at least has come out of war-torn Liberia. and that 'one good thing' is George 'Opong' Weah who, Monday became the European Footballer of the Year 1995,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weah's dexterity in scoring goals, his gentlemanly behaviour on and off the field, it said, were &quot;some of the qualities that must have endeared him to the judges&quot; who chose him for the two awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But perhaps more than these are Weah's outstanding contributions to the development of soccer in his war-ravaged homeland. Single-handedly, he has lifted the Liberian national team by the bootstraps, making all the financial contributions that have made it possible for the team to compete in international competitions,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It warms the heart to note that Weah's sacrifices and contributions, not only to the Liberian national team but also to African football have not gone unnoticed,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Weah has done himself proud, he has brought hope to the land of his birth and prestige and honour to every black man,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nouakchott, Mauritania - After their first appearance in the African Cup of Nations, two years ago in Tunisia, the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone are itching for a tougher fight at the tournament to be held January 1996 in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sierra Leoneans have proved they have sharp claws in the paws by twice winning, successively, the zone two tournament of the Supreme Council for Sports in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alternatively known as the Amilcar Cabral Cup, the zone two tournament was held November 17-18 in the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This triumph after a home victory in 1993, is evidence of the country's soccer progress. It emerged from this competition as the only nation in the zone to qualify for the African cup finals. Seven-time Cabral Cup winner Senegal was sidelined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sierra Leone did not lose a single game in the Cabral'95, winning five of their six matches without most of their professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Bloemfontein, South Africa, the Leone Stars will face Zambia, runners up in the 1994 Africa cup, Algeria, 1990 champions, and Burkina Faso, all in group B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under Swedish Head Coach Roger Pamgren, who took charge of the team in July, and Abdoulaye Garincha Cesseay, the Leone Stars started training in November. They played friendly matches in Accra and Libreville, losing 2-0 against Ghana's Black Stars and 1-0 against Gabon's Azingo National.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second phase of preparations December, which includes 14 European based professionals, takes on teams in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the more well known professionals are Mohamed Kanu, who plays for the first division Belgian side Alost, Mohamed Sylla of first division Belgian side Lokeren, and Mohamed Kaloum with first division Inter Milan of Italy.  Others are Moussa Kaluga who plays in Portugal, Lamine Konte in Germany), John Lama, Abou Kanu and Biche Bangoura who all play in Sweden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sierra Leone will meet Ghana and Gabon again but this time in Freetown before spending a week in Gambia where they will play the Scorpions in Banjul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Friendly matches are also scheduled against Senegal and Mali before a final training camp in Sweden.  &quot;The December matches will allow us to spruce up tactical play in the team, which is undergoing some changes,&quot; Pamgren said. &quot;I have noticed improvement in defence as well as in attack. Our passing is better now.&quot; The task ahead, he said, was to ensure that the mixture of locals and foreign based professionals worked well together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team is more mature, our players want to make an impact in South Africa,&quot; team Captain Bah Ibrahimah said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar - Nigeria's Super Eagles will be the main attraction in Durban, South Africa, where teams in Group C of the 20th African Cup of Nations will battle to reach the finals and capture the trophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria comes with vast experience, having reached the final four times in the last six competitions. The Super Eagles' best performance was in 1994 in Tunisia, where they won the African trophy fielding an array of talented professionals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian line-up will be a bit different in South Africa '96, especially in defence: long-serving Captain Stephen Keshi has retired. But the best Nigerian forwards -- Daniel Amokachi, Emmanuel Amunike, George Finidi and Austin Okocha -- are still very much on the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only uncertainty it the participation of goal poacher Rashidi Yekini, who finished top scorer in Senegal '92 and Tunisia 94. He has been benched for several months because of injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At any rate, Super Eagles Dutch coach Jo Bonfrere is not too worried. He has a reservoir of quality players from which to draw: his newest asset, forward Nwankwo Kanu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barely aged 20 years, Kanu won the European Champions League 1995 with fellow Nigerian Finidi, both playing for Dutch team Ajax of Amsterdam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia also has a highly rated squad although this will be its first participation in African Cup finals. In wartorn Liberia, football remains one of the few unifying factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Geroge Weah, who symbolises that unity in the team, is rated Africa's best player. He and teammates Joe Nagbe, James Debbah, Christopher Wreh or Mass Sarr, all play in Europe. They are aware of the importance of football in their country and worked hard to qualify the Lone Star for South Africa '96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, after qualification, Liberia now has to prove its metal in the finals despite the team's inexperience and weak defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gabon, coached by Alain Da Costa, is hoping to better its performance in Tunisia when, under Belgian coach Jean Thissen, it was booted out in the first round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Tunisia proved a worthwhile experience for Azingo National, as the Gabonese team is known. Since November the team with professionals such as Pierre Yaya Aubame and Guy Roger Nzamba have beeen training together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And there is Zaire, which has called up 13 professionals in an effort to recover its past soccer crown. In South Africa, the Leopards, as the Zairean team is called, will be directed by Turkish coach Mushi Ertugal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire started its preparation very early and if players like Dinga Mbote and Lembi Lukaku are at their peak for their third consecutive participation, they will be a force to be reckoned with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Group C teams and their records in the African Cup:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Gabon: One participation in 1994. Eliminated in round one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Liberia: First participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Nigeria: Ten participations. Champions in 1980 and 1994. Runners-up in 1984, 1988 and 1990; Third in 1976, 1978 and 1992. Eliminated in the second round in 1963 and 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Zaire: Nine participations. Champions in 1968 and 1974. Fourth in 1972. Quarter-finalists in 1992 and 1994. First round elimination in 1965, 1970, 1976 and 1988.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kinshasa - The First vice-chairman of the Zairean Football Association, Mvumbi Puati, has decided to leave office temporarily for personal reasons, sources said in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision is said to have resulted from differences between FEZAFA members following a long crisis of legitimacy, the sources added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It took the intervention of the International Federation of Association Football, FIFA, to restore order in the association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, UNIBRA, a brewery in the Zairean capital, has offered 11,000 U.

The money will go to paying bonuses to the players in the 20 African Cup of Nations which kicks off January 13 in South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar - The South African national football team, Bafana Bafana, remain an enigma in the ratings for the 20th African Cup of Nations which kicks off January 13 in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few African sports analysts have been able to watch the Bafana Bafana.  This is because South Africa was banned from continental and international competitions for two decades because of its policy of separate development for all races, also called apartheid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, just three years after the sports ban with South Africa was lifted it organised and won the May 25 to June 24 Rugby World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, with less than three weeks before the 20th Africa Cup, the question asked by many observers is whether the South African footballers can equal the feat of the country's rugby players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's Orlando Pirates, winners of the 31st African Champions' Cup on December 16 in Abidjan, have given a first hint of things to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Orlando's victory is significant since it marks South Africa's first triumph in continental soccer. It is also a warning to other teams facing the Bafana Bafana in the 20th African Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite playing away and before a capacity crowd of 50,000 ASEC supporters in Abidjan's Houphouet Boigny stadium, Orlando's Sea Robbers staged a real &quot;hold up&quot; by winning 1-0 against the odds on favourites. Two weeks earlier they held ASEC 2-2 in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bafana Bafana are aiming to use this club's triumph as a springboard to continental glory come January.  Their opponents in Group 'A' - Cameroon, Egypt and Angola are warned: The South Africans are tough competitors and with home support can be formidable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pirates' victory in Abidjan follows a series of good results by the South African national team, which also won a the four-nation tournament November in Johannesburg against Cameroon, Egypt and Zambia.  Following Orlando's African triumph, President Nelson Mandela said the team had given South African football the perfect platform on which to build to ensure victory in the African Cup tourney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another encouraging development, South Africa held treble world champions Germany to a goalless draw on December 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bar of competition is set high, but that is unlikely to deter the Bafana Bafana from trying to clear this obstacle, just as the Springboks did in June against all expectations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar - DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Algeria, South Africa and Tunisia, three countries competing in the 20th African Cup of Nations, have triumphed at the club level by winning the three continental club competitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These victories should be a warning to their opponents in groups 'A', 'B' and 'D', since they are a sign of the three countries' potential to perform well in the African Cup which will be held from January 13 to February 3, 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Football punters will have to take into account the results of the three African club competitions in making bets for the big event. Players who won an African trophy at club level will be morally and physically ready to lead their national teams to glory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the players of Orlando Pirates, 1995 African club champions, South Africa have a reservoir of quality footballers capable of winning matches for the 'Bafana Bafana'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Likewise, Algeria can draw from Jeunesse Sportive Kabilye, winners of the 21st African Cup Winners' Cup, and Tunisia should build their team around Etoile Sportive Sahel, winners of the 4th Confederation of Africa Football Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the African Cup of Nations can be a different competition altogether, where nothing can be definitely decided on in advance. Victory in club competitions does not always rub off on the national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, countries whose clubs win African trophies do not always perform well in the African Cup. Such is the case of Egypt, whose clubs, especially Al Ahly and Zamalek, dominated African football in the 1980s. They won the African Cup of Nations at home only in 1986, after a long drought. It could take more than club success to win the 1996 African Cup of Nations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Panafrican News Agency<BR>December 20, 1995<BR>by Randy Zormelo, PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - The diplomatic row between Nigeria and the international community over the execution last month of nine Ogoni minority rights activists, including the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, brought fears of a boycott by Nigeria of the Africa Cup of Nations tournament to be played in South Africa from January 13 to February 3, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The execution triggered the suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth and calls for sanctions against the West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That South Africa and the European Union (EU) countries fired the first shots did not go down well with the military authorities in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The EU sports boycott of Nigeria, the spear-heading by South African president Nelson Mandela of an international isolation of Nigeria, and the withdrawal by South Africa of Nigeria's invitation to a four-nation friendly international soccer competition were interpreted in Lagos as acts of hostility which should be met squarely by boycotting the nations cup.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opinion was, however, divided on this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While some argued that a boycott would damage Nigeria's prestige as a sporting nation in Africa and the world, others believed it would hurt the EU countries and South Africa, who have invested in the event and stand to gain financially from it, more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even FIFA's warning later to South Africa that it was opposed to Nigeria being barred, for political reasons, from the four-nation friendly competition it (South Africa) organised ahead of the cup finals failed to cool down tempers in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, it did little to quel the controversy as to whether or not the Super Eagles should keep the appointment in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government's muted reaction to the issue, in spite promises of an official statement, heightened fears of a possible boycott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If a 30,000 dollar fine is all Nigeria would suffer in the event of a pull out, we can afford it,&quot; an irritated youth and sports ministry official told PANA. But he forgot the proviso that apart from suspension from subsequent editions of the African Cup of Nations, a country that withdraws from the competition faces other sanctions from the Confederation of African Football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A withdrawal 20 days to the start of the competition would earn the defaulting country suspension from two subsequent editions. In an effort to beat this deadline, the go-ahead finally given the Super Eagles by military the government on Friday to defend the cup they won in Tunisia in 1994 came as a relief to many sports lovers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the decision by Nigeria to attend the soccer fiesta was loaded with conditions, including the issuance of visas to its players, officials and supporters by the South African embassy in Lagos and a guarantee by the South African Football Association (SAFA) of their safety and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the political problems that nearly marred the competition, security inside South Africa became a factor following recent incidents in which players and supporters of ASEC Mimosa of Cote d'Ivoire were manhandled and a robbery after the shooting dead of a cashier at the venue of a world boxing title fight in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Safa's quick move to reassure Nigeria that all the conditions would be met soothed the nerves of soccer its lovers.  Sports minister Jim Nwobodo in breaking the news of Nigeria's participation after a marathon meeting, said he had received a letter from SAFA secretary general, Donald Norman, that &quot;all would be well with the Super Eagles&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Nations Cup is an African affair. We have no choice as Africans but to join our brothers at the championship,&quot; said an apparently appeased Nwobodo.  But the saga surrounding the participation of Nigeria in the competition continues and could have a traumatic effect on its team, especially since the sporting sanctions imposed on the country have begun to bite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its squad of 26 players, of whom 22 are European-based professionals called to camp last week, could not assemble because Dutch coach Bonfrere Jo failed to obtain visas for his technical crew of three and four local-based players to fly out of the country to Holland where the team was to set camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, Jo was denied visas by the Israeli embassy in Lagos to enable him prepare the squad in Tel Aviv, the alternative site selected by the Nigerian soccer officials. With his plans in complete disarray, Jo is now setting his eyes on Morocco, Ethiopia or Kenya as possible camp sites -- about 25 days to the tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Eagles' state of preparedness will now depend not only on their physical fitness and cohesion but also on their ability to psychologically overcome the trauma of sporting sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan From the West African's political capital, the group, of mainly locally-based soccer stars, will travel to either Italy or France where they are expected to blend their tactics with European-based professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN, Cote D'Ivoire (PANA) - The Ivorian national football team, known as the 'Elephants', Monday ended an initial two-week training stint in Yamoussoukro, to prepare for the 20th African Cup of Nations finals in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team's handlers said six professionals are to join the final training phase. These are France-based Tiehi Joel (Martigues) and Moussa Traore (Ales), who have been called up by the national coach, Frenchman Pierre Plemelding.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the team will greatly miss hit-man Ahmed Ouattara, another professional who plays for Sporting Lisbon in Portugal. He has been medically declared unfit for four months following a recent injury in a league match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cote D'Ivoire, who have been drawn in Group 'D', will play in Port Elizabeth against Ghana, Mozambique and Tunisia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 'Elephants' started their training camp on December 6 in Yamoussoukro with a group of local players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were Hoba Guy, Traore Zacharie, Hobou Arsene, Genito Kpassagnon, Lue Ruffin, Kone Ibrahima, Kone Adama Clofie, Gouamene Maxime, Die Serge (Africa Sports), Kamara Ibrahim, Tizie Jean-Jacques, Loue Guy Claude, Zeze Tape (Stade d'Abidjan), Tidiane Youssouf, Obou Macaire, Bile Serges (Stella Abidjan), Dadie Hyacinthe, Grobli Mihel, Tiene Aboubacr and Seri Ambroise (SOA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one of the team's test matches, the home-based boys won the international peace tournament 'Belier D'Afrique', staged from November 26 to December 2 in Libreville, Gabon, in the memory of the late president Felix Houphouet Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire, who died two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In that competition's final match, the Ivorians beat Algeria 2-1.The other teams were Cameroon which came third while hosts Gabon held the tail.  All the four teams have qualified for the Cup of Nations final in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their second outing, December 9, the 'Elephants' beat visiting Mali 2-1 in the central town of Bouake.  In the final residential training in Europe, the Ivorian side will be reinforced with players from African vice-champions, ASEC of Abidjan. The team lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates on a 3-2 goal aggregate in the final of the 31st African Champions' Cup on December 6.  The Ivorians have an impressive participation record in the African Cup of Nations, which is held every two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African '96 will be 12th involvement of the 'Elephants' in the prestigious continental cup's finals (1965, 1968, 1970, 1974, 1980, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994 and 1996).  After failing to win the trophy at home in 1984, the Ivorian side finally won the 18th edition in 1992 when it was hosted by Senegal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar - Cote d'Ivoire's Laurent Pokou still holds the record for the largest number of goals scored in the African Cup of Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The famous Ivorian striker scored 14 goals in two editions -- six in 1968 in Ethiopia and eight in 1970 in Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is followed by Nigerian Rashidi Yekini with 13 goals. Yekini finished top scorer in the last two editions with four goals in Senegal (1992) and five in Tunisia (1994), where he missed a number of chances which, if converted, would have allowed him to beat Pokou's record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yekini had scored once in 1988 and three times in 1990. The Nigerian centre forward, who sustained a serious knee injury and has been sidelined for a long time, could have another opportunity to beat Pokou's goal tally if he is included in the 'Super Eagles'' line up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third all-time top scorer in the African Cup is Egyptian Hassan Chazli with 12 goals in three editions -- six in 1963, five in 1970 and one in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only one of the leading scorers in the African competition is certain to play in South Africa: Ivorian Abdoulay Traore, alias Ben Badi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the top scorer for a single edition of the African cup is Zaire's Ndaye Mulamba, who netted nine goals in 1974 in Egypt. Egypt's Diab Mohamed El-Attar remains the top goal scorer in one match. He netted all four goals in the final of the first edition which Egypt won 4-0 against Ethiopia.  The 20th Africa Cup of Nations championships open in South Africa net month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar - Morocco's national football team, the Atlas Lions, will be among the giants missing in the 20th African Cup of Nations which kicks off next January in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morocco's international record shows one African Cup victory in 1976 in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and three participations in the World Cup finals -- in 1970 and 1986 (Mexico) and in 1994 (United States).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Atlas Lions failed to qualify for South Africa '96, losing the qualifying spots of group 7 to Burkina Faso's 'Stallions' and Cote D'Ivoire's 'Elephants'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burkina Faso won the group's top slot, against all odds, as the Ivorians and Moroccans were hot favourites to qualify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a tally of three points, Morocco finished third, behind Burkina Faso (7 points) and Cote D'Ivoire (4 points).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Moroccans saw their African dream wrecked by the Stallions, who beat them 2-1 in Burkina Faso and drew against them in Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morocco then beat Cote D'Ivoire 1-0 in Casablanca and lost to the same team 0-2 in Abidjan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other former African champions who failed to clinch a ticket for South Africa '96 are Ethiopia, 1962 winners in Addis Ababa; Sudan, 1970 winners in Khartoum; and Congo, 1972 winners in Yaounde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it was not a surprise that these three teams failed to make it because they are no longer the football giants they used to be on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The elimination of Senegal, Guinea and Mali, participants in the 19th edition in Tunisia, was also an upset for some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three Zone II countries peformed rather well in the 1994 edition.  But Sierra Leone will be the Zone's only representatives in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supporters of Senegal's 'Lions', Mali's 'Eagles', and Guinea's 'Sily' will now have to watch other teams for thrills.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar - Twenty-eight African national soccer teams will have played in the African Nations Cup at least once by the time the 20th tournament ends in South Africa February 3, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt, with 15 appearances, has the highest showing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the best attendance index goes to Cote d'Ivoire. This is because it has made the most appearances without interruption. From 1984 to 1994, Cote D'Ivoire has participated in 12 straight tournaments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cote d'Ivoire's achievement is noteworthy since, unlike Egypt which first took part in the competition in 1957, the Ivorian Elephants appeared in CAN for their first time in 1965.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beside Egypt and Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria are the next most regular attendants in the cup finals. If their outing in South Africa is figured in, they will have each attended 12 tournaments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But whereas some 20 countries have yet to make their fist attendance at the soccer festival, 12 others have managed this just once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is true for Mauritius which appeared in 1974, Tanzania (1980), Libya (1982), Malawi (1984). In South Africa, Angola and Liberia will be competing in the tournament for the first time.  Egypt remains the only country which, so far, has refused to play in the competitions after qualifying. Citing political reasons, the Pharaohs stayed away in Libyan '92.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The best performance-attendance ratio is held by Libya. It is the only team which has reached the final in its only showing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mali also gets credit for notable performances. It lost 3-2 to Congo in the 1972 final and reached the 1994 Tunis<BR>semi-final albeit ending in a 4-0 drubbing by Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that this training stint was of utmost importance to the team because it would be first by all the players together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pleimelding said that the Elephants will play five friendlies in Mouries against a selection of National 1 (the French Premier League) players on December 23, Martigues on December 26, a Monaco team on December 30, a First Division selection on January 3 and the Montpellier team on January 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before leaving for France, the players received 200,000 francs cfa (about 417 U.S. dollars) each as part of their 500,000 franc (1,042 dollar) allowance. The balance will be given to them in Marseille.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team will return to Abidjan January 8 and board a special flight, the same day, for Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kinshasa - Zaire's national football coach, Mushin Ertugal, has called up eleven professionals to join the team currently preparing for the finals of the African Cup of Nations, kicking off in South Africa January 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eleven professionals, including Mukanya (Lomel, Belgium), Essende (Durban, South Africa), Ndinga Mbote (Guimaraes, Portugal), Bunene (Turkey), Lembi (Brugge, Belgium) and Lukaku (Seraing, Belgium), have been asked to join the team in Kinshasa by the end of December.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, while the form of players such as Mukanya, Ndinga Mbote, Lembi and Lukaku, who represented Zaire in Tunisia '94 is known, the fitness of several others is doubtful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Locally-based national team players are undergoing two training sessions per day at Kinshasa's Kamanyola Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a test match on December 2, the Leopards were held to a 2-2 draw by Etoile Club of Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result discouraged Kinshasa soccer fans who had expected foreworks from the team, which had just returned from training stints in Germany and Turkey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar - Enigmatic goalscorer Abdoulaye Traore, alias 'Ben Badi', will be among Cote D'Ivoire's major assets in the 20th African Nations Cup which kicks off on 13 January in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aged 29, Traore will play in the African Cup for the 6th time and will be among the most experienced players in South Africa '96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ben Badi has a knack for scoring goals, and decisive ones at that. The Ivorian centre forward, who has been a regular of the African Cup since Egypt '86, is currently fourth in the competition's scoring chart with nine goals, behind fellow Ivorian Laurent Pokou (14), Nigerian Rashidi Yekini (13) and Egyptian Hassan Cahzli (12).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1986, he scored the only goal in Cote D'Ivoire's 1-0 win over Senegal, one of the favourites, and opened the door to the semi-finals for the Elephants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, he has been netting goals in the African Cup with a regularity which does not match the pattern of his footballing career, which could have been far more successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traore, whose build and goal poaching ability are reminiscent of Germany's Gerd Muller, who terrorised defenders in the 1970s, did not have the career observers deemed suitable for his talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His critics blame this on a lack of ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ben Badi says he was penalised by incompetent coaches and managers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever the case, Abdoulaye Traore has so far failed to win his place in professional football despite being among Africa's top goalscorers in the last few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1974, he left Stella Club of Abidjan for ASEC, the most popular team in the Ivorian economic capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this was only the beginning in the Traore saga. When called up for the national team, he deserted a training camp in Yamoussoukro in 1985. This caused an outcry among football fans.  He then left for FC Metz in the French first division, when he was only 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Traore could not adjust to the harsh Lorraine winter. He is good at scoring goals in almost any position, but he does not like to suffer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This latter side of his character was a liability in professional football, and his short stay in Portugal, after France, was also a failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990, he eventually decided to return home to ASEC. The club had then been in the shadow of arch-rivals Africa Sports of Abidjan for 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But on his return, Ben Badi outclassed opponents to help ASEC to the national title. By so doing, he became the idol of ASEC's management and supporters alike, despite being somewhat inconsistent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ivorian football fans are hoping that Traore will have digested the disillusion of losing the African Champions' Cup to South Africa's Orlando Pirates when the 20th African Cup of Nations kicks off. Otherwise, it will be difficult for the Elephants to repeat their triumph of 1992 in Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the African Cup will be the best opportunity for Traore to show that his talent has remained undented and silence his critics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-million franc cfa cheque came from the country's post office and was handed to the chairman of the Burkina faso Football Association, Didier Ouedraogo, by Communication Minister Claude Somda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The post office was responding to an appeal by government to support the Stallions for the Nations Cup finals which begin January 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a related development, the post office said it would begin January 4 issuing stamps bearing the logo of South Africa '96. The stamps will also picture the Stallions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Defending champions, Nigeria, have pulled out of the 20th Africa Cup of Nations tournament kicking off January 13, 1996 in South Africa, because of security reasons, Sports Minister Jim Nwobodo announced in Lagos Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We regret that this decision which has been painfully taken as a last resort after exploring all possible ways to ensure the safety of our players and the prevalence of an atmoshpere of fairplay,&quot; he told a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister said reports by Nigerian Foreign Ministry had shown very serious security risks for Nigerian players in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian National team known as the Super Eagles was to have left Lagos Friday for Nairobi, Kenya for training ahead of the 16-nation soccer fiesta in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria and South Africa have been involved in a diplomatic row following the November 10 executions of nine Ogoni activists, among them the author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The execution of the nine, convicted of murdering four of their kinsmen from southeastern Nigeria in 1994, has provoked international condemnations and sanctions against the West African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria recalled its envoy from Lagos and imposed arms embargo on Nigeria, because of the executions. President Nelson Mandela has vowed to intensify international efforts to isolate Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa also withdrew Nigeria's invitation to a recent four-nation soccer tournament, while Miss Nigeria was forced to withdraw from the Miss World Pageant in South Africa's Sun City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Announcing the withdrawal from the nations cup, Minister Nwobodo said &quot;we know that there are repercussions and even possible sanctions, but far more important is the safety of lives of our players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Nigeria would explain to the African Football Confederation, CAF, the constraints that compelled it to take this course of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Nwobodo &quot;there is no superior consideration than that of lives of our citizens particularly such great ambassadors as our players, officials and fans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that if a Nigerian player was seriously maimed or killed by violent action &quot;a terrible blemish would have been caused not only to CAF and the cup of nations but a further souring of relations between Nigeria and South Africa would be inescapable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These threats do not only concern the acceptable sporting disapproval signals of jeering and whistling but border seriously on life and death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister said Nigeria had requested written assurances from the South African Football Association, SAFA, but there had been no positive response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Eagles' Dutch coach, Jo Bonfrere told PANA he was &quot;disppointed&quot; by the withdraw news. &quot;There is confusion all over, but I am still hopeful if we receive the assurance we will travel to South Africa to defend the cup,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coach said all the 26 invited players, but three, who were to have joined the team in Kenya, were now in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Eagles' Skipper Austin Eguavoen was equally disappointed. He said the players had waited for two days for the minister's address, &quot;only to receive a sad news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he said the minister had been &quot;painstaking&quot; in explaining the situation to the players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; I am going to appeal to the players to take it easy and go back to their various clubs,&quot; Eguavoen said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Going by standing rules, Nigeria risks being barred from international soccer for the rest of the century following its decision Saturday to withdraw from the 20th Africa Nations Cup due to kick-off in South Africa in the next two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African champions took the decision citing fear for the safety of their players. This followed a diplomatic row between both countries after the November 10 executions for murder of nine Nigerian minority rights activists, including the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Article 14 (4) of the African Football Confederation (CAF) rules and regulations frowns at withdrawals from the confederation's competitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other sanctions, the rule says an offending country could forfeit affiliation fees, pay a hefty fine and risk suspension from subsequent editions of the championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Football analysts in Lagos say the implication of such sanctions is that Nigeria could be barred from the 1998 Africa Nations Cup. And if the measures are endorsed by the world's soccer governing body, FIFA, Nigeria could also be excluded from the preliminaries and finals of the 1998 world cup in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In reference to the grim scenerio, sports minister Jim Nwobodo, while announcing Nigeria's withdrawl from the Africa Nations Cup, said the country &quot;will dutifully explian to CAF the constraints that have compelled us to take this course of action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have still to be official reactions from CAF and F*IFA, which early this year, citing security reasons, withdrew Nigeria's hosting right for the world youth soccer tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, members of Nigeria's national team, the Super Eagles have continued to express disappointment over the country's withdrawal from the nations cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's 1993 footballer of the year, Rasidi Yekini said &quot;football is so important to us in the country and our lives are at stake too. But the competition is good for our career,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To prevent the country from missing the World Cup and other international competitions, Rasidi, who now plays in Spain, said Nigeria should contact CAF and FIFA to extract security guarantees for Nigerians from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Eagles could travel to South Africa under a 24-hour-notice to defend the trophy they won in 1994 in Tunisia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another Eagle, Victor Ikpeba of Liege Monaco, France, said he would &quot;hang around for another three days,&quot; to see if Nigeria would change its mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equally disppointed was Celestine Babayaro, who said &quot;it is unfortunate because I am appearing in the competition for the first time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Eagles' Dutch coach, Jo Bonfrere remained hopeful. He said he collected the contact addresses of the players, saying that &quot;a phone call or fax can make the difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports reaching PANA Sunday from Johannesburg said South African soccer officials had expressed shock and disappointment at Nigeria's decision to withdraw from the Cup of Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) quoted the president of the South African Football Association (SAFA), Solomon Morewa as saying &quot;we are surprised with the decision. We are utterly devastated. We have assured the nigeran officials and the team of security and we mean no harm to them whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said South Africa was well prepared to receive the Eagles, adding &quot;only on Friday last week we received a full list of the Nigerian contingent and we had since started processing visas for them. They should have told us then that they were not coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morewa was quoted as saying his country intended to seek CAF's intervention in the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Panafrican News Agency<BR>December 31, 1995<BR>by Felix Njoku, PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar - By and large, Africa will be the only continent not counting its blessings at the end of this century. And going by the state of most African countries at the end of 1995, one might well ask whether &quot;this blighted continent is under a kind of evil spell&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otherwise, how does one explain a situation whereby the continent has become an island of want and depravation in a world bristling with wealth and modernity.<BR>The superstitous trace the origin of the black race to the biblical figure Cain, the accursed brother of Abel, both born of Adam and Eve -- the first known couple on earth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A section of the Bible says Cain was condemned to perpetual servitude byGod after he killed his brother out of jealousy. The fugitive is said to have migrated to the area now known as Africa. Based on this unauthenticated reasoning, Africans are said to be the direct decendants of the &quot;Murderer&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least one religious sect, The Dutch Reformed Church used what many now believe to be a fallacy to justify the subjugation of black peoples in South Africa for centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some revisionists still think there could be some truth in the story.  Otherwise, they ask, how can anybody explain a situation where one particular race has had to bear the burden of humanity for so long?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only some sort of magical spell, they argue, could have made it possible for 20 million offsprings of one race to be shipped like logs thousands of miles across the Atlantic Ocean and enslaved for several centuries, for instance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slavery and long years of equally excruciating colonialism have now become history. Sometimes, discussion on their affect of on the black race come up in international fora but merely to support calls for assistance or feeble demands for reparations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The director-general of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation, Federico Mayor, Had cause to raise the subject once again at the beginning of the outgoing year. Mayor's point was that the rich West was heavily indebted to Africa in cash and kind. &quot;The modern wealth, power and dynamism of the West are in large measure the result of the forced contribution exacted from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This enormous contribution in the form of people, hard labour, sacrifice and also natural resources was exacted first by slavery and then by colonisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The massive and historically unprecedented haemorrhage slowly drained Africa of its very lifeblood, its vital, creative and productive energy, which we must today make heroic efforts to reconstitute, whatever the cost,&quot; Mayor said at a forum on development called Audience Africa he hosted February in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But analysts say while advocacy for Africa is most welcome, the situation in most of the countries today makes it almost impossible for them to put such assistance to good use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the lost decade of the 1980s, Africa was supposed to be a net beneficiary of the so-called dividend of the end of cold war and the collapse of the Belin wall. The belief, then, was that since the continent provided the battle ground for the East-West confrontation of the era, peace and prosperity would reign here as the big powers reconciled their differences.  This has not been the case. Spurred by the the wind of democracy (some call it &quot;demoncrazy&quot;), internacine instincts nurtured by colonialism and kept in the cooler by totalitarian regimes have begun to surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, since 1993 when Hutus and Tutusi in Burundi and Rwanda began to see virtue in drawing blood from one another, ethnic wars have assumed wider dimension on the continent. What the trend portends for a continent, home of one-third of the world's 6,000 major ethnic groups, can only be imagined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worse, in some African countries the ethnic card has been raised to the level of state craftsmanship. Recent &quot;democratic&quot; elections in Cote d'Ivoire took place over the corpses of dozens of poor people. Why? Violence was used to supress opposition protest against a constitutional disqualification of one of its own, to wit Alassan Ouattara, a former prime minister of the country in which he is now regarded as a &quot;foreigner&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Zambia the opposition is currently engaged in a running battle with the ruling party as the later tries to push an article in a draft constitution that would effectively bar some Zambians from contesting presidential elections. One of the people who would be affected by the new law is former President Kenneth Kaunda. He was born in the territory of Malawian parents before Zambia gained independence. The move seems to have backfired as incumbent President Frederick Chiluba and aides are now fighting hard to prove that his parents were not Zaireans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though paramount, these are not isolated cases. Divisions either on ethnic, linguistic, religious or racial grounds are mounting in many Africa countries, compromising national unity and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Farther afield sub-regional groups, which were supposed to foster integrated development, rather tend to assume the posture of hostile blocs with the potential of wrecking what remains of the African unity the likes of Kwame Nkrumah and Cheikh Anta Diop worked and died for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nine-rounds of polling held to select the President of the African Development Bank in Abuja and Abidjan in June and August, and the bad blood it bred between states is a pointer to the damage which such a posture could breed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apparently taking a cue from high quarters, it is not unsual now to hear Africans refer to folk from North, South, East and West of the continent in such derogatory terms that one begins to wonder what is happening. Some have fallen in love so much with the foreign languages they speak that stupid reference as &quot;francofools&quot; for Francophones and &quot;Anglophobes&quot; for Anglophones have become part of everday vocabulary. Naturally, this evil ingenuity leaves no room for anybody to discover and popularise the common &quot;Africophone&quot; heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poor Africans who migrate to neighbouring countries feel the pinch the most. They are tagged &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; and shipped back whence they came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The irony of this is that it is happening at a time when the concept of the state is shifting from geopolitical considerations to economic viability.  More successful states are girding themselves to face the challenges of &quot;ecostates&quot; while Africans, who constitute only one-tenth of the world population, are recoiling into their various ethnic cocoons. Is it not time Africans took a long walk down memory lane?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - They've had a long, hard season and several key members of their squad are weary after representing the national team, but Orlando Pirates can rise to the occasion against Ivory Coast's Asec Mimosa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the national team's recent triumph in the Four Nations tournament, there is still a belief that South African football is stronger at club level than at national level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consider this: we were readmitted into world soccer in 1992 and the following year Jomo Cosmos and Kaizer Chiefs represented South Africa in both Confedaration of African Football continental competitions. Chiefs failed narrowly to reach the semi-finals of the Champions Cup when they went down to Zamalek of Egypt. Cosmos were booted out of the Cup Winners Cup (Mandela Cup) semi-finals by Africa Sports of Ivory Coast. But it was their dismal performance on the domestic scene which hampered their progress to the final -- they had to sacrifice reaching the finals and try to save themselves from being relegated. But it is history now that they were relegated at the end of that season.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sundowns, however, could not proceed further than the Champions Cup second round in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tomorrow Orlando Pirates play Asec Mimosa of Ivory Coast in the finals of the Champions Cup. There are several similarities between the two teams.  Both became league champions of their countries in 1994 after boardroom discussions. They both boast a large, fanatical following.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The major difference is that Pirates had been starved of championship honours for 19 years while their opponents have virtually monopolised the Ivory Coast league title. Champions again this year, they have won the title for the last six years. Asec boast 10 internationals while Pirates have six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Zaki, who played alongside Daniel Amokachi, Rashid Yekini and the current African footballer of the year Emmanuel Amunike in the 1994 World Cup in the United States, is one of the stars at the disposal of coach Zare Mamadou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pirates have lost only once away from home in this competition when they went down 2-1 in Gabon against Mbilinga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asec also boast a remarkable away record: they lost once to Ismailia of Egypt in the semi- finals. This tells more about the style of play of both these teams, and Mamadou sums it up well when he says: &quot;We have not come here to defend but to try and win, and our away record says more about us. But we also know that Pirates have not lost a game at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will they be the first to dent the Buccaneers' impeccable home record in the face of vociferous support from the Pirates fans? Mamadou, backed by Nigerian under 23 international midfielder Akeem Ogulande, said: &quot;There are 22 players on the pitch and they are the people who influence the proceedings. Those in the stands can shout but they will remain where they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But they have their fears of the Pirates danger men: left back Edward Motale, the dazzling Brendon Silent and John Moeti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tsotetsi Phiri and Helman Mkhelele will be closely watched by the Ivorians. &quot;They are quick on the ball and if you don't close them down they can be dangerous,&quot;said Mamadou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Pirates have their own worries. Mkhelele, Moeti and Mark Fish all had a tough week representing the national team in the Four Nations matches and it is hoped they have not run out of energy after all the tough matches they have played this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fish may not be match-fit following a knock he received on his knee during the Zimbabwe game. Pirates coach Joe Frickleton was a bit hesitant about who is available for the match, saying: &quot;I will see how they respond to training.&quot;Pirates go into Saturday's game knowing very well that they will have to beat the Ivorians convincingly at home if they hope to lift the title at their first attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Asec team will be hoping that their opponents, backed by a home crowd, are not at the full strength which saw them reach the finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asec have failed four times before to reach the final and having reached the final after so many tries they feel that they are destined to be champions at last. &quot;We have been victims of bad refereeing for many years now that we have finally made it we hope to win, but if we lose it's all in the game,&quot; said Mamadou.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 1, 1995<BR>by Simon Segal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - With South Africa's inflation rate, down to 6,3 percent in October, at levels last seen in the early 1970s, much is being said about the economy entering a lower inflationary environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most economists (there are a few exceptions) see South Africa's inflation rate remaining in single digits both next year and in 1997, averaging seven to nine percent in 1996 and a slightly higher eight to 9,5 percent in 1997. This year's average should be around 8,6 percent compared to nine percent last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The falling rates on long-term bonds indicate that the bond market also believes lower inflation is here to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Reserve Bank's primary motivation in maintaining relatively high real (inflation- adjusted) interest rates is more to do with concerns about the country's foreign reserves than with inflationary pressures -- although the Bank's governor Chris Stals has built his reputation on being tough on inflation and is not about to relinquish his record of bringing it down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His concern is that talk about a low inflation era is tempered by pressures on real wage increases, government spending, dwindling manufacturing capacity and M3 money supply growth which, despite falling to 14,8 percent in October, is well outside the Bank's six to 10 percent target range for the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If this growth rate in M3 continues, M3 would end the year almost five percentage points above the upper limit of the target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While less emphasis is being placed by the monetary authorities on money supply, Stals has said growth in credit extension to the private sector -- 18 percent in September -- should be under 12 percent before a cut in the Bank rate can be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, it can be argued that South Africa's inflation, while low relative to the last two decades, is still high when compared to its major trading partners. Inflation is 1,8 percent in Germany, 3,2 percent in Britain, 2,8 percent in the United States and 0,2 percent in Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For all these reasons Stals, ever cautious, is in no hurry to believe that lower inflation is sustainable and hence to reduce the Bank rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa will have to live longer with high real interest rates. The real prime rate is now 12,2 percent compared to 4,45 percent in Germany, 4,55 percent in Britain, 5,95 percent in the US and 1,43 percent in Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economists are not even agreed that the next Bank rate move will be down. Some feel it could yet be raised further if inflationary pressures emerge and the capital flows into the country start to slow and put further pressure on the country's reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The real victory against inflation will be when inflationary expectations are snuffed out and will thus not be presented at wage negotiations and price setting meetings. Only then can one talk about a new era of low price rises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, there is still scepticism not only about the outlook for inflation but about the accuracy of the figures. Many consumers do not believe the figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the basket comprising the index used to calculate the inflation rate might be outdated and thus not accurately reflect spending patterns, there is little evidence that the inflation figures are grossly inaccurate and that the trend it reflects is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However accurate the figures, perceptions are what count in economics -- workers and managers are still linked in to a high-inflation mind- set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a major reason why South Africa will not experience the inflation levels of its major trading partners for some time to come.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 1, 1995<BR>by Reg Rumney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Mention &quot;electric car&quot; to your average motorist and you will be greeted with scepticism. They are probably thinking of the homely, battery-powered vans that once used to deliver milk to the sleepy suburbs. Or the ill-fated three-wheeler that made inventor Sir Clive Sinclair a laughing stock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The converted Honda Civic imported by Eskom as a prototype vehicle could not be more different.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a fairly powerful 100kW motor, it looks, feels, and drives like a normal petrol-powered car. However, you can't help but notice the substantial tunnel running down the middle of the vehicle. This contains the 28 12V lead- acid batteries that provide the DC electricity that converted to AC power, drives the quiet electric motor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quiet -- but not silent. As it accelerates smoothly towards its top speed of 136km an hour the car emits a high-pitched whine reminiscent of a Datsun Pulsar. The car accelerates from 0 to 100km/h in under nine seconds and the acceleration, unlike in a petrol car, is achieved without gear change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is almost linear,&quot;says Eskom's Dave Kombol of the car's acceleration, as he shows what the car can do with a full passenger load of four people. Kombol reckons it has more torque (ability to accelerate) than its petrol-driven equivalent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the car is not under-powered, as one would expect. If a second gear were used top speed could be increased to over 200km an hour -- and the car's range would be much lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The range is only around 120km before recharging, and that is using &quot;regeneration&quot;, in other words using the inertial (momentum) force of the car to recharge the batteries. When the regeneration switch is on, the car slows as the driver takes his foot off the acceleration pedal, just as if he had changed to a lower gear. Otherwise the car coasts to a stop under the force of gravity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without regeneration the range is halved. How far you can go on a single recharging of the batteries, which normally takes around six hours a time, also depends on how you drive. High-speed, aggressive driving decreases range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Applications in South Africa, where long distances are commonplace are limited, though electric vehicles (EVs) are being considered, for instance, for taxis at the Durban waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, according to Carel Snyman, who heads Eskom's electric vehicle programme, South African motor manufacturers, with their relatively short production runs, are ideally placed to take the lead in electric car production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cost is another problem, until mass production brings economies of scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Eskom prototype, imported from Canada, costs R200 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against this running costs are miserly, around 2,5c to four cents/km. It costs between five rand and six rand to recharge the car. So if a tank of petrol costs R95, the equivalent cost for recharging the converted Civic would be around R24, almost a fourth of a petrol- powered equivalent. Also, the batteries and the motor should outlast a petrol engine with careful driving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the electric car scores on money and doesn't do badly on power.  What's the catch?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EVs, as they are known in the US, were more numerous than vehicles driven by the internal combustion engine in the early days of motoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What put paid to them was the efficiency of petrol in storing energy, and refinements of the internal combustion engine to make it less polluting and more efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EVs were little more than drawing board dreams until pollution concerns in the US and Europe led to environmental demands for the reduction of damaging exhaust emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any case, the move towards mass production of affordable electric vehicles has been given impetus by California's tough pollution legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The California Air Resources Board has decided that beginning in 1998 two percent of all vehicles sold in California will have to have zero emission of noxious gases. That means that around 25 000 vehicles sold in 1998 will have to be electric vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditional automobile manufacturers have introduced a range of prototypes. Also, Calstart, which describes itself as an advanced transport consortium, has recently unveiled a purpose-built, personal electric car designed to cost under $10 000, or the equivalent of R36 000 or so. The two-passenger commuter car conforms, says Calstart, to US safety standards and has a range of 96 to 128 km. The thermoplastic body may put some South African motorists off, but the Norwegian car is designed to be a second vehicle for nipping around town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, The Guardian reports that EVs in French cities already number several thousand and are expected, thanks to a new government subsidy, to reach 100 000 in five years' time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> French car manufacturers are at the forefront of electric car production, with Renault being the first to construct battery-driven vehicles on the same production lines as its other models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While electric cars are no longer museum pieces or sci-fi fantasies, the problems of energy storage still remain, putting the EV tantalisingly out of reach of the ordinary driver. But hopes are now pinned on the development of a range of new batteries, such as the Zebra battery, an Anglo American initiative, or zinc-air batteries, which are not recharged but replenished by putting in fresh anodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When these are a commercial reality, the last hurdle will have fallen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 1, 1995<BR>by Shaun de Waal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Some years ago, I lamented in these pages that there was more African and Third World music to be found in London's Virgin Megastore than in all of South Africa. So it is pleasing to be able to report that since then things have changed, and the vast panoply of musics other than Anglo-American pop is now infinitely more accessible to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weve been visited by luminaries such as Salif Keita, Airto Moreira, Manu Dibango and Ismael Lo. Record companies are promoting world music with new vigour -- Polygram are pushing Island's Mango label, and Tusk have a &quot;Beautiful Music in a World of Noise&quot; campaign which, while its tagline might annoy lovers of grungy guitar, helps widen listeners' musical horizons. World music is on TV, inserted into CCV's Sonic Boom, and it's on radio, in SAfm's Afropop Worldwide. And, best of all, it's in the record shops.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A trawl through the most compendious volume on the subject, The Rough Guide to World Music (distributed by Penguin), gives one a sense of the vastness of the field -- and an idea of the riches waiting to be discovered.  The people who do the Rough Guides have been here, and a volume on South Africa is in the works. At last, we can enjoy the feeling that we're not just an outpost of Anglo-American culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rough Guide to World Music, which takes in everything from zouk to mbalax and gamelan to cumbias, points out that the term &quot;world music&quot;was originally invented for a month- long marketing campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1987, various London record companies found themselves frustrated by the fact that their African, Latin American and other releases weren't &quot;finding rack space because records stores had no obvious place to put them&quot;.  So they cooked up a label for the stuff that didn't go under Rock, Jazz, Male Vocal and the rest, and did a month's worth of marketing around it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the name stuck, occasionally varied with the term &quot;world beat&quot;, first coined by the Germans. For all its vagueness, it's the most convenient over-arching term for styles that are based on specific ethnic musics while maintaining a dialogue with pop and rock. This is the area in which the most interesting cross-overs are taking place: the best of world music is truly global, as influences overlap and mingle into a delicious masala of modes and textures. The variety subsumed under this banner is staggering, and generic lines are often hard to draw, but it's a start -- and the thrill of discovery awaits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, if we were to take a semi-arbitrary sample of what is now available, what would we come up with?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here are some new records worth trying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Zap Mama are a band of women led by Marie Daulne, who was born in Zaire of a Belgian father and a Zairean mother. Their new album, Sabsylma (Crammed Discs), displays an eclecticism that draws on pygmy music, gospel and doowop, set against Afro-Cuban rhythms. The vocals are the most prominent and pleasing aspect: Zap Mama sound at one moment like a traditional ceremony in full chant, at another like The Roches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Boukman Eksperyans is a Haitian band that hasn't always been on the right side of the island's rulers. The Duvalier regime apparently didn't take to music based on the ritual sounds of the voodoo cults, which is what Boukman Eksperyans do. Their latest album, Liberte (Pran Pou Pran'l!), on Mango, is propelled by African-style polyrhythms and garnished with rock guitar and even some synthesiser. It adds up to a very appealing mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Dadawa's Sister Drum (Tusk) is the first Chinese record to sell a million in the West, which is understandable: it's like nothing you've ever heard. With spine-chilling vocals that soar and sweep and seem to possess the very grandeur of the Himalayas, this really is a break from Western music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The singer is Zhu Zheqin, who stepped aside from a career as a popular Chinese chanteuse and, with the highly lauded composer-producer He Xuntian, delved into the sacred music of Tibet. I don't know what the result's political-correctness rating is (Tibet is still militarily occupied by China), but it makes an extraordinary CD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Mouth Music proves that world music doesn't have to come from the Third World -- there are alternatives in the First World too. Shorelife (Tusk), their third album, shows the Scottish group at full tilt, bringing Gaelic choral folk into collision with the trancy rhythms of ambient house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Global Village Trucking Company are based in Canada, though their membership seems multi- national. Crossing Borders (Global/S2) presents a brassy mix of reggae, funk, calypso and jazz, with danceable tunes and a rich big- band sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Salif Keita is one of the best-known of Africa's host of stars. His brand-new release, Folon (Mango), is masterful and affecting, overflowing with soulful sophistication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * And, not to be forgotten, there are any number of South Africans who are as much a part of world music as anyone. For a start, Tananas surely lead the pack. Gito Baloi's Ekaya (Polygram) is a pleasure, and so is Sankomota's first album, recorded a decade ago by the nascent Shifty Studios, and now re- released on CD by Tic Tic Bang. To my mind, it's still their best record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tic Tic Bang also market the Stern's catalogue, where you can find such wonders as Trinidad's Mighty Sparrow, and Talking Timbuktu, the acoustic-guitar collaboration between American Ry Cooder and Malian Ali Farka Toure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And that's just the tiniest scratch on the surface.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 1, 1995<BR>by Bruce Cohen (Column)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Carl Niehaus should know better. As one of the African National Congress' key media liaison figures during the run-up to the April 1994 elections, he got to know the press as well as any. So his outburst in the Sunday Independent this past weekend -- a contribution to the increasingly ugly but nonetheless vital debate over media control in this country -- was inexplicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue, he suggests, boils down to a conspiracy of (white) sub-editors who spike and maul the copy of black journalists!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The silliness of Niehaus' contribution is matched only by the attack of attorney Christine Qunta, who raged in the Sowetan last week against Mark Gevisser, arguably the country's most thoughtful writer. Gevisser, she alleges, uses &quot;elevate-to- assassinate&quot; tactics to destroy the black elite in his weekly profiles in the Mail &amp; Guardian. After all, he described Enterprise editor Thami Mazwai as &quot;spluttering&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mazwai, who has given the debate over media control a fresh and welcome kick-start, is also guilty of narrow typecasting, of reducing this important issue to white versus black, contributing to an unnecessary polarisation of hard-working journalists in this country and diverting focus away from the core problem facing the press in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crisis facing the South African press is not only one of colour. It is one of control. Three companies (Independent, Naspers and Times Media Limited) hold an intolerable monoply of ideas, information and communication.  Niehaus, in his hunt for a scapegoat, conveniently ignores his party's own responsibility for this. The ANC has systematically supported the further consolidation of the newspaper monopolies and has failed utterly to deal with the issue of promoting press diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the ANC that welcomed Tony O'Reilly into the country to grab from Anglo, at a price that defies logic, the assets of Argus newspapers and then to allow the baked bean king to consolidate his position so that he now holds a total monopoly of the English language daily newspaper market in Cape Town and Durban in addition to his control over the Gauteng market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the ANC that conveniently shut up as Times Media Limited (TML) quietly re-acquired the Daily Dispatch, giving TML an absolute control over the English daily press in East London and Port Elizabeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the ANC that turned a blind eye to Naspers' smooth share manoeuvre this month, which means the company -- with 100 percent control over the Afrikaans daily newspaper market -- will never have to let go.  (Naspers sells close to 250 000 newspapers per day.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The evil of bigness in itself may be debatable&quot;, says American media critic James Aronson, &quot;but the dangers of monopoly news and monoply opinion-making are not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the past few years I have been researching the increasing concentration of media ownership in South Africa, noting the shifts and changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have watched as, to tumultous welcome, Argus sold 52 percent of the Sowetan to Dr Nthato Motlana -- but retained direct control over the newspaper at every level. Argus (now Independent), apart from its 20 percent stake, continues to hold the printing, distribution, advertising and management contracts for the paper. In other words, de facto control.  (Motlana should be given credit for saving New Nation from a donor death-wish, but it too is now under Independent control.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have also noted Naspers' plans to sell some of the shares in City Press to black owners, but it will remain firmly at the helm of the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And I await JCI's efforts to turn TML into a black empowerment company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doubtless some black people will profit handsomely from owning a share of South Africa's newspaper monopolies and even influence the appointment of editors. But the truth is it alters only the colour -- not the structure -- of control of this key sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every day about 1,3-million daily newspapers are sold in South Africa.  If you think that is impressive, it is not. In terms of per capita penetration (newspaper sales as a percentage of population), this is a penetration of around three percent, alongside countries like Tunisia, India, Botswana and Brazil. Contrast this with the penetrations of newspapers in countries like Norway (62 percent), Japan (58 percent) and the UK (36 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of these 1,3-million daily newspapers, 57 percent belong directly to, or are controlled by, Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers (formerly Argus).  If we ignore the Afrikaans Press, then fully 75 percent of all English language daily newspapers sold in this country are O'Reilly papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O'Reilly's monopoly is truly awesome at a metropolitan level. In the country's second and third biggest cities (Cape Town and Durban), every single English daily metro newspaper -- morning and afternoon -- is an O'Reilly newspaper (Cape Times, The Argus, Daily News and Mercury). In Johannesburg and Pretoria, where around 580 000 daily English language papers are sold, O'Reilly controls 70 percent of the market (The Star, Sowetan, Pretoria News).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few countries in the world can boast such a massive concentration of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether these monopolies employ white or black editors is a very important issue and Mazwai has rightly thrown down the gauntlet. But what matters more is their power in the market, in their extraordinary influence and control over the advertising and distribution channels -- whether anyone else (black or white) could ever get a foot in the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In many countries there is clear recognition of the umbilical link between a diversity of press voices and the proper functioning of a democracy. They acknowledge that without state support, freedom of expression would become the right of the few who could afford to publish their opinions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These countries -- and they include Sweden, Norway, France, Holland, and Belgium -- actively promote and support diversity of the press with a variety of financial incentives and tax breaks. They acknowledge that the state bears significant responsibility for the fulfilment of the goal of promoting a democratic -- diverse -- press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some take press diversity so seriously that they channel public funds directly into small newspapers. Countries like Austria, France, Sweden and Holland have devised elaborate schemes to ensure that all sectors of society have adequate media voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of blaming pale sub-editors and intelligent writers for the miserable state of the South African press, Niehaus and others ought to be tackling the real issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bruce Cohen is executive trustee of the South African Newspaper Education Trust and governing council member of the Media Institute of Southern Africa. He helped found the Independent Media Diversity Trust and has been involved in numerous media development programmes and projects aimed at strengthening the independent press in Southern Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The government was tight-lipped this week on why it has back-pedalled on a commitment to give diplomatic recognition to Africa's last colony, the Saharawi Republic, where the Polisario Front has been leading its struggle for freedom from Moroccan occupation of its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa is the only country in Southern Africa and one of the few Organisation of African Unity members which has ties with Morocco but does not recognise the Saharawi Republic as an independent state. In a letter in June, President Nelson Mandela promised that links would be established and this was subsequently confirmed by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and South Africa's OAU ambassador. Days later, however, a Saharawi representative was informed by foreign affairs officials that implementation of the decision would have to wait.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad said yesterday that in consultation with the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity, it had been decided that diplomatic recognition ahead of a UN-supervised referendum in the area would not be helpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pressed to explain why, he referred queries to the president's office, saying the UN and OAU had met with Mandela directly. Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said: &quot;We're not willing to comment on this matter at this stage. It is a subject of discussion which involves a number of parties.&quot; He declined to elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saharawi representative Sidati Mohamed said this week he believed the South African government was using the United Nations-supervised referendum pending in the territory as a pretext for the delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Independent observers, including Human Rights Watch, have reported extensively on Moroccan human rights abuses and manipulation of the referendum process, which has been repreatedly delayed and now appears to be in danger of not taking place at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not asking for human or financial or military support, but to get our flag and a diplomatic mission, like any other country,&quot; Mohamed said.  &quot;The president made a commitment. It is unacceptable to use the referendum and UN gestures as an excuse to delay recognition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The old South African regime had extensive links with Morocco during the apartheid years, while the ANC forged links with Polisario. In 1988, the late president of the ANC, Oliver Tambo, pledged continued support for the Saharawi people's struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suggestions are now doing the rounds that Morocco has some leverage over the government. Pahad denied this &quot;absolutely&quot;. He said South Africa had an observer in the OAU delegation in the Western Sahara. &quot;We are constantly consulting. We are awaiting final reports on the matter. There is no question of Morocco influencing the president's view,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs this week opposed the government's stand on two of the most contentious international relations issues of recent months: relations with the Nigerian military regime, and South Africa's failure to support an outright international ban on landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Nigeria, the committee called for a &quot;broad reconsideration of strategy&quot;, which would involve the South African government taking account of the views of &quot;all sections of Nigerian society, in particular the opposition movement within the country and in exile&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has been criticised in recent weeks for ignoring the wishes of the Nigerian opposition, most notably when Deputy President Thabo Mbeki undertook an official visit to Nigeria without meeting pro-democracy activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concerning landmines, the committee called for &quot;a ban on the production, use and transfer of all types of anti-personnel landmines&quot; to be enshrined in South African law. This directly contradicts the position taken by South Africa at the review conference on the United Nations Conventional Weapons Convention in Vienna in September this year. In Vienna, South Africa joined the world's military powers supporting the phasing out of existing landmines in favour of &quot;smart mines&quot;, which are designed to disarm automatically after a specified period of time. Support for &quot;smart mines&quot; has been condemned by human rights activists and by countries such as Mozambique, which are still plagued by mines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Frontline activists from the United States, Rwanda, Mexico and Tibet have been named recipients of the 1995 Reebok Human Rights Award for their leadership in safeguarding human rights and fighting injustice.  They will be recognized at a December 5th award ceremony at Harlem's world-famous Apollo Theatre, an historic center of artistic expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Reebok Human Rights Award, now in its eighth year, acknowledges Angela Elizabeth Brown, 30, from Georgia, for her work as a student/youth organizer, and for her leadership in battling environmental injustice throughout the Southern region of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I proudly join Reebok in celebrating the vision and tenacity of the recipients of this year's awards,&quot; said former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, a member of the Reebok Human Rights Board of Advisors. &quot;These young leaders, who are willing to take great personal risks to create new possibilities for human justice, hold the key to a better future for people around the world.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year, we're very excited to be celebrating the eighth annual Reebok Human Rights Award and the achievements of these courageous human rights advocates at the Apollo Theatre in New York City,&quot; said Paul Fireman, Chairman and CEO, Reebok International Ltd. &quot;When it opened as a black theatre in 1934, the Apollo gave a voice, and a livelihood, to a broad range of artists and it spawned a rich musical heritage. It has been at the center of cultural life in Harlem, but its legacy reaches far beyond its famous marquee. The Apollo has made an indelible contribution to America's cultural diversity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard Nsanzabaganwa, 26, a Rwandan national of Tutsi ethnic origin, is bravely working to bring justice to victims of the 1994 genocide of half a million people, in a weakened country with a judicial system which has become nearly extinct. Approximately 47,000 prisoners nationwide have been detained on suspicion that they participated in the genocide, with approximately 100 prisoners dying each month due to disease and overcrowding. The personally suffered abuses, and his family was massacred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the chief investigator of the Mission Permanente de Surveillance of the Association Rwandaise des Droits de l'Homme(ARDHO), Mr. Nsanzabaganwa travels the country gathering information and taking testimony from survivors, in an effort to bring justice to these human rights atrocities.  One supporter said of Mr. Nsanzabaganwa: &quot;What happened in Rwanda will remain a blemish on the face of humankind, but to bring attention to the selfless work of one of the individuals who continues to risk his life to resist the mass insanity of hatred in this country would be a small step in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miguel Angel de los Santos Cruz, 30, a Mexican attorney based in Chiapas represents indigenous people who have suffered human rights abuses. His nonpartisan efforts to assure fair access to legal representation for all people--particularly individuals who cannot afford it and those cases brought against the state--have led him to consistently accept the most difficult, unpopular cases that few lawyers in Chiapas would choose to take on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ven. Phuntsok Nyidron, 27, a Tibetan Buddhist nun who courageously asserted her right to free speech in protesting the Chinese occupation of Tibet, is serving a 17-year prison sentence. The Chinese government initially arrested her for leading a peaceful demonstration in 1989. According to the testimony received from a released Tibetan nun, she and fellow demonstrators were beaten with iron rods and tortured with electric batons while in prison.  For the &quot;crime&quot; of recording Tibetan independence songs on a tape recorder smuggled into her prison cell, she was sentenced to an additional eight years in prison. Ven. Phuntsok Nyidron's cumulative sentence is seventeen years, the longest of any female political prisoner in Tibet. She is a symbol of freedom of expression, an extraordinary woman who continues to nonviolently advance the cause of human rights at the cost of her own personal freedom and safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Established in 1988, the Reebok Human Rights Award recognizes young people on the front lines of human rights work who--early in their lives and against great odds--have had a significant impact in their communities. It is the only corporately supported human rights award to acknowledge young rights activists for their outstanding contribution and personal sacrifice.  Candidates must be no more than 30 years of age and cannot advocate violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To support the work of the recipients. The Reebok Foundation will distribute $25,000 to a human rights organization designated by each recipient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Award recipients are chosen annually by the Reebok Human Rights Board of Advisors, which includes: President Jimmy Carter, 39th president of the United States; Paul Fireman, Chairman and CEO of Reebok International LTD; Peter Gabriel; musical artist; Rafer Johnson, Olympic decathlete and President of the California Special Olympics; C. Joseph LaBonte, Chairman and CEO, Jenny Craig; Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights; Elaine Jones, Director-Counsel, NAACP Legal Defense Fund; Li Lu, 1989 Reebok Human Rights Award recipient; Angel Martinez, President and CEO, the Rockport Co.; Michael Posner, Executive Director of the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights; Michael Stipe, musical artist; Rose Styron, poet and journalist; Leonard Zakim, Executive Director of the Northeast Region, Anti-Defamation League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the Human Rights Award, Reebok supports &quot;Witness,&quot; a program that supplies human rights groups with video cameras, fax machines and other tools of mass communication to help them fight injustice. The Witness program was created in 1992 through a unique partnership between musical artist Peter Gabriel, the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights and The Reebok Foundation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Besieged by accusations of fanning trouble in neighbouring countries, President Yoweri Museveni has said Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi hates him because he fears Museveni's revolution could inspire Kenyans to rise against their ailing leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Because we came to power through the gun and have been successful, Moi thinks we set a bad example which his own people might follow (and overthrow him),&quot; Museveni told a press conference in Kampala yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference was also addressed by President Silvestre Ntibatunganya of Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Otherwise I don't know what the problem between Uganda and Kenya is; it's (due to) mismanagement at the top,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda and Kenya have had frosty relations since 1986 when Museveni's NRM shot its way to power after a five-year guerrilla war. In the latest flare up, Ugandan officials claimed that Ugandan rebel groups backed by Kenyan troops early this month allegedly camped on the common border and withdrew after two weeks without incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Sudan, Museveni said their problem started in the 1950s when he was in Junior Three. &quot;If they want to solve it they must address issues in the South,&quot; Museveni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan has been accusing Uganda of participating in the latest southern-based SPLA rebel offensive that has seen them gain territory previously lost to Khartoum forces. Museveni said most leaders in the region fear the NRM because of its successes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They think we are bad people--revolutionaries who set a bad precedent for their own people to follow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've succeeded in building the economy, the politics is doing well, so they think their people will copy us and overthrow them,&quot; Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni said Uganda, which suffered bad leadership in the past has solved its internal problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Today fighting in Uganda is through the microphone, though some people are still using the gun; they've been marginalised,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In fact if the verbal missiles that my political opponents send me were real bullets I'd have died a long time ago,&quot; Museveni said bemusedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni said all regional leaders had agreed to convene a regional conference to discuss the problems of Rwanda and Burundi. The conference will attract delegates from Kenya, Tanzania and Zaire which hosts millions of refugees from the war-charred central African republics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We presidents are too busy; but we want to appoint eminent persons to meet for weeks or months and find a solution to Rwanda and Burundi's problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Ntibatunganya said merging Tutsi in Burundi and Rwanda into one state and Hutus in another state was no solution to the ethnic conflict.  &quot;The problem is not about tribes, but about setting rules of acquiring power and ending the perception that countries are tribes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ntibatunganya said merging Tutsi in Burundi and Rwanda into one state and Hutus into another state was no solution to the ethnic conflict. &quot;The problem is not about tribes, but about setting rules of acquiring power and ending the perception that countries are tribes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ntibatunganya said the nine fugitive Burundian soldiers suspected of masterminding the 1993 coup in which President Melchoir Ndadaye died were free to go home; but would stand trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They can come, but Burundi has a law which they'll be subjected to,&quot; Ntibatunganya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nine army officers have been living in Uganda since the 1993 failed putsch. Authorities in Bujumbura have wanted the soldiers extradited but to no avail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told journalists that over half a million Barundi who came here in the 1950s had almost become Ugandans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've (with Ntibatunganya) compared notes regarding aspects of our history which can help us solve the problem,&quot; said President Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said ten years ago Uganda was like Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We had half a million refugees in the region, a sectarian army, Obote and Amin had massacred almost a million people but we've solved all this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;So I can be influential in finding a solution to Burundi's problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Monitor (Kampala)<BR>November 8-10, 1995<BR>by Vukoni Lupa-Lasaga</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Only hours after the Sudanese People's Liberation Army(SPLA) launched a surprise attack against the Sudanese government forces on October 25, Khartoum accused Uganda of fighting alongside the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan has also accused Eritrea, Tanzania, Egypt, and lately South Africa of involvement in the Sudanese civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has sine threatened a Jihad (holy war) against Uganda. However, both SPLA and Ugandan officials quickly denied Sudan's allegations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The Ugandan troops, an army division supported by tanks and armored vehicles, are still on Sudanese soil and the fighting is still going on, but our forces are working hard to repulse the invading Ugandan troops,' Ali Osman Mohammed Taha, Sudan's foreign minister had told journalists in Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Col Kahinda Otafiire, Uganda's Minister of State for Security, however, retorted that Sudan's charges were 'a big joke and nonsense.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPLA also dismissed Khartoum's charges as mere propaganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'In the past when we defeated them, they said Ethiopians or Americans or Israelis were helping us,' Steven Wundu, a Nairobi-based SPLA spokesman was reported as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no love lost between Uganda and Sudan. But was this part of the traditional accusations Khartoum and Kampala have been trading against each other for nearly a decade? Or is there more to the current SPLA offensive than meets the eye?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coming at the beginning of the dry season which is usually the period the Sudanese army launches its mechanized offensive against the southern Sudanese rebels, the SPLA blitzkrieg is admittedly surprisingly uncharacteristic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that alone would not be sufficient proof of Ugandan complicity, though Ibrahim Omar, Sudan's Higher Education and Scientific Research Minister charged last Wednesday that the tactics of the opponents his government's troops encountered were typical of the Ugandan army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Military tactics are not patented and the SPLA appears to have grown wiser and borrowed a leaf from the NRA's and RPF's battlefield successes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in terms of motives, Sudan's accusing finger may not be pointing in a void. The NRM government feels very strongly about the northern rebellion, which Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army are still carrying on. The LRA's massacre of over 250 civilians in Atiak in April caused a break in diplomatic relations with Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More important, Ugandan military officers have been on the record, advocating for the NRA (now UPDF) pursuing the LRA in their alleged safe havens in Sudan. Since these are (were?) behind Sudanese government army lines it would have meant engaging Khartoum's forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, the commander of the reserve army, revealed in June that he has been in favor of Uganda invading Sudan for the repeated bombings of towns in northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against this background, Uganda has the motive for attacking Sudan either directly using its own troops or by proxy through supporting the SPLA, something that the Sudanese government has always accused it of doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But motive and the will plus the means to carry out such an invasion are two different things. It is certainly easier to allege than to prove that UPDF and Eritrean troops are fighting alongside the SPLA in southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the Rwanda civil war, the defunct MNRD government and scores of Ugandans were convinced that the RPF had bases and support in Uganda.  However, several checks at suspected camps and conduits by Rwandese delegations, diplomats and UN monitors left the late Juvenal Habyarimana and his men looking like bad liars and fools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The truth in such circumstances often comes out many years after the embers of was have burnt themselves out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is much safer and more useful in the meantime to say that the way the war in Sudan goes is terribly important for Uganda, not only because of the immediate benefits of the SPLA destroying the Kony rebel camps, but also in the light of regional politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum clearly hops that the spectre of conquest by Uganda will galvanise flagging support in the north for the economically crippling southern war, and simultaneously attract the sympathy of other states in the region, who are wary of Uganda's alleged reputation for exporting revolution to neighboring countries. It may also be the excuse for making more air raids in Northern Uganda or even invading the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether states with interests in the East and Central Africa region will believe Sudan's or Uganda's (and SPLA's) version of what is happening in southern Sudan will, therefore, be crucially important in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This fact is certainly not lost on President Yoweri Museveni, who has been on the diplomatic rounds. Over the weekend he met President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Col Muammar Qaddafi of Libya, the two most important Arab neighbors of Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though the contents of the talks between these heads of state have not been disclosed, Sudan was likely to have been top on the agenda. Museveni must not only find common cause with these states but foil Sudan's attempts of raising racial (Arab) and religious (Islamic) sentiments in the region and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While in Cairo, Museveni called for international sanctions against Sudan for its alleged assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa last June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also appealed to African government to isolate states which are sponsoring terrorism on the continent. That is some noise which is host and the West especially the Americans, must have relished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni carefully avoided talking about Sudan's latest accusations.  Kenya. one of Uganda's most suspicious neighbors, has kept eerily silent on the Sudan saga. Though recently President Daniel arap Moi accused Uganda of harbouring South African mercenaries poised for an invasion of Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan is already making that connection. Beyene Russom, Eritrea's ambassador to Kenya, yesterday told 'The Monitor' that Sudan's embassy in Nairobi has been circulating a news bulletin which accuses South Africa of being involved in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the past is anything to go by, for Moi the adage that my enemy's enemy is my friend will remain the mainstay of his alliances in the Eastern African region. It is unlikely that he will miss the opportunity of pitching in for Sudan as he has already gone on the brink by identifying closely with the Habyariman's men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What remains to be seen is whether Moi, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and the former Rwandan rulers be now hosts will close ranks and actively ally with Sudan as has often been reported in the past.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>December 4, 1995<BR>by Osman Njuguna</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Can churches that propagate divergent opinions have a common understanding on issues that have previously divided them? Would revisiting theological differences not open up &quot;old wounds&quot;? And what measures should be applied to improve relations between &quot;related&quot; churches that do not agree on certain principles?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These were among some of the questions posed at a recent meeting that brought together theological scholars, researchers and lay people from both the African instituted independent churches and the mission-founded churches under a historic consultation, in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the November 20 to 24 meeting, Malawian Catholic Bishop Patrick Kalilombe, told the 60 participants that &quot;while the old issues that tended to separate us still exist in the name of traditional beliefs, healing and worship, we must make efforts towards coming closer to each other. All of us in both the African instituted and mainstream churches must strive to cement this relationship for the benefit of the present and future Africans,&quot; stressed Bishop Kalilombe as he introduced the theme of the five day consultation, &quot;Building Bridges&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consultation, the first of its kind in the region, was organised by the Centre for Black and White Christian Partnership (CBWCP) based in Birmingham, United Kingdom and the Nairobi-based Organisation of African Instituted Churches (OAIC). Bishop Kalilombe is the current director of CBWCP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At both plenary and group sessions, participants discussed the historical relationships between the African traditional churches (also referred to as indigenous churches) and the churches otherwise seen as mission churches. Bishop Kalilombe who chaired some of the sessions told APS; &quot;One of the major achievements of the consultation was the positive way in which participants related to one another, the mode of discussion and the issues at hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Differences between mission and traditional churches are many, ranging from the basis of Christianity to other beliefs. In some instances, the two have differed about the mode of preaching the Word of God and how traditional African beliefs and cultural practices should be reconciled with worship. The principal teachings of some mission-founded churches have shown contempt for indigenous practices of the African people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the mission-founded churches have accused African independent churches of putting too much stress on healing and the power of the Holy Spirit in their pastoral duties. But a renowned Kenyan theologian, Dr. John Mbiti, says there is a general indication that the Holy Spirit is particularly more elevated in the African independent churches and in the charismatic movement than in the traditional mission of historical churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delivering a public lecture at the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) last August, under the topic, &quot;Axes Carried in the Same Bag Cannot Avoid Rattling: Reflections of the Holy Spirit and the Spirits in African Religious Experiences,&quot; Dr. Mbiti cited one of the outstanding features of the African independent churches as their identification with the Holy Spirit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many African independent churches incorporate aspects of the Holy Spirit in their names says Dr. Mbiti. He cites a wide range of names among them, the African Church of the Holy Spirit, African Eden Roho (Spirit) Society, African Roho Mission; African Evangelist Fellowship Healing and African Spiritual Israel Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his paper, on ecumenical relationships in Ghana, Rev. Thomas Oduro, who heads the Good News Theological College and Seminary in Accra, cites a number of factors which brought about sour relationships between the independent and mainline churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to the belief among some mainline churches that independent churches are occultic and not Christian, Rev. Oduro adds; &quot;This belief is based on individual narrated testimonies of some of the returnee prodigal children of the mainline churches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Oduro suggested to the Nairobi meeting measures that can be effective in strengthening the poor relationship between the spiritual and the mainline churches. He quoted Bishop Isaac Wotumi, the immediate past president of the Council of Pentecostal Churches of Ghana, who had proposed the introduction of inter-church conventions to bridge the relation gap. He further referred to another Ghanaian clergy Rev. Mintah, who is of the opinion that mediation by ecumenical bodies such as the World Council of Churches (WCC) among others that command respect in the mainstream churches, can improve such relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But personally, as the principal of a theological institution which was established primarily to serve the AIC, I believe that the best way to develop an on-going relationship of mutual respect between the independent and mainline churches is through biblical education,&quot; Rev. Oduro recommended.  He is convinced that as the leadership of the AICs gets better training in Christian theology and skills of Christian ministry, then the independent churches will be more open to interaction with their brothers and sisters in the mainline churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, as leaders of the mainline churches begin to experience the depth of knowledge and ability of such educated AIC leaders, they will be more open to listen to what independent churches have to say, adds Rev. Oduro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Giving an overview of the Eastern African region, Rev. Njeru Wambugu, underscored the need for both independent and mainline churches to come together and confess their sins to one another before any good relationship can be realised. But like most delegates at the consultation, Rev. Wambugu, who is currently the Acting General Secretary of the OAIC, hailed the meeting as a step in the right direction towards bringing understanding between the AICs and the mainline churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his contribution, Ronald Nathan of the African and Caribbean Evangelical Alliance, United Kingdom, called for the strengthening of the relationship between the AICs in Africa, Caribbean and Europe. &quot;We need to cement the relations between us (AICs) in Africa, Caribbean and Europe, before we look for the best way to bring forth effective relations between the AICs and the mainline churches,&quot; he suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fidelia Onyuku-Opukiri, a Nigerian woman heading the Born Again Christ Healing Church in Britain, complained that &quot;some of the mainline churches have deliberately decided to down play the &quot;ministry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of healing and prophesy as perceived by the AICs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Father Olua Abiola of the Aladura International Church, one of the independent churches based in Britain called upon all AICs to unite, lamenting that &quot;we are facing many problems in the world over. We need to unite to conquer those problems,&quot; he told the Nairobi consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Referring to the independent churches in the United Kingdom, Fr. Abiola, said, &quot;We are still struggling with the issue of being recognised. We are still being down-graded, due to our colour. We need a serious spiritual front to make our African voice heard both among the African people on the continent and in the diaspora.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Gerrie Haars from the Catholic Theological University in Netherlands who has recently authored a book on the controversial Zambian Catholic Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo, Spirit of Africa; Healing Ministry of the Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo of Zambia, commended both the CBWCP and OAIC for funding the meeting. She described the consultation as one of the most effective ways to improve relationships between African independent and mainlines churches. &quot;There is too much to know about each other if our intention of bridging the gap between us - AICs and the mainlines churches is to be realised,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of the meeting, delegates nevertheless acknowledged the visible cooperation between both churches, highlighting theological training of AICs members in institutions that are owned by mainline churches. They also recommended that AICs and their leaders record their history in writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the African independent churches represented at the consultation included the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa; African Divine Church, The Aladura International Church; Shepherds Christian Mission; Moshoeshoe Bible Readers Church; and God's Last Appeal Church. Mainline churches that were represented included the Anglican, Catholic, Presbyterian and Methodist churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Established in 1978, the OAIC has an estimated 10 million members represented through some 30,000 independent churches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1720 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>December 4, 1995<BR>by Wafula John</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bruising battle for and against the use of contraceptives is bound to hot up in sub-Saharan Africa. It began to gather momentum in 1992 when the World Health Organisation (WHO) gave a new lease of life to the controversial three- month injectable, depot medroprogesterone acetate (DMPA), known by the brand name Depo-provera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Depo-Provera was at the heart of a controversy in some African countries in the late 1980s. In Kenya a Member Parliament even moved a motion to put a ban on the injectable, claiming it caused cancer and obesity among other maladies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This damning reputation has been ameliorated by the WHO. In an August 1995 report published by Population Reports, a John Hopkins School of Public Health publication, WHO is reported as having &quot;produced largely reassuring results about the 3-month injectable (Depo- Provera) and cancer.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approved Depo-Provera in 1992, 25 years after the manufacturer, the Upjohn Company, first applied. This consent, was a much sought after shot in the arm. It reassured some consumers of Depo-Provera's safety, while giving the contraceptive legitimacy and the Upjohn Company profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is now increasingly providing Depo-Provera to developing countries, more so those of sub-Saharan Africa. USAID is poised to deliver 2.6 million doses of Depo-Provera to Third World countries this year. Some of the largest consignments are destined for sub-Saharan Africa, with Mozambique getting 248,000 doses, Tanzania 206,400 and Nigeria 200,000 doses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Population Reports indicates that between 1960 and 1995, countries registering Depo-Provera as a contraceptive rose from three to 106, while between 1992 and 1994 the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF) alone increased its supply for injectable contraceptives to developing countries, much of it to sub-Saharan Africa from 12 million to 20 million doses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, this rapid increment in the consumption of contraceptives in Africa does not augur well for conservatives led by the Catholic Church. Pope John Paul II has made it blatantly clear to the church's 92 million adherents in Africa that the use of contraceptives as a family planning devise is unacceptable. He has insisted that the only acceptable method by the Catholic Church is natural means of family planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the Pope has reportedly admitted that &quot;one cannot deny the existence, especially in the Southern hemisphere, of a demographic problem which creates difficulties for development,&quot; he has none the less insisted that &quot;human life, even if weak and suffering, is always a splendid gift of God's goodness,&quot; and that &quot;the church stands for life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Catholic church, life exists even before conception, hence, contraceptives interfere with life. Some Catholic scholars insist that industrialised countries of the North have a hidden agenda in their aggressive campaign against rapid population increase among Africans. &quot;The rich but declining nations feel threatened to lose political power and economic privilege to the large populations of the South. Population is a highly political issue, because population also means power,&quot; writes Wolfgang Schonecke in WAJIBU, a Kenyan journal of social and religious concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He further argues that &quot;some important population control organisations have historical roots in racist and eugenecist ideologies.&quot; Eugenics is the science of the production of intelligent children with the aim of improving the human species through the control of hereditary factors in mating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Schonecke quotes Margaret Sanger, founder of International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) as having written in May 1919, &quot;more children from the fit, less from the unfit: that is the chief issue of birth control.&quot; Hence he sees the present accelerated campaign against Third World populations through donor agencies who are bombarding them with contraceptives as a means to annihilate &quot;the unfit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clear as the Catholic church's view is on the use of contraceptives, it seems to be pulling its punches while donor agencies unleash an onslaught of contraceptives on African populations. Deliveries of Depo-Provera by the IPPF to the Third World have increased from 336,000 doses in 1991 to 735,000 in 1994. USAID is said to have delivered 2.6 million doses of Depo-Provera in the Third World countries in 1995 up from one million doses in 1994. A substantial amount of these doses ends up in sub- Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa have been singled out as the highest consumers of donor-distributed contraceptives in sub-Saharan Africa.  In Kenya, of the 97 per cent of the population's married women said to be aware of modern contraceptives, 27 per cent are users, up from a mere six percent in 1982. Kenya is said to be a model sample having increased four-fold its contraceptive consumption in just ten years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of Botswana's 96 percent married women aware of contraceptives, 33 per cent are users, up from 29 per cent in 1984. In Zimbabwe, 99 per cent of the married women are said to be aware of modern family planning methods. Among them, 43 per cent are users, an increment of three per cent in 10 years.  South Africa's women with 49 per cent users are said to be the highest consumers of modern family planning methods in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever conservatives say about the use of contraceptives, they seem to be losing the bout and possibly the battle on the African soil. African families are increasingly relying on available family planning methods to space their children, delay conception or halt it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. J. O. Orero, an obstetrician and well known gynaecologist practising in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, concedes that demand for contraceptives is on the increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about the safety of Depo-Provera, Dr. Orero said that like any other drug, it has side effects. &quot;Hence, users must be counselled, advised and given choices. It is up to them to make informed judgement,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Orero said that earlier research findings on Depo-Provera were misleading since they were not conducted on human beings. Animals subjected to higher doses of Depo-Provera during tests developed swellings associated with cancer particularly on their breasts. &quot;However, &quot;various studies done on human beings have proved that the contraceptive is safe,&quot; he added. This view has been bolstered by the WHO which asserts that its studies found no relationship between Depo- Provera and cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever controversy surrounds Depo-Provera, a source at the Family Planning Association of Kenya (FPAK) echoing Dr. Orero's views, said that the contraceptive is used widely in Kenya. Thus conservatives would have to deal with yet another blow from a vast African female population which is increasingly becoming receptive to the use of contraceptives, even those that earlier users viewed with disdain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Increasingly, African leaders, in an attempt to modernize and improve the quality of individual lives, are becoming allies of those advocating modern family planning methods. Almost all sub-Saharan countries are advocating for &quot;better planned families.&quot; In this quest, government owned mass media are becoming increasingly crucial in creating collective mass awareness of modern family planning. With the aid of mainly Western donor agencies, most sub-Saharan governments are also seeking to implement appropriate family planning policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the family level, &quot;African couples seem to be gropping around for a surer way of avoiding large families,&quot; says Dr. Simiyu Kaliba, a family planning consultant based in Nairobi. The mounting cost of education, the growing number of educated females and female headed households, urbanization, and a host of other social and economic factors are all contributing to an increasing grassroots desire to plan family size, &quot; says Dr. Kaliba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unfortunately, the most effective way to plan African families, with all its attendant side effects, is through modern family planning methods. We know no other with as much guarantee,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the question of whether to use or not to use contraceptives rages on, Dr. Kaliba warns that not all those at the fore front of bombarding sub-Saharan Africa &quot;with modern contraceptives are genuinely interested in our plight. Some are in lucrative business,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His concern echoes scholar Wolfgang Shonecke's warning that &quot;contraception is a multi-billion business and pharmaceutical companies are very interested to enlarge their market.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Remgro has said that the aim of the merger was to position it &quot;to participate in any potential industry consolidation&quot; while giving Richemont entry to the South African market, few see any immediate or tangible benefits arising out of the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It will not increase Remgro earnings as it will get a third of the profits of the new group based on its existing tobacco interests,&quot; said one analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others were more cynical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The bottom line is that this will help (chairman) Johan Rupert realise his life-long ambition of extracting as much money out of South Africa as he can,&quot; another analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rupert has long railed against the government in general and the Reserve Bank in particular for not allowing local firms to invest freely abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He obviously feels that he has invested enough in South Africa and that it is time to go abroad in a bigger way ... there will certainly be no material benefits here,&quot; the analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a certain bet that the new company will be based abroad and not all profits will find their way back here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said there was nothing &quot;sinister&quot; in this, but a reflection of the fact that some profits would be held back by the new company for further investment elsewhere, probably in Eastern Europe, which is a hot favourite among tobacco companies these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Remgro will have a one-third interest in the new company, which will pay dividends bi- annually of at least 50 percent of its consolidated attributable income. It will have a joint operating profit of sterling 700- million while its net tangible assets will be more than sterling one-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They also claim that the new company will be able to undertake an extensive rationalisation of production facilities in Africa, but to what extent that should precipitate this move in questionable,&quot; the analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been some speculation that Remgro's next step could be to unbundle or restructure its industrial assets. But troubled subsidiaries such as Hunt Leuschars and Hepburn (HL&amp;H) are believed to require huge injections of cash to get back on their feet and were not likely to be prime candidates for sale for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Remgro and Richemont last week reported strong results, which, together with the news of the merger, significantly boosted share prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But I'd rather be in Richemont than Remgro at the moment,&quot; said one analyst.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Attempts to restructure parastatals throughout sub-Saharan Africa have been the focus of fundamental discussions recently.  Two conferences, addressing this issue and setting scenarios for market-related developments and economic changes, have been held in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two weeks ago a bosberaad, headed by Minister of Public Enterprises Stella Sicgau, was held in Warmbaths to review deliberations and efforts to restructure the whole gamut of parastatals in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week an international indaba, also opened by Sicgau, was held at the Eskom Conference Centre in Midrand on &quot;power sector reform and efficiency improvement in sub-Saharan Africa.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference was largely a sequel to the bank's Roundtable Conference held in 1993, stirred by concern about the sector's poor performance in the Third World. Work began in 1988 when the bank initiated a review of policies and programmes related to this sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main themes and spirit of the bank's studies and recommendations, as well as developments already under way in Africa and other developing countries to effect sector reforms, set the agenda for the Midrand conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the major provider of funds and facilitator of development in the Third World, the bank's position on this issue is crucial. It is part of its overall economic structural adjustment programme to redirect and prime the economies of the developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The power sector in the Third World is, according to the bank, quite dismal. Between 1979 to 1988 it has been adversely marked by:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * a decline in average real power tariffs;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * a deterioration of the quality of service;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * poor maintenance of plants;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * inadequate metering, billing and collection;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * poor management;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * and government interference in daily affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Financial statistics have been as depressing. On average, rates of return have fallen from nine percent before the mid-1970's to five percent in 1991; self-financing ratios were 12 percent in 1991 against required targets of 20 to 60 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The deteriorating macro-economic situation and the debt overhang of the 1980's exacerbated these financial problems and worsened debt service coverage&quot; in developing countries, according to the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This militates against developing countries footing the maintenance and development bills. So to bail them out, other methods are needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robinson Mwanza, chief executive officer of the &quot;commercialised&quot; Zambian Electricity Supply Company (Zesco), told the Midrand conference that &quot;Zambia had to reform as a matter of survival. There was no alternative to reform since the infrastructure had collapsed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Case studies in Africa and elsewhere were cited, indicating the changes that have been wrought to counter the downward slide. These ranged from outright selling off of state assets to hiving off non-core activities to the private sector. Or letting Independent Power Producers (IPPs) come on the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank estimates that US$100-billion is required yearly to meet &quot;modest rates of growth&quot; of the power sector in developing countries. The bank and other official lenders --- multilateral banks, bilateral donors and export credit agencies --- &quot;cannot realistically provide more than 10 percent&quot; of this amount. Only US$1,7-billion is available for sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is against this background that the bank recommends that the private sector should step in. But there should be the necessary domestic commitment (to democratisation) and a good measure of flexibility and pragmatism on the part of outside partners --- perhaps to take cognisance of the very imperfect economic and political conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the bank warns against imposing general measures and makes a point of treating each national economy distinctly, its guidelines include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The need for governments to rethink their roles in power supplies.  Policy making, regulatory and ownership functions should be considered separately &quot;provided their links are clarified.&quot; Public ownership of utilities is not, however, ruled out as &quot;public or private ownership alone is an insufficient basis for predicting the success or failure of power sector reforms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Commercialisation, viewed as a &quot;series of measures that lead a State-owned enterprise to conform to corporate standards of management and operations, including efficiency in pricing&quot;, is a goal for sector reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other economic indicators --- like inflation --- should be considered as &quot;tariff reform and inflation are of special concern in devising realistic procedures and schedules&quot; in restructuring. General affordability, including subsidies, are crucial policy considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Introducing competition in the sector is a more complex phenomenon.  &quot;It could range from bidding for ancillary to core services&quot;. However, &quot;any efficiency gains from introducing competitive supply will have to be measured against new transaction costs, more complex regulation and possible inefficiency in investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank recommends that where feasible there should be encouragement of bidding for &quot;financing and construction of additional capacity&quot; (IPPs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank is hopeful that there is greater &quot;co- operation among public , private and international participants in power sector development than is often expected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Policies should be based on general understanding and consent; efforts should be made to open the policy-making process and to the understanding of the public; and for the parties involved to tailor reforms while being sensitive to an understanding of local economic and political conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deliberations on power sector reforms seem to have eschewed the wholesale market approach that marked much of the thinking on restructuring the economies of the Third World. Certainly the realities of the power sector and distinct national economies have been as much of a concern.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Although the Comoros Islands have reopened for South African holiday-makers in the wake of Bob Denard's abortive coup in October, the &quot;Perfume Isles&quot; are still being battered by other political storms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political leaders on Moheli Island, one of the largest in the Comoros complex, last weekend announced they no longer recognise two &quot;governments&quot; that are currently fighting to rule the archipelago in the wake of Denard's putsch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Indian Ocean Newsletter reports from Paris that an interim administration set up by Prime Minister Mohamed Caabi El Yachroutu after the coup is now being challenged by a &quot;counter- administration&quot; set up with Said Ali Mohamed as a rival prime minister.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Moheli islanders, disgruntled with the state of confusion, are reported to have called for a campaign of civil disobedience, chased the Moroni-appointed governor off the isle, and set up a citizens' committee to run their administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A petition has been circulated on neighbouring Anjouan Island calling for secession from the Comoros Islands and reunion with France as an overseas territory --- as is the case with Mayotte Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The petition is based on a popular perception that ruling elites on the island of Grande Comoros have imposed a form of political and economic hegemony over the archipelago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the capital Moroni continues to be torn by the two rival administrations, each claiming to be legal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government rivals &quot;obeyed a call from local bigwigs to organise a political meeting on November 20 calling for the El Yachroutu government to resign. The meeting scheduled in the capital's main square was banned by the government,&quot; says the latest edition of the Indian Ocean Newsletter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The volatile political climate has raised doubts about plans to hold a presidential election on the islands in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World Leisure Holidays, a tour company which operates hotels in the Comoros, was unavailable for comment on whether the latest developments on the islands would affect tourists.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 8, 1995<BR>by Gaye Davis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela has cited a $10- million donation from the Republic of China on Taiwan for the African National Congress' general election campaign as one reason South Africa would not break ties with the island republic in favour of diplomatic relations with mainland China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela disclosed details of the R35-million grant while responding to questions after briefing political scientists last Tuesday on the pending trial of former defence minister Magnus Malan and 10 former colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disclosure is certain to set a cat among the pigeons in diplomatic dovecotes. Cash-rich Taiwan has been intensively lobbying for the retention of diplomatic ties with South Africa and is pumping millions into the economy: this week it finalised an agreement to spend R141- million on a vocational training centre for demobilised SANDF soldiers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Big business, however, sees recognition of China --- with its 1,2-billion people and fast-growing economy --- as essential despite its atrocious human rights record. As China refuses to recognise Taiwan, this would mean South Africa having to downgrade its links with Taiwan and face possible economic consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the disclosure has also deepened concerns about South Africa's foreign policy-making, currently under heightened scrutiny after its failure in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela told the gathering the money was given as &quot;a donation and not a bribe&quot; after he requested assistance and that the ANC would not repay a friend's favours by &quot;stabbing them in the back&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rumours that Mandela had secured the funds surfaced when he visited Taipei in July 1993. A joint statement by the ANC and the Taiwanese government at the time denied any such request had been made. This week the Taiwanese ambassador to South Africa, I-Cheng Loh, was still insisting no donation had been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana confirmed the grant, saying the amount was a &quot;one-off&quot; --- and added that the Taiwanese government was providing &quot;assistance&quot; to various sections of the ANC and was &quot;fully sponsoring&quot; an ANC Youth League bursary programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are reasons to be friends with Taiwan, but this aid would not influence our foreign policy decisions,&quot; Mankahlana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democratic Party leader Tony Leon would not agree. He said this week he had learned while visiting Taiwan in December 1994 that Mandela's request for funds, made directly to Taiwanese president Lee Teng Hui, had been granted &quot;within minutes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our whole foreign policy is based on the electoral debts of the ANC,&quot; Leon said. &quot;When the ANC is short of cash it runs off to the Gulf states or to Morocco for help. There is a porous wall between party and state in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is something wrong and imminently corruptible about governments donating funds to political parties. In our view, our foreign policy is largely available for hire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you make a substantial donation to the ANC you get special foreign policy considerations --- whether or not these are in our country's best interests or in keeping with the international posture South Africa is trying to keep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is flawed, short-sighted and should be corrected by legislation.&quot; Leon said if the issue was not addressed by Parliament's ethics committee --- currently focusing on the extent to which members should be required to disclose their financial interests --- the DP would consider bringing private members' legislation &quot;on the question of foreign governments and political parties donating money to South African political parties&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mankahlana said: &quot;We are writing a new constitution and will look at all these questions. The situation is not helped by people jumping up and down making noises intended to score cheap political points.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Sara Pienaar, national director of the Institute for International Affairs, said: &quot;Quite obviously Taiwan was buying favours for the future --- and it does look from the Taiwanese point of view as if it has worked. It is not a very healthy phenomenon. Foreign governments should not be funding our political parties --- but circumstances last year were very peculiar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC had an election campaign to fight and its old friends were not in a position to help, Pienaar said. &quot;But there should be a policy that political parties do not receive any funds from any foreign government and that if any grants are received, they should be made public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela would be able to wield &quot;considerable influence&quot; over any foreign policy matter, Pienaar said. &quot;There is no doubt that important foreign policy decisions in this country are made by the president himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Taiwan's past human rights record is not spotless, it has spent the past 10 years democratising. Mandela told the political scientists it had done nothing to deserve de- recognition: it was simply that China desired this. South Africa saw the issue as a domestic Chinese problem. It wanted to recognise both Chinas and had told the People's Republic of China so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the funding raises inevitable questions about the ANC's links with other countries. In its pre-election foreign policy manifesto, the organisation committed itself to &quot;canonise human rights&quot; in its foreign relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In May, after he had come under fire for twice visiting Indonesia --- internationally condemned and shunned by the ANC for years for its brutal occupation of East Timor --- Mandela revealed the ANC had received substantial donations from that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strong rumours have been circulating about whether Moroccan funds for the ANC have anything to do with South Africa failing to carry out its promise of diplomatic recognition for Africa's last colony --- the Polisario-led Saharawi Republic, struggling for independence from Moroccan control. Questions have also been asked about whether South Africa's disastrous softly-softly approach towards Nigeria was not perhaps founded in financial backing the ANC received from previous rulers of the oil-rich country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign affairs ministry spokesman Pieter Swanepoel said any decision on the two Chinas would be made by Parliament. &quot;It will be a political decision, up to the political parties to decide,&quot; he said. &quot;Foreign Affairs will have to execute it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC MP Raymond Suttner, chair of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Portfolio Committee, said he had no personal knowledge of any donations to the ANC. The question of recognising China was &quot;under discussion in ANC ranks and has still to be decided by the collective leadership&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Leon: &quot;I'm not saying the Taiwanese have no case. But in my view the continued diplomatic recognition of the ROC is based not on the merits but the fact that they paid off the ANC. The DP had yet to formulate a position on the question of the two Chinas, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC representative Ronnie Mamoepa this week failed to respond to a Mail &amp; Guardian request that the ANC provide information about donations it had received from foreign governments. ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa, contacted for comment, said: &quot;We have received donations from a number of countries, but I do not have the details at hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called for sanctions against Nigeria in the wake of the November 10 execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists from the Ogoni minority last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking here on before attending the official memorial tribute in London to the writer and human rights campaigner and eight other Ogoni activists hanged by General Sani Abacha's military junta, Archbishop Tutu called for an oil embargo against Nigeria and for the accounts of the military rulers to be closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Apartheid was brought down to its knees by the support for sanctions.  Therefore we could call on the international community to continue that good work,&quot; declared Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize winner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu also gave support to an international boycott of Shell Oil Company, saying he believed that Shell should be encouraged to bring pressure on General Abacha's government by pulling out of gas projects there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But if they refused, then yes. I would myself be inclined to call for a boycott of Shell worldwide,&quot; Tutu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu, who is also president of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) and a close friend of South African President Nelson Mandela, said Mandela's initial &quot;softly, softly&quot; approach towards Nigeria was hardening, and warned; &quot;He has got the bit between his teeth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu said he also hoped the British government would eventually impose sanctions, adding: &quot;I hope that John Major (British Prime Minister) will take a moral stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu was supported by former Anglican peace envoy and hostage in Lebanon Terry Waite, who said he had seen the effectiveness of sanctions in South Africa and insisted that ordinary people would be behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Waite also spoke about the fate of Saro-Wiwa before he attended the tribute evening, saying; &quot;I myself have lived under a death sentence and I know there are many people in Nigeria now who are living under that threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa's brother, Owen Wiwa, 39, who demonstrated last week outside Shell's London offices, also addressed the audience of 900 sympathisers who attended Sunday's memorial performance at the Theatre Royal in Haymarket, speaking of the &quot;insensitivity&quot; of Shell and the worsening conditions for the Ogoni people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My mother-in-law was arrested for wearing black to mourn her own son.  Ken's death devastated our people and we are not allowed to mourn,&quot; Owen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu's call came only a day before Mandela renewed his call for sanctions against Nigeria to be intensified during a meeting in Johannesburg with Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Emeka Anyaoku, himself a Nigerian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The lack of response (to calls for Nigeria to restore democracy) means that we should intensify demands for the application of sanctions, especially oil sanctions, against Nigeria,&quot; Mandela said after talks with Anyaoku. Their meeting followed the November Commonwealth Heads of Government Summit in Auckland last month at which Nigeria was suspended from the world body following the executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talks came ahead of the third meeting on December 20 and 21 of the Commonwealth's eight-nation sub- committee on Nigeria comprising eight foreign ministers, including South Africa's Alfred Nzo. The meeting would map out further action against Nigeria if it failed to embark on political and human rights reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talks also came as the European Union foreign ministers were agreeing to place a sports boycott on Nigeria and to withdraw all military attaches from the country in a bid to step up pressure on the regime over its human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move, announced by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, followed last month's agreement to impose an embargo on arms sales to Nigeria and a ban on issuing of visas for members of the junta. They also decided to withdraw visas issued before last month's ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials said the sports boycott was principally aimed at persuading the world governing body, Federation of International Football Associations (FIFA), not to award Nigeria the 1996 World Youth Championships.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accra - At least eight people were injured in clashes between Muslims and Christians in Ghana's second city, police on the scene said on December 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incident, which took place on November 29 in Kumasi, 200 kilometres northwest of the capital, Accra, was sparked off when Muslim youths destroyed speakers and other sound equipment used by Christian evangelists, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite warning shots fired by police, the clash escalated after Christians responded by destroying stalls owned by Muslim traders at the city's market and several people were injured when missiles were thrown by the two warring groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are on full alert, but tension is still latent,&quot; a policeman reached by telephone in Kumasi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tension between Muslims and Christians in Ghana has been running high this year, largely as a result of the zeal of those newly converted from one faith to the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it was the second time violent clashes have erupted between Muslims and Christians in Kumasi this year, the first having occurred on February 23, during which at least eight people were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The earlier clashes, which were reported in the February 28 edition of the government-owned Daily Graphic, had said that the violence broke out when Muslim radicals in the mainly Muslim community of Old Suame stormed a Methodist church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the paper, about 50 people armed with sticks and stones had attacked the church and beat up members of the congregation, after alleging that a guest preacher had insulted the Muslim Holy Book, the Koran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attackers then went on to destroy musical instruments and electrical appliances in the church and threatened to burn down the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack had followed other religious clashes in the town of Wenchi, 310 kilometres northwest of Accra on the evening of February 7 in which several people were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The February 7 clashes involved orthodox and reformist Muslims arguing about religious practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana's population of some 15 million people comprises 50 per cent Christians, 35 per cent traditionalists, 10 per cent Muslims, while the remaining five per cent practise other beliefs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>December 4, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Rwanda has ordered UN peacekeeping troops stationed in the country to leave the central African country or face expulsion by the local population, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu announced on November 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with the Ethiopian daily, Herald, during a stopover in the capital Addis Ababa en route to a five-nation international summit on the Rwandan refugee crisis and the ethnic strife threatening the Great Lakes region, which includes Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire and Uganda, Bizimungu said that UN troops and military observers who do not leave the country would be considered an &quot;occupation force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Rwandan government is perfectly capable of ensuring the country's internal security and safeguarding its sovereignty without an outside military presence,&quot; Bizimungu was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In New York, a source said the UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros- Ghali was preparing to recommend a phased withdrawal of the last 2,000 peacekeepers from the central African country, following the request of the Rwandan government. UNAMIR's mandate is due to lapse on , and by the time of going to press officials had not asked for it to be renewed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN sources say Boutros-Ghali will ask the Security Council to approve a phased pullout of the last remaining 2,000 peacekeepers in the force, which numbered 5,500 troops at one point. Some diplomats said, however, that some council members favoured keeping troops in the country-engulfed by the ethnic bloodbath between Hutus and Tutsis last year during which Hutu extremists killed between 500,000 and one million people, most of them Tutsis and moderate Hutus - so long as the massive refugee problem, among others, remained unresolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The secretariat studied in recent weeks whether a continued military presence in Rwanda might be negotiated with local authorities. The central government, however, made known on November 24, through Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana, that it wanted UNAMIR forces to leave. Western sources also fear that UNAMIR pullout will create difficulties for other agencies, notably those involved in monitoring human rights in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move by the Rwandan government to force out UN peacekeepers comes as an international war crimes tribunal began work on November 27 in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha. Court clerk Andronico Adede said by telephone from Arusha, where the tribunal sits, that South African judge Navanethem Pillay had arrived and begun studying the first indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was prepared by tribunal's prosecutor, South African judge Richard Goldstone, who said the previous week he would announce on December 12 the names of those singled out in the first indictment, and that the first trial could begin up to eight weeks afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tribunal was created by the UN Security Council in November 1994 to try people accused of war crimes during the ethnic bloodbath that engulfed Rwanda in 1994, following the shooting down on April 6 of a plane carrying Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira, both Hutus who died in the resulting crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goldstone, said he signed &quot;one indictment for a number of accused suspects,&quot; but the indictment must still be confirmed by a tribunal judge.  The Rwandan government has drawn up a list of 463 genocide suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tribunal clerk Andronico Adede told a press conference held jointly with Goldstone that the tribunal would effectively begin work in Arusha on .  The first of the tribunal judges will arrive in Arusha at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goldstone met Rwandan judicial authorities on November 24 after visiting the Zambian capital, Lusaka, to examine the case of 18 Rwandan genocide suspects being held there. The tribunal may yet charge six of them, whom he has asked the Zambians to hold. Belgium has arrested six suspected organisers of the massacre, Canada two and Switzerland one, and many more are being hunted in various countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a separate development, former Rwandan premier Faustin Twagiramungu charged in a communique obtained late November in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, that the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) army had &quot;massacred more than 250,000 people&quot; in a second wave of genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twagiramungu, a moderate Hutu who left the government in August, had earlier claimed in a Canadian newspaper that the Hutus died in &quot;revenge killings&quot; by the RFP and that in 16 months, it had &quot;done worse than the assassinated president Juvenal Habyariamana did in 20 years of power. As for massacres of more than 250,000 people, we have irrefutable proof backing up our claims, and challenge anyone who claims the contrary to agree to an independent international inquiry to be launched into these crimes,&quot; said the former premier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Calling on the international community to stop all aid &quot;which supports the Rwandan government in its criminal work,&quot; Twagiramungu said the crimes committed in the Habyarimana regime, the massacres and genocide which he prepared, no matter how monstrous they were, can in no way justify or excuse those attributed to the RPF.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Kenyan capital, dozens of Rwandans were arrested in the last week of November and between 25 and 100 were still being held in police stations by November 28, an official of the main Hutu refugee organisation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> @t least 3,000 Rwandans, mostly Hutus, fled their country to Kenya since rebels of a Tutsi-led front seized power after a bloody civil war last year, ousting a Hutu regime and troops and militias accused of genocide against minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kenyan government said in a statement that 'although some bona fide refugees have conducted themselves well, it has now become quite clear that there are a number of foreigners who pose as 'refugees' with neither proper documentation nor being in recognised refugee camps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government installed in Kigali by the former rebels accuses Kenya of harbouring several leaders of the genocide. These are believed to include Habyarimana's widow and family, as well as Felicien Kabuga, the former financial backer of the Radio Milles Collines, the radio said to have urged Hutu extremists to exterminate Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenyan opposition leader Kenneth Matiba told journalists on November 29 that Madame Habyarimana had left the country three weeks earlier for Zaire to check certain discussion her late husband held with authorities in Zaire, but she would return. Matiba, leader of the opposition Forum for the Restoration of Democracy Asili (Original - FORD-A) party, said he was taking care of the family of Habyarimana, a personal friend and would do so &quot;for ever if needs arose&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international community was currently also making frantic efforts to help find a solution to the long-standing ethnic conflict in the Great Lakes region of central Africa. In a five-nation summit convened in the Egyptian capital since November 28, by former US president Jimmy Carter, African leaders vowed to tackle the Rwandan refugee crisis on the ethnic strife threatening the Great Lakes region of Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everyone agrees that hundreds of thousands of refugees should come back home and to reconciliation with their neighbours,&quot; the former US president who is also chairman of the summit, said in his opening address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Cross-border raids should stop, smuggling arms to small groups should stop and committing genocides should stop. Reconciliation should prevail,&quot; Carter added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former US president expressed his hope of repeating with the African countries the success of the Egypt-Israeli Camp David accords which he presided over in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu recalled that it was &quot;not the first time that Rwanda had a problem of refugees. It has existed since 1959 and has been an influence on neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In 1990 there were almost two million refugees outside the country, and my government is committed to helping all refugees to come back under equal conditions,&quot; despite the barring of some of the two million ethnic Hutu refugees living in Zaire and the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) from attending the Cairo summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among those present as mediators were South African Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu told the summit that he had &quot;never been so proud to be African as I am this time because the initiative for this meeting is an African initiative. The Heads of State have shown by their presence here their commitment to reach an African solution for African problems,&quot; Tutu who is the president of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zairean president Mobutu vowed to &quot;work to make this conference a success for the world community watching us. My presence here shows that we are going to find solutions to all these problems&lt;' Mobutu pledged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tanzania, which held general elections last month is represented at the summit by the outgoing State Minister for Defence Abdel Rahman Kinana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than a million Rwandans fled the small central African nation last year during an after the bloody civil war. Extremist Hutus are accused of the genocide and of causing unrest in exile and intimidating their mainly Hutu fellow-refugees into not returning to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zairean government has announced plans to make all Rwandans living in the Lake Goma border region return home by the end of the year, but Mobutu said in Cairo that he opposed the use of force.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Kenya's opposition Members of Parliament on November 30 launched a new initiative, The Opposition Alliance, whose main purpose is to field a single presidential contender to facePresident Daniel arap Moi in the next general elections in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea of an alliance has been discussed since the contentious multiparty elections of 1992 but has often beem met with varied disagreements from leaders of the main opposition parties in Kenya namely the Democratic Party (DP), Forum for the Restoration of Democracy-Kenya (FORD-K), FORD-Asili (Original) and other smaller ones.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The announcement of the opposition alliance presents a reckoning force for President Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1992 presidential poll, Moi received 1,820,872 votes against a combined opposition total of 3,439,967 votes. KANU won a larger number of seats in parliament - 100 compared to 88 for the opposition. At least 12 MPs from the opposition later defected to KANU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Underscoring, the imperative for unity during the launching of the alliance, MP James Orengo, the Vice Chairman of Ford-Kenya said the lessons of the 1992 debacle should have been learnt by now.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>December 4, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Hague - An international Catholic peace organisation here, has launched investigations into the alleged arms deal between the South African and Sudanese governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a message to the New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC), which serves churches in the liberated areas in southern Sudan, Mr. Jan Gruiters, Secretary for African Affairs of Pax Christi says, &quot;our concern over the issue was as a result of a letter, written to us by the Justice and Peace department of the South African Catholic Bishops' Conference (SACBC)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their letter dated November 16, the Catholic bishops have expressed concern about alleged shipments of arms to conflict areas like Burundi, Rwanda and Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Gruiters, adds; &quot;In its letter, the SACBC has referred to rumours indicating that arms were reaching these countries through third countries, possibly France and Seychelles.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The communication between Pax Christi and the NSCC is aimed at gathering more information regarding the issue for the Catholic peace organisation to realise its investigation goal, says Gruiters in his message to NSCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the message, Gruiters a renowned personality in matters concerning human rights, disarmaments and reconciliation through Pax Christi, quotes the South African Bishops saying; &quot;In meetings with representatives of Armscor, the South African arms manufacturer stated that it cannot be expected to know if a purchasing country is not honouring the contract conditions, which would state that no South African arms may be sold to a third country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pax Christi, says it is concerned about the rapprochement between Sudan and South Africa as the move has political, commercial as well as military connotations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the significance of this relationship should not be over- estimated the rapprochement between democratic South Africa and Sudan, notorious for its flagrant violation of human rights and on- going civil war is startling, observes Pax Christi. And adds; &quot;This is particularly true for those Sudanese who hoped for firm South African support in their struggle for a just and lasting solution of the civil war or at least some empathy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic peace movement also lamented its futile attempts to get information from South African embassies in both Nairobi and the Hague regarding the government's foreign policy guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to Pax Christi, the NSCC in the statement signed by the organisation's Communication/Interpretation Coordinator Mr. Soforonio Efuk, states; &quot;With this letter, we would therefore, like on behalf of the suffering population in Sudan, to draw President Mandela's attention to the consequences of South Africa's arms shipment and the presence of that country's mercenaries to the embattled Sudanese people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are saddened and grieved about the rapprochement between South African companies and the hard-line Islamic government in Khartoum. This growing military co-operation is not only incompatible with South Africa's foreign policy but also contradictory to President Mandela's recent stand on Nigeria's human rights violations as well as his status as one of Africa's most respected leaders,&quot; added the NSCC statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a spokesman at the South African High Commission in the Kenyan capital denied ever having been contacted by Pax Christi as the latter claims in its message to the NSCC. He told APS that matters regarding Sudan were handled by their embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a spokesman for the Sudan Embassy in Nairobi denied his country's involvement in the arms deal with South Africa. &quot;Those are calculated moves by international human rights bodies to damage the good name of Sudan on the national, regional and international levels,&quot; he told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said the only business deal he knew of between his country and South Africa was Sudan's purchasing of train coaches from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the French authorities claimed that in April 1994, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) received sophisticated weaponry made in China, Israel and South Africa, including South African made ground-to-air missiles, Pax Christi said in the message to NSCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is not clear whether the South African made weapons were delivered recently and/or directly to the conflict parties in the Sudan. It is also difficult to present substantial evidence that countries like France and the Seychelles have either re-exported South African military goods or acted as transit ports, Pax Christi observes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Armscor's position that it cannot be expected to know if a country is not honouring the sale conditions which would prohibit that South African arms are sold to a third party, is far from the accountability one may expect, notes the Catholic body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to sources within the NSCC, Gruiters, is scheduled to visit South Africa early next year regarding the alleged sale of arms by the South African government to the Islamic government in Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While there, Gruiters is expected to confer with the South African authorities including President Nelson Mandela and church leaders, among them Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the NSCC source told APS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mchinji, Malawi - Although Malawian women are standing against anything seen as an obstacle to their rights, they charge that police and judiciary are &quot;not doing enough&quot; to bring to book all those who harass women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As numerous workshops, seminars and conferences on gender equality awareness continue at all levels of the society in Malawi with the aim of enlightening women about their rights , more women (85 per cent of whom are illiterate) are now coming out in the open to speak against women abuse, condemning police and judiciary for not doing enough to bring to book rapists and all those who harass women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Director of Public Prosecution, Kamudoni Nyasulu, however says the activists' concerns are misdirected because the judiciary is at the end of most cases that are brought before courts. The re- enforcement of the law against women abuse is generally inadequate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In any case, even if courts may pass judgement in favour of a woman, relatives may reverse the court's decision by influencing the woman,&quot; Nyasulu contended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But police say that one of the solutions to the fight against sexual offence and domestic violence is civic education. &quot;Aggressive awareness campaigns is a must and there is need to establish rape crisis centres, incest, abuse and sexual offence support groups that will provide education, counselling and support for victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Latest statistics show that five in every 50 women are battered everyday in Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this connection, police were quick to say that the majority of the women are economically dependent on the husband. It is this setting that allows the battered wives to bear their suffering in silence. The women who report incidents of beatings do so at the &quot;heat of the moment' but withdraw later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only are many women ignorant of the laws that protect them but it is also a widely held belief that if a woman reports on offence of domestic violence to police or goes to court, her action is interpreted to mean that she wants a divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &gt;From January to July 1995, 211 rape cases were reported throughout Malawi as compared to 87 during the same period in 1994. The low figures are attributed to under reporting. Consequently, to encourage more victims to report cases to police, plans are underway to build private interview rooms at all police stations that will promote confidentiality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, representatives of the Women Activists' Groups here lobbying for the advocacy of gender sensitive policy have proposed a number of issues to the Malawi Government. These include changing the socio-economic and political structures in the country so that these should reflect gender balance, and legalising the elimination of sexual harassment by giving this form of abuse a statutory definition which does not currently exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other concerns raised include imposing a statutory duty on employers to take steps to eliminate sexual harassment, and provision of civil remedy to victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women working in shops, restaurants and small companies should be entitled to three months maternity leave to enable them take care of their babies, the activists' group proposed. They also called for the establishment of creches or day-care centres for breast-feeding mothers, at work places.  Ideally, the centres will be situated where mother would leave their babies as they go about their duties in the offices and breast feed them when they take some time off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Changes at this level will have strategic benefits not only for women but for men as well in terms of the development process,&quot; argue the activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much as the Malawi Constitution guarantees equality, there is lack of specific legislation to protect women on a particular issue. It remains to be seen therefore whether the women's fight for gender sensitivity will be maintained and achieve the goals set out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria - Archbishop Desmond Tutu was on November 29 appointed to head South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a body being set up to probe human rights abuses during the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu, the Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town and 1984 Nobel peace laureate, was appointed to the post by the Cabinet, said Jakes Gerwel, the director general of President Nelson Mandela's office. The cabinet also named the other 16 members of the commission, which will begin hearings at the beginning of 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The body, which Gerwel said would begin work immediately, will investigate all politically motivated crimes committed by members and allies of the former regime in defence of apartheid, as well as those committed by members of the liberation movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the commissions's three sub-committees will have the power to grant amnesty and indemnity from prosecution to the perpetrators of such acts in exchange for full disclosure of their crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another committee will give out reparations to the victims and families of those killed, injured, or who lost property during the racial struggle since 1948. Gerwel said the cabinet's decision last week on the appointments &quot;marks an important stage in this historic process of coming to an understanding of our past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The process is aimed at reconciliation and reconstruction of this once deeply divided and conflict ridden society, now in pursuit of a future founded on the recognition of human rights, democracy and peaceful co-existence of all its citizens,&quot; Gerwel added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The multiparty cabinet led by President Nelson Mandela's National African Congress (ANC) expressed the view that the commission's work was directed by the need for understanding but not for vengeance, the need for reparation but not for retaliation, Gerwel noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The appointments were made by Mandela in consultation with the Cabinet from a short list drawn up by an independent selection panel after interviews with 46 nominees. Gerwel said the cabinet discussions were held in a &quot;spirit of consensus seeking and without acrimony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was despite the fact that the cabinet also comprised members of the former ruling National Party (NP) and the nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), some of whose members are likely to appear in front of the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former liberal politician Alex Boraine, who is now the executive director of the non-governmental organisation, Justice in Transition, was appointed deputy chairman of the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There appears to be only one overt right-winger on the commission, advocate Chris de Jager, a member of the statutory Volkstaat Council which is seeking an autonomous white state in South Africa. A former Member of Parliament of the NP who later became involved with white liberal politics, Wynand Malan, is also on the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other members include Mary Burton, former national president of the anti-apartheid women's movement, the Black Sash, and human rights lawyers Richard Lystr, Fifi Kamphephe, Dumisa Ntsebeza and Denzil Potjieter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also appointed were academic Wendy Orr, who mounted a successful campaign against the apartheid police to stop them assaulting prisoners, medical researcher Matule Ramashala and Faizel Randera, a doctor who investigated the suspected poisoning by the former government of church leader Frank Chikane in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also in the team are Yasmin Sooka, national president of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, Hlengiwe Mkhize, national director of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, Glenda Wildschut, social worker who has counselled victims of political violence, Bongani Finca, the interim administrator of the black homeland of Ciskei after the military rule collapsed there in 1994, and Khoza Mgojo, Methodist cleric from KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Church of Uganda Archbishop Livingstone Nkoyoyo has blamed Ugandan men for the rising cases of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) scourge in this East African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkoyoyo who was speaking during a confirmation ceremony at Bukoto Church of Uganda in the capital Kampala on November 26, accused Ugandan men of behaving &quot;like a vehicle which has bad alignment. It knocks in every direction.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You men are vulnerable to loose sex since you move in all directions<BR>... Stop indulging in loose sex,&quot; the Anglican Archbishop said amid applause from the hundreds of women amongst men who attended the ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The manager of Uganda AIDS Control Programme (UACP) Dr. Elizabeth Madraa, says the HIV virus which often causes AIDS is spreading more rapidly amongst women in the country's rural areas. Statistics in Uganda from the AIDS Control programme show that of the 41,559 regular AIDS cases 19,638 (47.8 per cent) are men and 21,921 (52.7 per cent) are women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Madraa attributed the high incidence of AIDS infection among women in Uganda to wide spread rape, defilement and commercial sex, especially amongst the rural poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many times (Ugandan) women find themselves dependent on men financially. This reduces their bargaining power for protected sex. When a man says no to a condom the woman has no choice,&quot; she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Madraa further said that most of the infected Ugandan women are married. She attributed this to culture in most parts of the country. &quot;Women are expected to get married so that even if their husbands are unfaithful and demand unprotected sex the women who are more (in numbers) than men will agree than lose marital status and be stigmatised by society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Madraa called for awareness campaigns to be concentrated amongst rural women and girls. She also appealed to non-governmental organisations operating in Uganda to increase their efforts in providing village women and girls with income generating projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The underlying factor of women's lack of negotiating power and skills is that Ugandan women generally lack a sense of identity. They spend all their lives under the authority of men. From their fathers to their husbands.... this stems from dependency,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Africa's two most powerful nations, Nigeria and South Africa, are bracing for a major confrontation emanating form the execution by Nigeria's hardline military junta of nine Ogoni minority rights activists, including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On November 26, South African President Nelson Mandela launched a scathing attack on Nigerian military strongman General Sani Abacha, describing his dictatorship as &quot;barbaric, corrupt, irresponsible and arrogant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview published in Johannesburg's Sunday Independent newspaper, Mandela also revealed that he had warned South African officials of Anglo-Dutch Shell Oil company that action would be taken against them because of Shell's refusal to halt a gas project in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Abacha is sitting on a volcano and I am going to explode it under him,&quot; Mandela told the newspaper. The South African President said the executions had hardened his stance against Abacha, whom he had, until then, been trying through diplomatic means to persuade to restore democracy to Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I felt we were dealing with an insensitive, frightened dictator and in my view we should use the strongest methods to show our disgust and resentment of what he has done. What we are now proposing are short and sharp measures which will produce the results Nigerians and the world desire,&quot; Mandela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the President expressed disappointment at the lack of effective internal resistance against Nigeria's military rulers, saying the pace and outcome of international campaigns will depend on Nigerians themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is of no use for Nigerian leaders to shout from abroad and not to ensure that the fires of resistance are burning inside Nigeria,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela has been lobbying world leaders, among them US President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major, to impose an oil embargo and other economic sanctions on Nigeria &quot;to bring Abacha to his knees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On November 20, Mandela asked Shell to shelve its Sterling pounds 2.5 billion (US dollars 3.9 billion) gas project in the oil-rich West African country, but received what an aide described as a &quot;deeply disappointing&quot; response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela said he had also taken a hard line with the Shell officials. &quot;I told them that I expect them to suspend the project which they have launched in Nigeria ... as a mark of protest,&quot; and when they hesitated to do so, I warned them that we are going to take action against them in this country, because we can't allow people to think in terms of their gains when the very lives of human beings are involved,&quot; but did not elaborate on the action to be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela's angry interview against Nigeria's military regime followed similar criticism against him by Abacha in the Nigerian press three days earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public castigation of Mandela in Nigeria reached a peak on November 23 when Nigerian Head of State, General Sani Abacha, openly attacked the South African leader saying his long years in prison may have left him incapable of understanding the complexity of modern diplomacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Possibly, it may not be his fault. Probably because.. of being incarcerated for 27 years, he cannot understand the complexity of modern diplomacy,&quot; General Abacha told a delegation of traditional Nigerian leaders from across the country, who went to the political capital Abuja to demonstrate their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha said it was unfortunate that South Africa and Zimbabwe, two southern African countries which Nigeria had helped in their struggle for independence, were leading the lobby for sanctions against Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I cannot understand, neither can I appreciate any reason why people like Mandela and (Zimbabwean President) Mugabe are behaving the way they did.  These were the same people for whom we have made a lot of sacrifices in order to ensure freedom in their own countries,&quot; Abacha was quoted saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think there is a need for us to review our foreign policy in order to reconsider our priorities,&quot; he added in what was interpreted by analysts here as indicating that Nigeria might shift the focus away from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until now, the Nigerian government has always insisted that Africa is at the centre of its foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers said the present face-off seemed to be the culmination of mutual suspicion between the two countries since Mandela came to power last year after the dismantling of apartheid..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Top officials from both countries, Africa's most influential, have in the past year reiterated that the two nations were not in competition over leadership of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Nigeria's national television reported a week earlier that South Africa's campaign for sanctions against Nigeria was aimed at facilitating Pretoria's entry into the UN Security Council as Africa's representative if and when the body was enlarged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Nigeria, Mandela's current posture may have been interpreted as a challenge to its traditional stand as the most powerful and influential nation on the African continent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>December 4, 1995<BR>by Goodson Machona</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - Zimbabwe's Catholic Bishops Conference (ZCBC) has warned it may reconsider partnership with the government at some hospitals following a drastic cut in the Ministry of Health budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government announced late November that Zimbabwe dollars 1.37 billion (US dollars 148 million) allocated to the Ministry of Health in the financial year that began last July would be cut to about US dollars 110 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health Minister Timothy Stamps says to work optimally, his ministry needs at least US dollars 200 million per annum.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Stamps recently auctioned his cut hair sold to a German expatriate for about US dollars 40, to dramatise the need for funds to support efforts to stop the spread of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Health Minister said AIDS would kill some 100,000 Zimbabweans in<BR>the next 18 months. In addition, the government has to deal with a host of other common diseases like malaria which afflicted 300,000 Zimbabweans last year, killing 290 of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors to reduce State spending but the Catholic Bishops questioned the priorities, saying cutting spending in health was counter productive and would hit the most vulnerable in society. &quot;We question the priorities which the government has set itself in the current budget,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The announcement of the cuts and the Bishops' letter coincide with the contradictory announcement that effective next July, President Robert Mugabe's annual salary package would rise by more than 100 per cent from Zimbabwe dollars 195,000 to 456,000 (approximately US dollars 21,000 to 50,000). There would be matching increases in salary for the two Vice Presidents, members of the Cabinet and Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic Bishops asserted that by targeting the public health budget, the government was effectively abandoning the rural poor Zimbabwe where serious drought in the past year had severely curtailed incomes in peasant holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this year during the United Nations World Conference on Poverty in Copenhagen, Denmark, British aid agency, Oxfam, said many peasant mothers in Zimbabwe had abandoned ante-and post-natal clinics because they could not afford the meagre fees required of them in contributory health schemes recently introduced in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cairo - Rwanda will request a three-month extension of the United Nations mandate in the troubled central African country, former US President Jimmy Carter and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu said at a five-nation international summit here aimed at resolving the Rwandan refugee crisis and the ethnic strife threatening the Great Lakes region of central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carter, whose peace centre is sponsoring the conference on Rwanda's<BR>refugee crisis, told a press conference that he had asked the Rwandan government to request an extension and that President Bizimungu had agreed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bizimungu confirmed that he would ask for the extension for the current mandate, which expires on .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference brought together leaders of Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire, while Tanzania, which held its last leg of general elections last week, was represented by its minister of state for defence Abdel Rahaman Kinana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On November 27, Bizimungu had ordered the UN peacekeeping troops stationed in Rwanda to leave or face expulsion by the local population, an order that had forced UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali start preparations to phase out the UN Military Assistance in Rwanda (UNAMIR) peacekeepers from the war-torn tiny central African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources at the UN headquarters in New York said Boutros-Ghali was at the point of asking the UN Security Council to approve a phased pullout of the last remaining 2,000 peacekeepers in the force, which numbered 5,500 troops at their peak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, some diplomats at the UN Security Council favoured keeping the UN blue-helmets in Rwanda - engulfed by ethnic bloodbath between Hutus and Tutsis last year during which Hutu extremists killed between 500,000 million people, most of the Tutsis and moderate Hutus - as long as the massive refugee problem, among others, remained unresolved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>December 4, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brussels - As francophone leaders gathered in Cotonou, Benin, at the weekend for their annual summit, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire hinted that he would use the occasion to seek renewal of diplomatic ties with former colonial power, Belgium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged that Belgium and Zaire should put their differences behind<BR>them and begin talks on restoring relations. President Mobutu told<BR>Belgian television that the 47-nation francophone summit, which was<BR>expected to begin in the Benin capital on December 2, could provide<BR>an opportunity for him to meet Belgium Prime Minister Jean-Luc<BR>Dehaene.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last one and a half years, Mobutu's battered image has<BR>recovered significantly following the outbreak of the Rwandan crisis<BR>which sent more than 2 million refugees across the border, focusing<BR>international attention on Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Belgium and a number of other Western countries severed diplomatic<BR>ties three years ago following Mobutu's reluctance to speed up<BR>democratic reforms, resulting in a series of violent riots and army<BR>mutinies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts say Mobutu appears to be firmly in control of his chaotic<BR>central African country thanks to his cooperation with the<BR>international community over the Rwandan refugee crisis, and economic<BR>reforms instituted by Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other issues top on the summit's agenda would be how to deal<BR>with the crisis sparked by the military regime of General Sani Abacha<BR>in Nigeria following the execution of human rights campaigner, Ken<BR>Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority Ogoni leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit is also expected to discuss the peace process in Liberia,<BR>where several francophone African countries are contributing troops<BR>to the West African intervention force, ECOMOG, as well as the civil<BR>war in neighbouring Sierra Leone. It would also review progress made<BR>by the economies of francophone West Africa, following the<BR>devaluation by 50 per cent of their common currency, the CFA franc<BR>early 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Government has been advised to write off debts of small-scale farmers in drought affected areas to allow more farmers back into the credit worthy net, The Post has learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A list of some 220,000 small-scale farmers eligible for debt relief due to<BR>drought has been drawn up, according to a report by the technical committee<BR>of economic ministers obtained by The Post. The report says the write-off would involve a maximum sum of K28.5 billion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report, dated November 10, 1995, government should consider writing off the outstanding debts on an individual basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the report has warned against wholesale forgiveness as this would<BR>send the wrong signals and lead to future wholesale defaulting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Obviously, the review of outstanding debts of small-scale farmers has to be undertaken carefully; wholesale forgiveness can not be considered as a<BR>realistic option as this would send the wrong signals and lead to future<BR>wholesale defaulting again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Timely action now will clear the way for these farmers to get access to the delivery of agricultural credit during the 1995/96 production season,&quot; the<BR>report further reads. &quot;The proposed debt write-off would have to be off set<BR>against all debts outstanding from fertilizer loans as well as the<BR>disbursement of marketing promissory note credit owed to government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report says the lending institutions that made the loans to the farmers<BR>should be allowed a &quot;corresponding debt write-off in the amounts owed to<BR>them by drought-affected small-scale farmers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report further says the write-off would involve a maximum sum of K28.5<BR>billion to be off-set against the current outstanding debt of the lending<BR>institutions to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, according to the report, the debt write-off will reduce the 'book<BR>value' of money owed to government, but will have no direct negative<BR>financial effect on government finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These fertilizer loans, both in cash and in kind, originate from 1991/92,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1993/94 and 1994/95 and should be considered as 'bad debts&quot;; neither the<BR>individual small scale farmers nor the lending institutions will ever be<BR>able to repay these,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee is made up of ministers and technical advisers from the<BR>finance, commerce and agriculture ministries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The demand for drought relief requirements has dropped by more than ten per cent, it has been learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to report by the technical committee of economic ministers<BR>released yesterday said the 1995 showed that there had been a downward<BR>adjustment from 85,700 to 77,300 metric tonnes of relief food.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report said the results were based on the assesment conducted by the<BR>World Food Programme, the Programme Against Malnutrition and Care<BR>International last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Total pledges, including commodities already arrived, committed or being<BR>finalised, equal 75, 705 metric tonnes or approximately 98 per cent of total<BR>requirements,&quot; reads a brief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the commitee, which has representatives from the commerce, finance<BR>and agricultural ministries, expressed worry on the distribution of relief<BR>maize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While the aggregate national requirements for food relief will be largely<BR>met, much concerns remain regarding the actual distribution and targeting<BR>mechanisms being used at provincial and district levels to reach effectively<BR>the seriously affected population groups,&quot; the brief further reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report has also expressed concern on the implementation of the<BR>distribution methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It cited the programmes like the food-for-free, food-for-work and<BR>cash-for-work projects; the food-for-sale activities which it said it could<BR>have some effects on normal marketing operations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post Of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>December 6, 1995<BR>by John on Wednesday (Column)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are moments, as a citizen, that I have felt hopeless and frustrated by the people we entrusted the government machinery to ensure and secure the<BR>greatest happiness of the greatest majority of the people. Some of the<BR>problems being experienced are simple and can be adequately addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The frustration comes in primarily because one is convinced that there is a<BR>better way of solving the problems, but there are no channels between<BR>yourself and those in leadership to air such ideas. But such channels of<BR>communications do not exist. There is hardly any unity between those in<BR>power and the people. The people appear to have their own agenda which is<BR>diametrically opposed to that of those in power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This feeling was reactivated in me when I heard on the news that State House has invited journalists from both government and owned media institutions to travel to Zaire to establish whether the reports published in this paper about the President's place of birth are true or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The more I think about this course the more I get enraged. Whoever has<BR>dreamt the scheme is very dull and childish and need not to be associated<BR>with the office of the President in whatever capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scheme reveals the calibre of the people surrounding Chiluba as<BR>advisers. Admittedly, the allegations made about the Chiluba's origin are<BR>serious and threaten the foundation of our system of government. But what is<BR>objectionable is the method which has been devised to address the problem.<BR>It spells a crisis among the people surrounding Chiluba they have run out of<BR>ideas on how to rebut the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe there is a cheaper and most effective way to dispel these<BR>allegations which many people have suggested. A lot of allegations have been<BR>made against Chiluba and his traditional attitude has been to ignore them<BR>and treat them as none issues. No doubt Chiluba cannot be expected to<BR>respond to every allegations which are published in the media. But there are<BR>some allegations such as those concerning his origins, which need to be<BR>treated with the seriousness they deserve rather than attempt to cheapen<BR>them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These allegations will not just die away. We have elections next year and if Chiluba has intentions of contesting for the second term then he has to<BR>settle this issue once and for all and in the most mature and responsible manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not enough for Chiluba to casually make reference to them at a<BR>political rally or any other not so serious forum, or to let his ministers<BR>or assistants to clear the mess for him. The issue at hand is bigger than<BR>Richard Sakala or Sata or Sampa. Any statement by any person other than<BR>Chiluba will not wash, because we have heard them before. The issue<BR>threatens Chiluba's very existence as a person and secondly the Presidency.<BR>It is unthinkable for any person to remain idle when his very person is<BR>being questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everything about Chiluba has been disputed. His academic qualifications have been questioned, it is alleged that he used another person's certificate to get a job and that the real Frederick Chiluba exists. Controversy still<BR>surrounds his father. Luka Chabala maintains that he is the father to Chiluba. Now it is place of birth being questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On none of these issues has Chiluba cared to make any serious comment and<BR>yet these are very serious allegations. Only an insane person can claim that<BR>one is his son when this is not true. With the advancement of technology<BR>this can easily be settled through DNA tests. It is an insult to one's<BR>intellect and one's own being to allege that he used another person's<BR>academic papers to get a job. It defies logic for one to remain silent in<BR>the midst of all these allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba is on record that he was born on the Copperbelt but people<BR>conversant with the system at that time maintain that if the Chiluba's<BR>version is true there should be some records to establish to support is<BR>contention. as usual Chiluba has not risen to the challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some people have read the revelations in this paper in disbelief and<BR>remained hoping that Chiluba will come out and say that what was written was<BR>not true and regain our confidence and trust in him by giving us his side of<BR>the story. But with equal disbelief we have watched this opportunity slip<BR>away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But to put together a team of journalists mostly from government media to<BR>dispel the allegations made against Chiluba is insane and an abuse of<BR>office. What is being questioned is not the office of the President but the<BR>person occupying that office. Although the allegations made affect the<BR>Presidency what is in issue is Chiluba as a person. This is a purely private<BR>matter which Chiluba in his own private capacity must address. Government<BR>resources or employees should not be employed in such a venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba should have come out in the open and declare that enough was enough<BR>and put these allegations to an end by presenting his side of the story.<BR>Otherwise the only logical conclusion is that there is no Chiluba's side of<BR>the story.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post Of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>December 5, 1995<BR>by Staff Reporters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - State House has organised a trip to Zaire for any journalist who wants to verify Post stories of last week reporting that President Chiluba was<BR>born in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State House presidential aide Richard Sakala said arrangements for the trip<BR>had been left in the hands of the government-owned Zambia Information<BR>Services (ZIS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The trip is to go and verify the Post stories about President Chiluba and<BR>it is an open invitation to both local and international journalists. Each<BR>organisation is, however, supposed to meet its own costs,&quot; Sakala said and<BR>then referred everything to ZIS.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also emphasised that the invitation was especially for The Post since it<BR>was the originator of the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post last week reported it had seen and obtained copies of birth records indicating Chiluba was born at Chibambo Mission Hospital in Zaire (then Belgian Congo). But after the visit by Post investigators, the Zairean<BR>government took control of the hospital and changed its name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIS phoned The Post to extend the invitation. However, they said nothing to<BR>indicate the invitation was &quot;especially&quot; for The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post has declined the invitation, saying that documentary evidence that<BR>was in Zaire has by now probably been removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What is needed now is not further denials of the story in such a manner but for the President to simply prove through documentary evidence that he was<BR>born in Zambia,&quot; said Post managing editor Bright Mwape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several journalists, opposition parties and civic organisations also<BR>objected to the trip and called on Chiluba to instead provide evidence he<BR>was born in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Union of Journalists (ZUJ) chairman Edwin Musaika described the trip<BR>as ridiculous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When there was a Commonwealth summit in Auckland, (New Zealand) State House didn't see any need to take a delegation of reporters to go and cover the summit,&quot; said Musaika, a journalist at the Times of Zambia . &quot;To them there was no need to cover the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It could have been better to show journalists the birth place of Jesus<BR>Christ. This is a waste of public funds, unless they are using MMD funds,&quot;<BR>Musaika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also questioned the sense in taking along government journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In fact the whole thing is staged-managed. Suppose a state journalist comes across information that the President was born there. Is that journalist<BR>going to write the story and for which paper?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United National Independence party (UNIP) called for the cancellation of the trip and also announced it has asked parliament to investigate the<BR>matter as required by Article 37 of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP acting president senior chief Inyabo Yeta said it was improper for the<BR>executive to investigate itself or arrange such a conducted tour of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;UNIP is aware that the media has thoroughly investigated this matter of Mr. Chiluba's identity. The evidence so far published suggests that there indeed may be serious questions pertaining to : the natural and legal identity of the incumbent President, some of his principle lieutenants, including senior cabinet ministers and others in positions of political power,&quot; chief Yeta said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also said the intended trip was an attempt to cover up any evidence that<BR>may exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We also believe that this administration's programme is aimed at<BR>hoodwinking the Zambian public. It is diversionary and an attempt at<BR>forestalling and preventing a genuine inquiry,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also said a select committee representing all political parties in<BR>parliament be set up and be charged with the important task of investigating<BR>Chiluba's identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rodger Chongwe, president of the Liberal Progressive Front and prominent<BR>human rights lawyer, said the trip &quot;is not going to solve Mr. Chiluba's<BR>problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Chiluba's parentage, place of birth and citizenship have all been<BR>questioned and &quot;the journalists are not going to resolve that problem for<BR>him.&quot; He said it was quite clear from Chiluba's reaction last week that he<BR>had already sent intelligence people to Zaire to destroy birth records and<BR>other evidence, because he claimed The Post had offered a K300,000 bribe for<BR>the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chongwe, too, called for an independent inquiry by a commission appointed by the Commonwealth, which has the facilities to investigate issues of<BR>parentage, birth place and citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That is what Chiluba must do if he wants to gain credibility not only in<BR>Zambia, but worldwide,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But Chiluba would not accept this because he knows the commission would<BR>show otherwise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If he does not clear himself, he will not stand for the presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lucy Sichone, chairperson of the Zambia Civic Education Association, said<BR>Chiluba is actually giving credibility to The Post's story by not coming out<BR>with evidence he was born in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What is his problem,&quot; Sichone said. &quot;Why can't he just tell us where he was born. We have now lost the dignity of that office. He is giving The Post<BR>credibility because the visit has no dignity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post Of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>December 6, 1995<BR>by Sipo Kapumba</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Chiluba for the first time in nine days went public on December 5 over allegations he was born in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In reports broadcast on ZNBC television, he hinted the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) may today prove his claims that he was born in Wusakile<BR>township in Kitwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president said Wusakile was in existence by the time of his birth in<BR>1943 and referred to an inquiry on the housing situation involving blacks in<BR>the townships that took place about that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are even maps to show this and all this information is there. And it<BR>is not coming from me. ZCCM has said it is there, so who is Aka to tell me<BR>Wusakile was not there. (Mongu MP Akashambtwa Mbikusita Lewanika has said<BR>Wusakile didn't even exist in 1943 when Chiluba claims he was born there.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But that is a small issue. The truth will come out, that is why you have<BR>traveled to prove the truth,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State House yesterday transported journalists to Chibambo in Zaire to<BR>disprove reports in The Post last week that Chiluba was born in Chibambo<BR>Mission Hospital. The state led trip to Zaire includes a stopover in Kitwe<BR>where journalists are expected to be presented with &quot;birth records and<BR>historical facts of Wusakile.&quot; Nkana division of ZCCM under which Wusakile<BR>falls, is managed by Ernest Pilula, a relative of defence minister Ben<BR>Mwila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only journalists from the government media traveled with State House to<BR>Zaire; nearly all the independent media declined the invitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In reaction to Chiluba's comments, Lewanika has said the onus is on<BR>President Chiluba to prove where he was born and not anyone else because of<BR>the conflicting versions of his birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He is the one who opened up the personalisation and questioning of other<BR>Zambian's Zambia-nness which is a disservice to politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The solution is to have one official verified and verifiable version of<BR>where he was born, when he was born and who his parents were,&quot; Lewanika said<BR>last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also refuted Chiluba's claim that he (Lewanika) was born in 1953, saying<BR>instead he was born in 1948 in Wusakile African Mine Workers' Hospital.<BR>Lewanika, who has called upon Chiluba to produce his father's mine number as<BR>proof he was born in Wusakile, said his own father's mine number was 781915.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no miner's child who does not know his father's mine number.  If he has forgotten he should ask someone in his family,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lewanika added that the age of the people demanding that Chiluba clear the<BR>air about his nationality was irrelevant because he started the debate<BR>himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The credibility of the Zaire trip has further been questioned by several<BR>people after government quietly rushed Health Minister Michael Sata and Home<BR>Affairs minister Chitalu Sampa to Zaire several days ahead of yesterday's<BR>trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, an MMD member based in Monze, Michael Mundale, has said in<BR>reaction to Chiluba's remarks on television that since Chiluba insisted that<BR>people should have questioned his nationality before he became president,<BR>equally, the only time anyone should have questioned UNIP president Kenneth<BR>Kaunda's nationality was in 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties also continued to charge that the onus of proof is on<BR>President Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) Vice-President Kasuka Mutukwa said in<BR>Lusaka yesterday that the president should not drag along other people to<BR>help prove his case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If he (Chiluba) wants to clear his name in that way, he should do it<BR>privately using his own funds. The trip to Zaire is unnecessary,&quot; he said.<BR>&quot;We would like to know which part of the budget was used to support the<BR>trip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Party secretary for home affairs, Kennedy Samabi, said the trip to<BR>Zaire was &quot;stage managed&quot; and would not yield anything new about the<BR>Presi-dent's origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the probe needed to be conducted by a body of unquestionable<BR>legitimacy and supported calls for an independent inquiry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) official has accused President Frederick Chiluba of &quot;buying votes&quot; from the Eastern Province electorate in order to increase his chances of retaining the party's presidential seat at this month's MMD convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George Munuka, senior private secretary in the office of the party's<BR>vice-president, Levy Mwanawasa, has also challenged Chiluba to come out in<BR>the open about his true nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanawasa himself is seeking the party's presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with The Post, Munuka said Chiluba has given<BR>&quot;millions of tax payers' money&quot; to the Eastern Province MMD coordinator to<BR>persuade cadres to cast their votes for him at the convention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The President is always preaching about democracy and Christianity but what he is doing is shameful. He is actually using his powers as republican<BR>President to block other candidates,&quot; Munuka said, adding that the people<BR>themselves will decide who to vote for and should not be bought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Munuka expressed fears that the MMD was tampering with the list of Eastern<BR>Province delegates to the convention to ensure that only those whose<BR>loyalties lay with Chiluba were registered for attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Right now, health deputy minister Katele Kalumba is out there registering<BR>only those who expressed President Chiluba as their presidential choice.<BR>Those who show signs of doubt in Chiluba are being ticked off,&quot; Munuka<BR>claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But presidential press aide Richard Sakala declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I cannot lower the dignity of the delegates to the convention by commenting on such a matter,&quot; he said in a telephone interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Munuka, who is a card-carrying member of the MMD, has also joined opposition parties in challenging Chiluba to establish his true nationality because Zambians are not prepared to vote for &quot;a person whose background is not known&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many people believe the stories of Chiluba's Zairean parentage because he<BR>himself has not told us the truth. He must tell us before the convention<BR>because if he is re-elected at the convention, the MMD will have another<BR>convention next year because of the presidential clause in the draft<BR>constitution which demands a true Zambian for presidency,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the National Party (NP) has called on President Frederick Chiluba to step down from State House because, as head and manager of Security Services, the investigations into his birth place would be biased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kahalu Kenete, who is NP provincial chairman on the Copperbelt, said in<BR>Kitwe yesterday that Chiluba should step down on moral grounds because the<BR>integrity of the nation was at stake following revelations that he was born<BR>in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Once he steps down as Commander-In-Chief then the investigations can be<BR>carried out fairly because at the moment, public respect for him is fast<BR>wearing out because of the revelations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The onus is on the President himself to prove that he is a Zambian and not<BR>a Zairean as alleged,&quot; he said. &quot;Not one member of the ruling MMD or his family can prove that he is a Zambian except himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;MMD cadres should not waste time talking as if they are not patriotic to<BR>Zambia and should leave the matter to the President,' he said and stressed<BR>that he was speaking in his capacity as a concerned Zambian citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He supported Zambian Democratic Congress (ZDC) president Dean Mung'omba's<BR>calls that Chiluba should resign over the controversy surrounding his<BR>nationality but that as custodians of the law, the Law Association of Zambia<BR>(LAZ), the Judiciary Services and some key government ministries must tell<BR>the nation the truth and what was right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenete suggested that in carrying out the investigations, four ministries<BR>should be involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ministry of Energy must establish or confirm the allegation that Zambia<BR>was supplying electricity to Chibambo Mission where Chiluba is alleged to<BR>have been born and who was paying the bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ministry of Health must also direct all on the Copperbelt to establish<BR>which centre the President was born in because &quot;certainly there must be some<BR>record of some kind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ministry of Education should also establish which schools the President<BR>attended and to what grade, while the Ministry of Labour should provide<BR>information and records of where Mr Chiluba worked and how he rose to his<BR>current positions at State House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenete further suggested that the Ministry of Local Government and Home<BR>Affairs must establish and tell the nation when Musangu village was actually<BR>set up on the Zambian soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Was it a village at the time,&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These reports should be presented to parliament and together with comment<BR>from LAZ, the judiciary service, a decision would be made by parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My appeal to all these bodies is that they should not consider this issue<BR>on partisan lines because the integrity of the nation is at stake,&quot; he<BR>added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United National Independence Party (UNIP) has joined the chorus calling for the resignation or impeachment of President Chiluba. The party said it would incite civil disobedience if needed to ensure that the President leaves office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior chief Inyambo Yeta said allegations leveled against Chiluba over his<BR>nationality are evidence that &quot;he had assumed and continues to exercise<BR>power fraudulently&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The President cannot therefore continue to lead this country and should<BR>immediately step down or be impeached,&quot; Inya- mbo said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yeta, who is also acting party President in the absence of Kenneth Kaunda,<BR>further charged at a press conference at Freedom House yesterday that<BR>failure of the President to resign or the failure of parliament to impeach<BR>Chiluba would lead the country into chaos and anarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;UNIP is going to ensure that the President either resigns or is impeached.<BR>If these don't happen, we will organise all pressure groups, opposition<BR>parties, NGOs and the church to hold mass protests against his leadership.<BR>If we need to incite civil disobedience throu- ghout the country for him to<BR>leave the presidency, then we will do so,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Chiluba's leadership has led the country into a state of national<BR>crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited a long list of errors by Chiluba, including: the &quot;revelation of<BR>state secrets (tunnels) for the purpose of gaining political capital;<BR>dishonest assurances to the public over Zambia Airways and Kabwe Mines;<BR>false assurances to parliament and to the public over Meridien BIAO Bank's<BR>financial soundness when the government knew that the bank was in fact going<BR>under; credibility gap over the construction of Soweto Market by October<BR>1994 and the government's insincerity over the Gabon disaster report etc.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Yeta said these actions constitute &quot;grave misdemeanors and crimes<BR>against the constitution and oath of office of President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The President cannot therefore continue to lead this country and should<BR>immediately step down or be impeached,&quot; Yeta charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post Of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>December 6, 1995<BR>by Bob Sakahilu (Column)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - When Zambia got independence the mood among leaders and the entire nation was more of euphoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country had not only shaken itself of British rule but had enormous<BR>mineral resources like copper, which enabled it look to the future with<BR>confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government set about an ambitious programme to improve the economic and<BR>social welfare of its people. The positive effects of this move were rapidly<BR>felt and, by the end of the 60s and the beginning of the 70s the average<BR>income and per capital of Zambians were among the highest in the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The period also saw the nationalisation process, perhaps necessary at the<BR>time as it facilitated many Zambians without capital to participate in the<BR>directing of their national economic affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When in the middle of the 70s, the price of copper from which Zambia even<BR>today gets about 80 per cent of its export revenue began to fall on the<BR>London Metal Exchange, a rapid economic decline set in. Coupled with the<BR>sacrifices made by Kaunda on the struggle for independence in the<BR>neighbouring countries, this saw the living standards decline even further<BR>and in its wake followed an economic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda was compelled by those circumstances to approach the IMF which<BR>recommended a series of strict policies in return for financial aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measures included the withdrawal of subsidies on maize and increase in<BR>price fuel. These unleashed a general outcry which led to strikes and demonstrations in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda later allowed multi-partyism which saw the MMD come to power in 1991. People had a lot of expectations from the new government which also assured the nation of solving the economic crisis in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But four years in power, Zambians have been asking about what the MMD has<BR>done for them and what has gone wrong with the initial impressive programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economic experts agree that the policies introduced by the Chiluba regime<BR>have not yielded much nor have they benefited the majority of the people<BR>economically. In fact critics maintain that the MMD has deviated from its<BR>original ideals, lost vision and, as a result there has been little economic<BR>progress that has taken place since the ruling party came into power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, the much talked about restructuring of the civil service has<BR>not taken place while the government continues to spend colossal sums on the<BR>defence budget and other insignificant government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lack of commitment in the privatisation of ZCCM, which could have brought<BR>about fresh capital has had its own adverse effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The informal sector has not been supported financially in order to enable it create new employment opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the social front, there has been a failure on the part of the government<BR>to curb corruption, embezzlement, inefficiency, bribery at most government<BR>levels. Delays in the diversification of the economy has made Zambia still dependent on copper, whose production levels have since drastically dwindled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Efforts to encourage agriculture and tourism as a means to earn revenue for<BR>this country have not been seriously exploited and the two industries remain<BR>virtually dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economically, Zambia is still on a drip feed. With the population now put at 9.7 million, chronic malnutrition, poverty , increased crime delinquency and other problems, the challenge of stopping scourges like corruption becomes<BR>even greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambians have had to endure the consequences of the Structural Adjustment<BR>Programme (SAP). Now the MMD government is finding it increasingly difficult to justify the sacrifices the Zambians have made in the hope that the economy would improve.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - Text of remarks by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos at a dinner hosted by the US-Angola Chamber of Commerce and the Corporate Council on Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a speech before the UN in 1963, President Kennedy said that: &quot;Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, gradually changing opinions, slowly eroding old barriers, quietly building new structures. &quot; I firmly believe that this quote is applicable when we consider the current situation in Angola and the future of my country. Peace has come to Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My country is now engaged in an irreversible process of peace and political reconciliation. Two generations of young Angolans have gone to war, many to their death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The time has come to end war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My Government and those in the opposition, specifically UNITA, recognized this reality one year ago when we signed the Lusaka Protocols. We recognized that the past three decades of war, especially the last three years, was destroying the infrastructure and social fabric of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the past year we have moved toward the full implementation of the Lusaka Protocols. This has been a difficult process, but we have made significant progress over the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I discussed the state-of-play and the future of Angola with President Clinton this morning at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He agreed that the process is moving forward as planned and urged all Angolans to ensure that peace holds, that national reconciliation becomes a reality and that the country moves to the next phase -- one of stabilizing and rebuilding Angola.  I know that many of you here tonight are very interested in the Lusaka process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In sum, the critical phase of demobilization has started. UNITA's forces are moving into demobilization camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the Government has pulled its forces back from the demobilization areas and has placed the Rapid Intervention Police in barracks as called for in the Lusaka Protocols.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN has deployed over 6000 peacekeepers throughout Angola and soon more than 7000 peacekeepers will be in place to help ensure that the process is a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, my Government has announced that it will release all prisoners. We urge UNITA to do the same as soon as possible. Simultaneously and importantly, representatives of the Government and UNITA are holding talks in Luanda to resolve outstanding military and political issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am confident that these talks will produce mutually satisfactory solutions on military integration and political reconciliation. On the latter, we are working with UNITA to initiate the political process at the provincial level. I want to emphasize that I am in regular contact with Dr.  Savimbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have met several times over the past year and now talk regularly on the telephone. We agree that the process is irreversible and we fully understand that the future of Angola is at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We cannot return to war. Indeed, we must now focus on two key issues: 1. Ensuring peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Rebuilding the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I recognize that without peace, Angola cannot be stabilized, we cannot implement economic and financial reform, we cannot rebuild the country and we cannot attract assistance and investment critical to rebuilding the country.  In 1839, de Tocqueville recognized the importance of a strong economy in supporting democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He stated that: &quot;In democracies, nothing is more great or more brilliant than commerce. &quot; The same is true today as we attempt to stabilize Angola's economy and attract trade and investment from the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are working hard to establish and maintain a democracy in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, we know that we must do more to establish and expand a market economy -- a process that will take some time and involve tough decisions regarding reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Futher, the process will require foreign trade and investment. Angolans are looking to many of you in tonight's audience for advice and tangible action that will increase commerce between our two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola recognizes the US as the world's economic leader in the post-Cold War era. US companies have been operating in Angola for almost four decades, largely in the petroleum sector. This participation has been mutually beneficial, but we want to expand oil production and investment in other areas of the economy.  I want to take this opportunity to assure you that my Government will do its best to facilitate trade and investment.  We have already initiated a process of removing any existing barriers to expanding trade. We know, however, that more needs to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To that end, I want to stress several important points. Angola will adopt sound macro-economic policies that will stabilize and bolster the economy and promote trade and investment.  We have initiated a three-pronged strategy to do so.  Earlier this year, we launched the macro-economic reform program. It is designed to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * reduce the budget deficit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * liberalize the economy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * privatize public enterprises</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * adopt appropriate exchange rate policies, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * reform the banking and finance sectors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have made progress on ending subsidies on domestic fuel prices, authorizing the creation of private banks, privatizing some state-owned and operated enterprises, abolishing the state's hold on mineral rights, and approving over $105 million worth of foreign investment projects in construction, manufacturing, trade, and the hotel and fishing industries.  I know that more needs to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance Minister Tomas and Governor of the Central Bank Furtado are heading the team that will attempt to meet our goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In relation to the 1995 macro-economic strategy, we have also established the $212 million Consolidated Humanitarian Appeal. It is designed to provide emergency assistance, integrate and demobilize military forces, and support demining efforts.  During the successful Donors Rountable Conference in Brussels three months ago the Government and the UN Development Program initiated the National Program for Community Rehabilitation and Reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is vital to consolidating and implementing the Lusaka Protocols.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a nation-wide strategy, with an emphasis on community development.  Fortunately, donor response was outstanding. The international community pledged nearly $1 billion in assistance, with the US pledging $190 million over the next two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I want to take this opportunity to restate our gratitude for this generosity and support. But I want to keep the focus of my remarks tonight on the critical need for US trade and investment with Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Assistance can help place Angolans back on their feet, but we must move expeditiously from aid to trade, to move from assistance to economic rehabilitation and development as quickly as possible. Angola must take advantage of peace and reconciliation to most effectively utilize its vast natural resources -- assets that have lay dormant because of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also recognize the new reality of the post-Cold War era: the emphasize is on trade and investment, not security matters.  I say to you, one of our top priorities is to broaden and deepen bilateral relations -- particularly through trade and investment and in critical sectors -- communications, agriculture, fisheries, transportation, construction, finance and industrial development.  With that in mind, let me make several important points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola is in the process, with the guidance and assistance of Chevron, of resolving any outstanding obligations with the Export Import Bank. We already have a working agreement with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The Government is working hard to finalize a new accord with the International Monetary Fund and will then restructure its foreign debt with the Paris Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During my visit, I met, respectively, with the heads of the IMF and World Bank to ensure that we are working in a coordinated and cooperative manner with them. It is my hope and intention that these moves will establish and maintain Angola's credibility with the international financial community -- particularly the US.  Simultaneously, Angola has passed a new foreign investment law that facilitates investment by providing the necessary guarantees to investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, we permit private commercial banking. The 1994 foreign investment law permits foreign investors to transfer dividends, profits and proceeds abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The liberalization of foreign exchange rates should expedite the repatriation of capital by improving access to foreign exchange.  These concrete examples of reform demonstrate our desire to attract US trade and investment. I have stressed many of these same points in my talks at the White House, with leaders of Congress and others. During those talks, we discussed a number of initiatives that mesh well with the aforementioned steps that my Government has or is taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These initiatives included: cooperation with the Trade and Development Agency, additional support from ExImBank, a top-level trade mission in 1996, opening a AID office in Angola, specific education programs, democracy building, self-help programs, additional demining assistance, reciprocal liberalization of visa requirements and cultural exchanges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out talks produced tangible results and a basis on which to build. More broadly, I want to close by reiterating my Government's unqualified commitment to the following four goals: 1. Ensuring the success of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Working with all US entities to rebuild Angola.  3. Improving bilateral relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Promoting economic, financial, and trade and investment ties with the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In accomplishing these goals, Angola needs your counsel and support. As we enter an era of peace and reconstruction in Angola, I know that I can count on you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In that regard, the doors of the Angolan Government -- its Embassy in Washington, led by my close colleague and friend Ambassador Ndalu, and our ministries in Luanda -- are open to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In considering the situation in Angola, the future and the goals of my visit to the US, it strikes me that Angola has been at war for most of my adult life. For much of that time, relations between Washington and Luanda have been strained. I believe that the causes of those strains have largely passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process of improving relations began on May 19, 1993 when the US extended official diplomatic relations to Angola.  Today, President Clinton and I agreed that other problems that bedeviled the relationship have also passed. Most importantly, the war has ended and it is time to look ahead. In doing so, I want to provide you with my personal commitment to making sure that peace and democracy take hold and grow in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same holds true for my commitment to broadening and deepening economic and financial ties.  There are significant opportunities for US companies in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We want to work with you now to take advantage of them.  Thank you very much for the opportunity to address this distinguished gathering this evening, an audience that includes many long-time friends and, I hope, new friends of Angola. It has been four years since my last visit to Washington.  I am confident that this visit has been a success and I am certain that we will not have to wait another four years to meet again.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 8, 1995<BR>by Coenraad Visser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - First KwaZulu-Natal gave us a Zulu Macbeth. Now, with equally striking effect, it gives us Mozart's The Magic Flute in an African setting. This production is the fledgling Opera Africa's debut. It is entirely fitting that it should transfer from the Playhouse in Durban to the Roodepoort stage, where so many enterprising productions showed the way for our grander opera companies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Magic Flute is director Themi Venturas' first opera production. It was an inspired thought to set Mozart's mystical work in Africa, complete with the Queen of the Night as a sangoma (rather ironically sung by the only white face in a lead role amid an all- black cast). He is helped, too, by Patti Slavin's minimalist but arrestingly evocative sets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A pity, then, that Venturas' production is so static, often in the worst operatic traditions of the past. And he still has to learn to pay attention to what happens in the score, and to the words sung. When Tamino recoils in horror of the snake at his feet, that is where the snake should be; not behind his back some metres away. There were far too many silly moments like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But what glorious voices to work with. Raphael Vilakazi is a characterful Papageno, completely at home on stage and in magnificent voice.  Thokozani Mkhize is a winning Pamina, not as tenderly affecting as is the tradition, but fresh and youthful. Ruth Smith copes well with the Queen of the Night's ridiculously difficult coloratura. What she lacks in vocal ease she makes up in presence. As the three ladies, Bongi Simelane, Nozipho Mfayela and Bongiwe Khumalo are a constant delight, their voices blending beautifully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bongani Tembe fares better as Tamino than in the recent Italian season.  But one's impression still remains of a small, bland voice which is overprojected. Mike Mkhize lacks the resonant lower register required of Sarastro, but it is surely merely a question of time before these notes appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only real disappointment of the evening is the shocking playing of the Pro Musica Orchestra. The players mastered the overture nicely enough, but then lost all interest and concentration. Conductor Weiss Doubell, too, was strangely erratic, often abruptly changing tempi in mid-phrase, to the noticeable horror of the singers on stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This extraordinary production should be seen. After all, it may be a first glimpse of an exciting future for opera in this country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 8, 1995<BR>by Justin Pearce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The unique charms of Zero Patience can be gleaned from a quick run through of this film's musical numbers: a bluesy solo sung by a blonde, beehived HIV virus; a Victorian scientist, who has discovered the secret of eternal youth, delivering an ode to enlightenment values, called Let's All Be Empiricists; a chorus of stuffed jungle animals coming to life in their museum display case and protesting at being stigmatised as the first carriers of the immuno-deficiency virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the particular marriage of form and content -- a toe-tapping musical on the subject of Aids -- says a lot about this film's brand of irreverence. How it manages this without being completely tasteless is by focusing on the social malaise that surrounded the arrival of Aids in North America -- &quot;an epidemic of blame&quot;, as one character calls it -- and turning the myths on their heads. At the time, much of the hysteria around Aids concerned a gay air steward, dubbed &quot;Patient Zero&quot;, who was blamed for bringing the epidemic across the Atlantic. In the film, &quot;Patient Zero&quot; is reincarnated to challenge his accusers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The devices which Canadian director John Grayson uses in his cinematic expose provide much of the film's fascination -- the boldness of its execution leaves you breathless, the lurid colours and catchy tunes echoed by the in-your-face innovation of the plot. The 19th-century scientist finds himself a perfect niche as a perpetrator of Aids hysteria in modern Canada, implying that the old truisms about Victorian morality apply equally well to the late 20th century -- and suggesting what Victorian scientists might have got up to given the benefits of contemporary technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yet the film is no circus, with an unlikely love story and a subplot concerning the travails of a schoolteacher with HIV bringing the metaphorical shennanigans down to earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zero Patience is unashamedly activist filmmaking, which adds to its immediacy, but also means it doesn't travel well in space or time. Here in Africa, where no one has tried blaming Aids on an individual, the film's process of debunking carries less of a punch than it surely did in Canada.  But Aids in Africa is no less cocooned in myths, even if they are different.  Zero Patience is invigorating as a movie that knocks down sacred cows, and it does so without establishing any new idols of its own.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 8, 1995<BR>by Hazel Friedman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - How can an illness be photographed when its symptoms -- until the final agonising stages -- are largely invisible? How can the struggle of those afflicted with this disease be adequately documented without resorting to sensationalism or stereotype? These are some of the questions confronted by award-winning South African photographer Gideon Mendel in Positive Lives: Responses to HIV -- an exhibition recording the impact of Aids on ordinary lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A member of the London-based Network group of photographers who curated the show, Mendel played a pivotal role in bringing it to this country. He is also the only South African photographer represented in an exhibition which -- through a series of vignettes photographed in different contexts -- reveals the impact of Aids on everyday lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most visitors to the Johannesburg Art Gallery -- attendance figures at this venue have been appalling, compared to Cape Town's National Gallery, where the exhibition was first shown -- will be familiar with the background to the show. But many are probably unaware of the challenges involved in documenting the pandemic: the process of establishing trusting, confidential relationships with subjects, and the imperative of subsuming the photographic ego beneath honest, non- judgmental documentation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the term &quot;documentary&quot; carries with it the expectation of objectivity, the latter task is impossible to achieve, particularly when the subject is an illness shrouded in myth and fear. Yet, overall, the exhibition has succeeded in playing down the sentiment and focusing on the subject. And this is particularly the case with Mendel's work, which links the experiences of two countries -- England and South Africa -- provoking a reassessment of the prejudices surrounding the big disease with a small name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both essays produced by Mendel -- the first photographed in London hospital wards, the second taken in a predominantly rural context -- serve as quiet monuments to the courage of those who allowed themselves to be made visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I included the South African component in the exhibition as a bridge of sorts,&quot; says Mendel, &quot;because I wanted to form a thematic link between Aids in varying contexts. I felt it was important to articulate the different ways in which the disease affects different communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mendel's London narrative is pictorially more successful than his South African project -- predictably, because it taps into the emotionally-charged aspects of the disease within a more contained, concentrated environment. Yet the photographs are far more than exercises in lump-in-throat documentation.  They are testaments to intimate, loving and surprisingly comfortable (given Mendel's presence) moments between Aids patients and their loved ones. But, as empathetic as these works are, as Mendel admits, they cannot depict the process involved in gaining the consent of families who have learned to acknowledge the disease but not the sexual preference of their children; nor the dilemma of families and lovers torn between the desire to preserve epitaphs to the dead and the need to erase them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In situations like this, you are not dealing simply with the wishes of the patient but of those who are left behind with their grief. They are often filled with conflicting motions, and the photographer is inevitably caught between respecting their privacy and the need to educate the public. In situations like this, the photographer cannot completely escape the role of intruder and voyeur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mendel describes the South African project as &quot;extremely tough -- probably the most difficult photographic assignment I've ever undertaken -- but incredibly fulfilling. It is definitely the beginning of an ongoing journey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Words like &quot;access&quot; and &quot;education&quot; pepper his recollections. &quot;The need for both,&quot; he explains, &quot;has resulted in the transformation of Positive Lives into a mobile exhibition which will be taken to townships and rural communities around the country. By looking at these images and reading the stories of suffering and courage, hopefully people will be able to understand the disease in a new, demystified light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mendel's photographic trajectory took him through the South African hinterland, documenting workshops on Aids prevention attended by traditional healers and interacting with Aids fieldworkers who had transformed their affliction into an opportunty for educating their communities and eradicating the stigma of Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a picture is supposed to paint a thousand words, or so the clich_ goes, an exhibition of this nature is inevitably dependent for clarity on written contextualisation. Although Mendel attempts, as far as possible, to let the photographs speak for themselves, the fact that they cannot do so without an accompanying text does not demean the potency of the images. For in their ordinariness and, in parts, seeming lack of specificity, they challenge the notion that Aids only touches certain faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through the eyes of a baby who has never felt the touch of a naked hand, the actions of an HIV-positive fieldworker who preaches the gospel of the condom, and the expression of a domestic worker abandoned by her loved ones, Mendel effectively communicates the banality and ubiquitousness of an illness that is blind to colour, class or sexual preference -- a disease that has imposed a death sentence through the most primal and life-affirming of all acts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Is the Constitution good for women? Both the interim Constitution and the final one now being written are constitutions to undo apartheid and its legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ideal of equality is therefore a central constitutional value, and it is widely agreed that the Bill of Rights should entrench that ideal strongly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One consequence of that agreement is an equality guarantee that outlaws both sex and gender discrimination by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the apparent consensus about gender equality is often superficial.  Beneath the surface, there are serious tensions between gender equality and traditions followed in many South African communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of the debate has concentrated on the friction between gender equality and traditions in African customary law, such as polygyny, lobola, and male-only traditional leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is as much friction between gender equality and important rules of religious systems, such as the Jewish law of divorce, the Muslim rules of inheritance, and the Catholic men-only priesthood. Why, then, is there so much more focus on African customary law?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not, surely, because religion and custom are profoundly different. Many of the religious rules antagonistic to gender equality derive their force as much from tradition as from faith. And some rules of customary law may be as sacrosanct to their adherents, and carry as much spiritual meaning, as many religious rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The better explanation for the difference is that customary law has been put under the constitutional spotlight by its own champions. It is because traditional leaders have demanded that customary law be recognised and reinforced by the Constitution that the question attracts attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When you demand that the Constitution lend its authority to a system of law, you immediately raise the question of how compatible that system is with the Constitution -- including its guarantee of equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Religious communities such as Catholics and Jews have avoided that issue by keeping their distance from the Constitution. But the traditional leaders have invited scrutiny of their practices by seeking constitutional endorsement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So although custom may be receiving more attention in the constitution-making process than religion, both kinds of traditional rules, religious and customary, raise the same essential question: whether the ideal of equality affects all law universally, or is subject to exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some argue that gender equality is a western secular idea, and that to impose it on non- western or religious traditions is cultural imperialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact the difference between western secular law and the now-controversial traditions is largely a question of timing and degree. A century or so ago, the antipathy of western secular law towards gender equality was as marked as that of much current customary and religious law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is more, the power of the idea of gender equality comes not from external imposition, but from the internal logic of any system of law which aspires to do justice. Western secular law found that to achieve the kind of justice it wanted, it had to start taking the ideal of equality between men seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once it started doing that, it became difficult to explain why it was not also treating men and women equally. And then gender discriminatory rules started crumbling. Western secular law has been going through this process for a long time, and has made much progress towards gender equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That internal logic has the same force in religious and customary law.  To achieve justice, those legal systems also need to take the idea of equality seriously, and religious or customary communities which have suffered discrimination feel that need especially keenly. But progress towards gender equality in those systems has been slower because they change more slowly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Religious law changes more slowly just because it is thought to have divine authority. And the capacity of customary law to change has been impaired by colonial and apartheid interventions. The result is an urgent need to compress a process that has taken decades in western secular law into a very short period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How effectively does the Constitution assist that process?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the interim Constitution was being written at Kempton Park, the debate focused on a demand by traditional leaders for a clause explicitly exempting African customary law from the guarantee of equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That demand inspired women from several political parties to unite in a cross-party coalition which defeated the clause. But having spent itself on that effort, the women's coalition lacked the energy to deal with other features of the interim Constitution which still have the potential to undermine their victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One such feature is a serious ambiguity about how much of customary law is covered by the interim Bill of Rights, and its guarantee of equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is clear that the Bill's coverage includes written customary law, for instance customs codified into regulations made under a statute. But it is less clear that the coverage includes unwritten customary law -- pure custom handed down by word of mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The working draft of the final Constitution published recently clears up this ambiguity, making it clear that the coverage of the Bill of Rights is plenary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The draft deals effectively also with the religious dimension of this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The freedom-of-religion clause in the interim Constitution now in force contains a sub- clause insulating legislation recognising systems of religious personal and family law from challenge under the constitutional guarantee of equality. However, the drafters of the final Constitution have (in both senses of the word) emasculated that sub-clause by deploying an ingenious drafting device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is now becoming clear that equality is a sovereign value, prevailing over any system of traditional law enjoying constitutional reinforcement. The effect will be to energise the process of reviewing traditional systems of law for compatibility with gender equality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - On February 8 1996, more than 100 professional photojournalists from around the world will be working on a 24-hour project to find the pictures that tell the story of how the Internet has changed people's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is Rick Smolan's new 24-hour project. But it's nothing like the usual projects with which his name is synonymous -- images of specific places or happenings photographed over a 24-hour period and published in book form.  This time, it's for instantaneous release on the Internet and, instead of a specific place, the images will cover the globe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a single day, Smolan's multimedia company Against All Odds Productions (which Fortune magazine calls &quot;one of America's 25 coolest technology companies&quot;), will put up a World Wide Web site and co-ordinate the digital transmission of photographs which show how cyberspace is changing people's lives. Called 24 Hours in Cyberspace, Smolan believes it will put a human face on the digital revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smolan is better known for his Day in the Life book series, photographic books which present and express a specific 24 hours in a country or culture.  For example, his book Passage to Vietnam covers the day the United States trade embargo was lifted. But 24 Hours in Cyberspace is a first of its kind for him, as well as the 'Net. It will be the largest online event ever produced, and will be about people's experiences with this technology, visually and interactively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anyone with access to the Internet will be asked to send in their story of how the information superhighway has affected their life, and some of these stories will go up on the site together with the pictures. And the more bizarre the tales, the better, like the story of the Wall Street lawyer who answers legal questions of non-profit organisations at 3am for free, and the blind America On Line forum hostess, who has used the 'Net to make friends around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smolan believes that this takes his 24-hour photographic projects into a new dimension. &quot;We have spent the past 12 years travelling around the world, documenting different cultures,&quot; he says, &quot;We were in China during the Tiananmen Square uprising, the Soviet Union at the birth of glasnost and in Vietnam last year as the trade embargo was lifted. For us, cyberspace is another culture and place to visit, but this time around, because of the nature of the new medium itself, people can actively take part in the project, and respond with their own point of view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A group of editors, designers and programmers will set up the Web site on Febuary 8 as soon as the picture and story transmissions come through to the project's headquarters in San Francisco, updating it throughout the day.  Cyberspace will be the featured event at the opening of the Internet 1996 World Exhibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 15, a permanent World Wide Web site will be set up with in-depth stories, photo essays and commentaries. And, towards the end of next year, a 24 Hours in Cyberspace book, CD-ROM, television documentary, and a weekly news issue will be released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A large group of companies are behind the project. Eastman Kodak Company, Sun Microsystems Inc, and Adobe Systems Inc have underwritten Cyberspace. Applied Graphics Technology, Illustra Information Technologies, NetObjects, CE Software and Now Software will provide the extra technical support. And Clement Mok designs will design the 24 Hours in Cyberspace web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A provisional web site with 24 Hours in Cyberspace details can be found at www.cyber.24.com/ and another site will soon be put up at http://www.Cyber24.com which will serve as an info site on the project.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Gencor's transformation from an unwieldy conglomerate with a myriad of unrelated interests into an international mining group, focused on mining and metals, has been accomplished with aplomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through the foresight of Derek Keys, appointed chairman in 1980, whose plans were carried out by successor Brian Gilbertson, the group has become the world's leading producer of ferrochrome, one of the largest platinum producers, the biggest exporter of steamcoal, a major gold producer and a leading source of titanium minerals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gencor's revamped headquarters in Hollard Street are a worthy emblem of an organisation whose star is rising and which boasts a reputation as one of the world's premier mining houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The high-tech, marble, glass and perspex building, completed in mid-95, is a far cry from the poorly lit, cramped quarters -- reminiscent of the civil service -- which greeted visitors in the not too distant past.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the place is suffused with light, pouring into the centre of an atrium as if to epitomise the enlightened route taken by Gencor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But do its new image and business direction extend to its internal policies? Has the company, long regarded as an Afrikaaner powerhouse and the most conservative of all mining houses in South Africa, embraced the external changes in the country within its internal workings?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judging by the number of senior black managers and women appointed at both head office and its subsidiaries, it still has some way to go. Only 4,5 percent of upper middle management are black, while a mere two percent make up top management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An affirmative action policy is in place which focuses on advancing employees through training programmes plus looking at the recruitment of black candidates externally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are trying to create accelerated career paths for people who have the potential but have for various reasons been overlooked,&quot; says general manager (corporate strategy) Mike Roussos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds that there is a lot of opportunity for high-potential black candidates to advance as the new dynamic and entrepreneurial Gencor puts less emphasis on seniority and long service and becomes more achievement-focused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the pool of black employees suitable for advanced training and that of external candidates with mining experience is fairly small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gencor is decentralised into operating companies Samancor, Ingwe, Implats, Gengold, Alusaf and Billiton with each responsible for its own human resource development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We do have a system in place to track people with potential within the group as a whole, to expose them to different opportunities, and keep abreast of their progress,&quot; says Roussos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Gencor's harshest critic -- the labour movement -- scoffs at the group's affirmative action policy. &quot;There is no real transformation in relation to people,&quot; says National Union of Mineworkers assistant general secretary Gwede Mantashe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While acknowledging the group's progress, he says despite efforts to appoint black managers, the jobs are without real authority. He adds that the attitude of head office may have changed dramatically but at mine level there is no change -- &quot;the old guard is still in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So how soon before blacks reach executive status. Apart from the controversial inclusion of Mantashe on Samancor's board, no firm targets and time frames have been set to promote black managers or recruit outside candidates on to the executive board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's been a long debate,&quot; says Roussos. &quot;While some believe it is important to get a few black people on to board level as soon as possible even if it is not representative of things happening lower down, others feel it is more important to give employees more say in influencing decisions through participatory structures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes that many support the idea of giving a black candidate, already at senior level in the company, the opportunity to advance into an executive position &quot;by growing through the system&quot; rather than just recruiting someone from outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Group manager Sam Mkhabela agrees that a programme that will lead to a capable black person on the board of directors is a good idea, &quot;but at the same time -- I don't see such a programme in place with specific targets being set at present&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eric Ratshikhopha, one of two black top-level senior managers at Gencor believes targets must be set -- &quot;if only to measure one's progress&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other managers feel Gencor does not disclose enough information to them as individuals. &quot;You just work -- you don't know if what you're doing will lead to better things.&quot; While Gencor's emphasis on training programmes to equip blacks with the necessary skills is praised, some criticise the programmes as &quot;delaying tactics&quot; to avoid placing blacks in positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ingwe marketing manager Sipho Nkosi believes the setting of targets is vital but at the end of the day Gencor must work. &quot;If in 10 years' time, Gilbertson is better than another candidate -- black or white -- he must remain chairman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another perspective is that most suitable black candidates outside the organisation may be serving on a number of boards already and thus couldn't commit to Gencor 100 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Humphrey Oliphant, the other top-level senior manager, agrees the organisation should look internally for a suitable candidate, but if not available, &quot;there's nothing wrong with Oshopping outside' for one&quot;.  Resentment only occurs when people in the company are disregarded in terms of career pathing, which doesn't happen in Gencor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ratshikhopha says despite his 14-year climb through the ranks of the organisation, it will not take other blacks that long to reach his position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Judging by Gencor's statements and actions, one tends to believe that being black is not an obstacle to succeeding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oliphant says Gencor has undergone changes both at head office and at the operational level, particularly in companies like Samancor and Ingwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He describes Gencor's affirmative action policy as liberal but says while it aims to equip black personnel with skills, it fails to address the problems of white personnel who are in positions for which they are under- skilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He describes Gilbertson as a &quot;mover and a shaker&quot; who puts pressure on people to define their roles. &quot;There's a fresh wind blowing through Gencor -- people are constantly moved between head office and operations so there's no dead wood lying around ... or unassailable comfort zones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the few black women managers, Manoko Nchwe of Samancor, says transformation began with Keys' commitment to include all stakeholders in the decision-making of the group. &quot;There's been a fundamental change in terms of how people relate to one another within the organisation and how issues which impact on the quality of life of employees are dealt with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Samancor, Nchwe says, the company has switched from total management control to participatory forums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Gencor culture, Ntche believes change is slow but is happening.  &quot;Meetings are held in English but do lapse into Afrikaans which many blacks can't understand but there has been an attempt to open up. For there to be a culture change, there has to be sensitivity to the other people's interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ntche says it's quite exciting to see an essentially Afrikaaner affirmative action group moving to become an integrated South African company.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Following the move to electronic on-line communication with the masses, pioneered by the Constitutional Assembly, the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, African National Congress MPs and the Constitutional Court, the offices of the president and deputy presidents have also become neophyte technophiles. A paperless office system is being implemented along with use of unique Windows-compatible Timex data watches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two offices have standardised on PC-based applications for tasks ranging from word- processing, database management, scheduling of appointments to electronic mail (e-mail) connectivity between departments.  The executive had previously been using outdated mainframe-based software, including an antiquated Wang word-processor. A new e-mail system is being used extensively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to John Foonk, director of administration of Deputy President FW de Klerk's office, there was an urgent need to move to a paperless office: &quot;It's more effective. Managers now use the e-mail system to disseminate management decisions to personnel and invite feedback later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The system has proved its worth in circumstances where directors, in Cape Town for the parliamentary system, want to communicate with the staff located in Pretoria. An external electronic &quot;post office&quot; has been installed to allow the separate -- but equal -- data networks of the offices of Nelson Mandela and De Klerk to communicate electronically via e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk's office is also using a state-of- the-art wrist watch as a portable diary. The Dick Tracy-like Timex Data link watches keep track of appointments, tasks and telephone numbers. There are also a number of alarms and anniversary storage facilities. De Klerk's private secretary, his head of the office, and two other staff members all have the watches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The information is created using Microsoft's Schedule+ Personal Information Manager and sent via a PC screen to the watch without the need for any physical connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The watch has a special optical eye which picks up various line configurations generated on the PC screen, a process analogous to a bar code reader in a supermarket checkout. Users simply hold the watch up to the screen and hit the transmit button on the PC. The data is then transmitted to the watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The technology fits our needs perfectly. Both Deputy President De Klerk and Mrs de Klerk's diaries are managed via Schedule+ and the watch,&quot; says Foonk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of printing out appointment schedules or keeping a physical diary, the scheduling information is simply &quot;downloaded&quot; to the watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why De Klerk himself does not use the watch, Foonk revealed that the deputy president cannot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He's good at all other things, but he's not technically minded,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 8, 1995<BR>by Simon Segal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Evidence is mounting that foreign investment in South Africa is picking up and could well be higher than popular perception has it.  Information services group BusinessMap SA, the only known source to be developing a database that monitors foreign investment, calculates that since the elections last April some R8,5- billion has been committed by foreign firms in investment money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of this, R6-billion has been committed this year, indicating the trend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These monies are only committed and thus their final numbers will change. They are committed over a period of a few years. The figures are thus not fully comprehensive, based only on press reports, but they are nevertheless an indicator of a trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The numbers, notes BusinessMap, are almost certainly an underestimate as many deals are announced where figures are undisclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The largest investments are from Malaysian group Landmark Berhad (who have announced an investment of R500- to R700 million), Nestl_ (R600 million over three years) and Samsung (R600 million over five years).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BusinessMap's trend is borne out by the Washington-based investment monitoring group Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC) which reports &quot;a surge of US business activity in South Africa since January&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some five new US firms per month are opening offices or placing employees in South Africa. This is the highest rate since US firms began to return to South Africa in 1991 after years of disinvestment. In that year there were 104 US firms involved in South Africa, compared to 280 at its peak in 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are now a total 235 US firms with equity ties or employees in SouthAfrica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since July, 12 US firms have invested or committed to invest over $200 million in South Africa. These include household brands such as McDonald's ($5,5 million), Nike and Levi Strauss ($9 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Not only are US companies establishing operations in South Africa at a record rate, but they are also banking that popular consumer goods and services, such as Big Mac and Levi's, will have strong marketability in South Africa,&quot; states the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IRRC director Meg Voorhes cites four factors behind this trend -- economic growth, the strong response to major US brands, government pledges to reduce tariffs and global competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite this improving trend, foreign investment is still small relative to the size of the economy (not even two percent of the gross domestic product). It is not yet being converted into the type of large-scale, long- term investments that will substantially expand the economy's productive capacity that creates jobs and wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most firms setting up in South Africa are still largely confining their involvement to setting up branch offices. Some have assumed direct control of distributorship. Others have entered through non-equity ties such as licensing and distribution agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still by far the largest foreign monies invested in South Africa are in short-term portfolio flows. In the first 11 months of this year a net R4,5-billion was bought (purchases were R22-billion and sales were R17,5-billion) on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, compared to R185 million last year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 8, 1995<BR>by Lynda Loxton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Nearly two years after South Africa's April elections, many government departments are still struggling to rid themselves of the detritus of apartheid and emerge as sleek and efficient operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process, unfortunately, is costing South African taxpayers millions of rands either in redundancy packages or in keeping on staff from the former homelands who have no work to do but do not want to move to other areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya told a press conference last week that the government is sometimes hard put to say exactly how many civil servants South Africa has on its payroll.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These issues were discussed during a two-day hearing by the parliamentary public service and administration committee and highlights the testing task that awaits the newly- appointed presidential commission of inquiry into the rationalisation of the public service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Home Affairs Director General Piet Colyn told the committee that it had, for example, been difficult to amalgamate officials from the former Transkei into one national home affairs department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need 49 people in Umtata but we have nearly 300 ... people come to work and are frustrated because there is no work for them and this leads to dissatisfaction and strikes,&quot; Colyn said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for housing, family and other reasons, most of these employees refused to accept transfers to other parts of the country unless they were offered substantially improved salary packages, which was out of the question as far as the Public Service Commission (PSC) was concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The solution was to offer redundancy packages, which were not cheap either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trade and Industry Director of Administration Emma Ramaema told the committee that 90 percent of the staff that had been inherited from the former homelands &quot;we do not have much use for&quot;, because their skills did not match those that were needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee heard similar tales from other government departments as well as bitter complaints about the Public Service Commission's &quot;inflexibility&quot; about offering competitive salary packages for professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, they did not have professionals in key areas, which was affecting their efficiency and efforts to radically restructure their operations to meet the needs of the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It has become a priority for the PSC to be transformed as an institution,&quot; committee chairwoman Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It had to be more flexible both in terms of salaries for professionals and in terms of the paper qualifications required for certain posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Housing Director General Billy Cobbett was outspoken on the latter. He said the apartheid system had kept many people out of formal education, but many had notched up years of experience in areas such as housing and would be an asset to government. The PSC, however, had other ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mlambo-Ngcuka said her committee was considering the experiences of countries such as the Philippines, New Zealand and Namibia in restructuring their civil services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi came close to being arrested and charged with the KwaMakhutha murders, according to sources involved in the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi's name appears several times in the documents that describe events leading to the formation of the Caprivi 200, the hit-squad unit whose members allegedly massacred 13 civilians in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most important is a meeting that took place on November 25 1985 between General Tienie Groenewald, then chief director of military intelligence, and the Inkatha leader. The indictment says Buthelezi, fearing plans by African National Congress supporters to &quot;eliminate him and neutralise Inkatha&quot;, asked Groenewald to provide him with protection, information and a military capacity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The indictment contains an excerpt from a 1984 speech made by Buthelezi in the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly which says: &quot;We must prepare ourselves to hit back with devastating force at those who destroy our property and kill us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It adds that Groenewald presented Buthelezi's requests to Malan and reccommended the South African Defence Force should train &quot;a defensive unit of 50-100 men and an offensive unit of 10-20 men (on a covert basis) for Buthelezi and Inkatha&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An extraordinary State Security Council meeting was called the next day where &quot;Ministers (Chris) Heunis and (Louis) Le Grange were mandated to assist Buthelezi in creating a security force for KwaZulu&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The indictment says the State Security Council had initial reservations about the paramilitary offensive unit &quot;and it was then resolved that that aspect be investigated at the highest political level and be cleared with Buthelezi&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During a further round of discussions with Groenewald, on February 12 1986, Buthelezi requested the SADF to provide him with a &quot;contra-mobilisation capability&quot;, an &quot;offensive capability (or defensive element)&quot; and an &quot;intelligence capability&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state's indictment alleges that in April 1986 Malan asked his chief of staff intelligence, Vice-Admiral Andries Putter, to &quot;sell&quot; the covert aspect of the plan to Buthelezi. If this was successful, implementation of the scheme would proceed in collaboration with Buthelezi's aide, MZ Khumalo.  Putter's job was to &quot;explain to Buthelezi that the minister of defence (Malan) had sent him because it was (Malan's) wish to implement the plan for a paramilitary force without delay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A top-secret document attached to the indictment says: &quot;Offensive element: the task of this group is to set up a small group of well-trained troops for Inkatha that can be used offensively against the ANC, UDF (United Democratic Front) and related organisations. Further this group can be used as a personal bodyguard unit for the Chief Minister (Buthelezi) in his capacity as President of Inkatha when the SAP is not able to protect him&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian has additional information -- supplied in an affidavit made by a defector from the Caprivi 200 group who is not on the witness list -- that describes in detail how the group was trained by SADF special forces officers in offensive warfare techniques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The informant, who cannot be named because he fears for his life, explains the group received further training at a farm near Pretoria after returning to South Africa from the Caprivi Strip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The day for us to leave Pretoria came. We left in a removals truck. We were escorted by a small car with four whites (in it). It was doing surveillance. We were taken back to Nhlungwane (a camp in KwaZulu-Natal). Dr Buthelezi came to meet us. He was accompanied by Brigadier Mathe and Zakhele Khumalo, his assistant in Inkatha. He received us. An ox was slaughtered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This affidavit adds that Caprivi fighter Vela Mchunu was involved in the murder of union shop stewards at Mpophomeni near Howick (see accompanying story). After this killing &quot;he (Mchunu) went to hide at Ulundi and was received by Zakhele Khumalo, Chief Buthelezi's assistant who is in charge of Inkatha offices&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the investigation say there was a real possibility that Buthelezi would be charged because of the information contained in the secret document. However, because the investigative team wanted to build a watertight case -- and because technical details were missing -- it was decided to leave him off the charge sheet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Observers of the voters registration exercise are disappointed at the apathy exhibited by people in the last three days throughout the country. Rob Black, the Zambia programme director for the National Democratic Institute (NDI) for International Affairs in the United States, said the apathy was an indication that the exercise lacked publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was disheartening to see registration officials prepared to proceed with the exercise while the government was failing to assist. &quot;For democracy to be nurtured people should be made aware of the power to vote , which without proper government publicity, robs the nation of good governance,&quot; Black said in Livingstone yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Black, who is head of NDI, an American based NGO which is supporting the exercise, said voting should be encouraged and that the government has a critical role to ensure that this was attained. He was in Livingstone with the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president Alfred Zulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Black criticised the elections office for under paying the registration workers, saying the money they are being offered is too little for the sacrifice the people involved are making. In Lusaka the exercise will resume today after the pay and allowance dispute had been resolved. The pay was increased from K500 a day to K2,500 a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And National Party member of parliament for Senanga Inonge Mbikusita- Lewanika yesterday said the registration of voters should be suspended until national registration cards are issued to all people who have attained the age of eighteen and those who have lost them. Lewanika charged in a statement yesterday the &quot;government was aware that many persons, particularly in rural areas, had not been able to obtain NRC's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zambians want to exercise their right to vote, therefore issuing of NRC's is a pre-requisite to the registration of voters,&quot; she said. &quot;The current planned mockery of registration of voters should be stopped.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by Carolyn Mwanza</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The most interesting battle in the forthcoming MMD elections for members of the National Executive Committee at the MMD Convention will be for the post of Vice-President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not because the outcome of the election will give an indication as who will lead the party after President Chiluba or if Chiluba gets disqualified as a result of the serious questions being raised about his origin. But rather, the result will betray the party's folly in succumbing to ethnic pressures which has led to block voting based on regional tribal lines.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result of that shortsightedness, the party is most likely to end up with a vice-president without an identifiable personal following, with neither material nor financial resources to offer the party, highly detested and suspected by his ministerial colleagues, stubborn and only willing to play with others on his rules.That candidate is Republican Vice-President Brigadier General Godfrey Miyanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The political scenario that has evolved in the MMD as a result of tribal balancing and block voting has relegated the vice-presidency post as it is now dependent on, and will be determined by, whoever gets elected as secretary-general of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the four candidates who have publicly declared their intentions to contest the secretary-general post, Newstead Zimba is most unlikely to win, as it will be unacceptable to all to have the presidency and the second most powerful post in the party in the hands of trade union people. King Cobra Michael Sata also doesn't stand a chance. His uncharacteristic silence in recent weeks does not mean that his roguish and mischievous activities are at world behind the scenes. It is unlikely that the party will allow two people from the same Bemba speaking tribal grouping to dominate it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, the post of secretary-general is most likely to be taken by Southern Province, either Vernon Mwaanga or Frederick Hapunda could best be elected. Hapunda, as matters stand now, appears to have an edge because Southern Province can trade him with other provinces in line with the block voting arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, Luminzu Shima-ponda will not stand a chance to win the vice-presidency as the party, conscious of tribal balancing, will not accept having the secretary-general and vice-president from the same region or tribal grouping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miyanda could therefore become party vice-president by default. It is possible that certain influencial people in the party realise this possibility and are most uncomfortable with the prospect. When B.Y. Mwila recently accused Miyanda of being short on integrity, it was more out of fear of the man whom he saw, with nothing to offer, occupying a more presitigious position in the party. It was certainly not intended to block the ascendancy of Miyanda as no proof of that shortage of integrity was given, it was a cry of a frustrated man who realises that his wealth and influence in the party cannot alter certain realities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the other vice-presidential candidate, Christon Tembo, his chances against Miyanda are minimal. Both are Easterners and the East cannot trade any candidate because it has nothing to offer the party in view of the strong UNIP influence in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miyanda's chances against Tembo arise from the fact that Miyanda elicits certain emotions in people which make them feel he could have a sobering influence on the excesses of his ministerial collegues, and for that, he could beat Tembo hands down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this whole scenario, I hope I can be proved wrong.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A Lusaka stock broker has advised the government to liaise closely with pension fund mangers each time new shares are being floated to the public to avoid under subscription of such shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nduba Namoonde, general manager of Finance Securities Limited of Lusaka, said this yesterday in reaction to The Post's revelation on Wednesday that only 60 per cent of the Rothmans of Pall Mall shares which were offered to the public had been bought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said pension funds like the Zambia National Provident Fund, Mukuba Pension Scheme and the Civil Service Pension Fund have a lot of money which they could invest in shares but are unable to do so sometimes due to short notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The floatation should be planned in such a way that fund managers are given enough time to refer issues of their participation to their respective boards for approval,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources have attributed the under subscription of the Rothmans of Pall Mall shares, which were offered on November 6, to non-participation of pension funds in the offer. That is partly attributed to the recent turmoil in the banking sector which saw the collapse of Africa Commercial, Commerce Bank and Cooperative banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namoonde said another reason the Rothmans shares did not do very well was that most people were disappointed with the fall in Chilanga Cement shares from K65 when they were issued in May to K58 at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He remarked that the under subscription of the Rothmans shares means that there will be less of a demand once they are listed on the exchange, possibly today if all goes according to plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rothmans offer closed on December 4 and a total of 30,238,848 shares were on sale to the public. They represented 18.75 per cent of the total shares and they were held by the Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation on behalf of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka Stock Exchange general manager Charles Mate said in an interview on Monday that the drop in Chilanga shares was due to a slump in the economy which resulted in little demand for cement in the building industry. However, he said in the long run investment in stocks had proved to be a better hedge against inflation because the returns generally out performed other options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a group of indigenous banks and financial institutions has proposed the creation of a deposit protection scheme to safeguard customers' money in the event of bank problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scheme will be financed by the banks, who have tentatively agreed to contribute one per cent of their total monthly deposits to the fund which could be used to pay depositors in the event that any of them closed.  Included in the group are Chase Trust, First Alliance, Credit Africa, First Merchant, Manifold, Prudence and Safe Deposit banks while the financial institutions are Unifinance and Union Leasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Safe Deposit Bank managing director Ramaswamy Chan-drasekhar said in an interview yesterday that the fund was meant to restore public confidence in local banks which had been shaken by the collapse of Meridien BIAO, Africa Commercial, Commerce and Cooperative banks in the last few months. He said that in addition to the scheme, the banks intend to work out a mechanism to reduce the period of clearing local cheques to one day from the current four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another objective of the group, which is simply called a &quot;coordinating committee,&quot; is to promote exchange of information which should reduce the possibility of multiple-borrowing embezzlement and fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chandrasekhar said the government could play a leading role in restoring confidence in local banks by continuing to maintain deposits with local banks instead of withdrawing just because others had failed. He also called for stricter banking supervision coupled with timely action to prevent banks from collapsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Credit Africa Bank managing director Ben Muntanga, who is chairman of the group, said local banks have &quot;special needs&quot; which they need to address themselves.&quot;Amongst ourselves we could arrange to have cheques cleared fast to improve our service to customers and in the process get a better market share,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that unlike the large multi-national banks whose customers are mainly multi-national companies and big corporations, local banks serve mostly small depositors and emerging local companies whose needs are quite peculiar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muntanga said the group would not be a rival to the bankers association but would complement it. Bank of Zambia spokesman Kabinga Pande said BOZ was aware of the group's formation, adding that the members must have had a good reason to form it. And commenting on the depositors' insurance scheme which BOZ is working out, he said it is a long process which requires consultation and detailed study before recommendations are tabled to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BOZ governor Jacob Mwanza told a group of journalists last week that the central bank was working out the scheme but did not indicate when it would be in operation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by Jon Swift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It is to the credit of the new-style South African Rugby Football Union that the process of changing the top playing management has been a fairly smooth affair. And while there has been some chopping and changing, this has been without the blood-letting which has typified such changes both historically and in the not-so-distant past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been achieved in much the same way as the success of the Springboks in the World Cup -- by building something akin to a squad system into team management.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been little doubt for some time that Andre Markgraaff of Griquas would be the man to take over the reins as coach from Kitch Christie.  This has become reality now that Christie and Markgraaff form the top end of the coaching staff at national level. Christie continues in his highly successful role for at least seven of the 11 internationals already scheduled for the coming season, Markgraaff serves as his deputy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Morne du Plessis stepping down as a selector, Markgraaff also joins Christie and Piet Jooste on the panel. It is a sensible and logical move on two fronts. First, Markgraaff gets hands-on exposure to the way Christie has tended to shape the national side through the extended squad system and ensure that this particular winning wheel does not go through a process of being reinvented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, the new assistant coach is a direct part of the on-the-field process of honing the side to the peaks of homogeneity Christie has demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this respect there is also the welcome addition of Ray Mordt to the equation. Mordt, who will handle the backline and fitness coaching under the top two, is widely recognised as one of the toughest taskmasters in world rugby. If nothing else, Springbok teams over the testing year ahead will not lack for fitness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would also point to an ease of transition when -- indeed if -- Christie finally bows out next August. It all makes eloquent sense. But there are some issues which are not quite as clear cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most important of these is a successor to Du Plessis as manager.  Relieving the revered former Bok captain of selectorial duties to bring him even closer to the team is one thing. But having entrenched the type of bonding Du Plessis has with the team, finding someone to fill the managerial shoes when the time comes will surely not be as easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also the fact that having applied such reasoned logic to the integration of team management into the game, there is perhaps a case for Sarfu to apply the same thinking to the administrative management. But then the on-the-ground perspicacity of a Christie and the diplomacy of a Du Plessis are not gifts handed out to all mortals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And though Christie rightly paid tribute to Louis Luyt in accepting the Administrator of the Year award from the Rand Sportswriters -- - in the process pointing out that he was a coach and not an administrator -- there have been times when Sarfu was in dire need of the qualities already listed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by Lungile Madywabe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - 'There will be hell in Ivory Coast,&quot; said Asec Mimosa coach Zare Mamadou after his team drew 2-2 with Orlando Pirates in the first leg of the Champions Cup at the FNB stadium two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With these words in mind Ronald Mkhandawire will not only seek to be the first coach from South Africa to win this continental cup, but also to try and mentally prepare a team undergoing problems following the sacking of coach Joe Frickleton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But soft-spoken Mkhandawire seems to know what the task involves: &quot;I have been in a similar situation before and handled it and I hope I do the same here.&quot; He refused to be drawn into the Frickleton debacle , saying, &quot;It is not my department.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pirates manager Lawrence Ngubane pointed out that despite the abundance of youngsters in the team Frickleton had failed to take advantage of the situation and use them. &quot;Look at how many youngsters we have on the field today, they have been with us for the whole year,&quot; said Ngubane. This was after the Buccanners had replaced eight of their regulars on their way to beating Cosmos 5-1 in a friendly on Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pirates will go to the Ivory Coast without Marks Maponyane and Innocent Buthelezi. Maponyane is out because of a nagging knee injury while Buthelezi is out following the red card he received in the first leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Moeti remains a doubtful starter after he went out limping in the first leg. Should Moeti be ruled out, either Fish, Vincent Sokhela or Dumisane Ngobe will play in the middle. A role both Sokhela and Ngobe are familiar with. Mkhandawire argues that Fish will be considered because of his ball-winning abilities and his willingness to surge forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Fish is used in the middle then it means that Bernard &quot;Shoes&quot; Moshoe will be used as a centre back and Mkhandawire was adamant that &quot;this time around there will be no gift goals&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not clear whether Mkhandawire will elect to use big forward Mark Batchelor to exploit high balls into the penalty area. Asec looked deficient in this area during the first leg but Mkhandawire also has to remember that Bucs would be comfortably in the lead now had Batchelor not missed easy chances in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 17-man Bucs team knows that the odds are against them and a win for them will, as executive director Irvin Khoza said, turn them into &quot;living monuments&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The players looked sharp and happy in training and were not keen to be drawn into the management dispute. &quot;I do not think the sacking has affected us in any way,&quot; said Brendan Silent .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - BayernMunich star Jurgen Klinsmann's clinical finishing has made him one of the most feared strikers in the world. And this is the man South Africa's defenders will have to try and contain on Friday night when they come up against the might of Germany at the new Johannesburg Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is just under one month to go before the African Nations Cup finals and South African coach Clive Barker cannot afford to have his defence giving away goals. After the belated dropping of South African captain Steve Komphela and goalkeeper Steve Crowley, Barker must surely be thinking of who else to drop or retain and possible new inclusions in the squad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barker would not want a repeat of the booing of Komphela and Crowley which occurred during the Four Nations tournament. Subsequently Crowley was replaced by Cape Town Spurs' Andre Arendse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Germany match is the last international friendly South Africa can use to test their strength before the finals next year. And unfortunately Barker will not have a full squad at his disposal to choose from. The in- form Helman Mkhelele, John Moeti and Mark Fish are unavailable because of Orlando Pirates involvement in the Champions Cup final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But at least Barker will be able to see if Leeds United striker Philemon Masinga still has the appetite for goals. Masinga has spent most of the season nursing a groin injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Germans may be thinking about the tall striker, Masinga regards Klinsman as a &quot;handful for defenders&quot;. Barker is likely to play the combination of Sean Dundee, Masinga and Mark Williams to boost his attack upfront. Williams has booked his place in the South African squad following his brilliant performance in the Four Nations Cup. &quot;One does not become an international player overnight. Williams has gradually worked himself up the ladder and I think he has arrived at the international level,&quot; said Barker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sean Dundee, who plies his trade in the Bundesliga with Karlruhe, will be making his debut for South Africa, and with Williams and Masinga will be trying to score against seasoned international defenders like Thomas Helmer, Jurgen Kohler, Stefan Reuter and Mathias Sammer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sundowns' Joel Masilela has been drafted into the squad to replace Mkhelele. &quot;He is the perfect replacement for Helman,&quot; says Barker</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ranked second in the world, the German team would not want to dent their record by being complacent and this game is just as important to them because it is part of their build-up to the European Cup finals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - When Independent Newspapers announced in August this year that Moegsien Williams had been appointed editor of The Cape Times, speculation was rife in the Cape Town media industry that he would replace all white male staff with black females and rejig the paper to serve the needs of Khayelitsha rather than Camps Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, when he announced that Sunday Times assistant editor Ryland Fisher had been appointed deputy editor of the paper, the affirmative action bogeymen again leapt into action, claiming they had evidence of Williams' hidden agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, now that he's settled into his leather chair on the sixth floor of Newspaper House in Cape Town, Williams is preparing to do exactly the opposite -- attract more white readers and work with the staff he's inherited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the next few months I am hoping to enter into serious discussions with my colleagues -- who happen to be largely white, Ryland is the eighth person on the editorial staff who is not black -- about transforming this paper,&quot; says Williams.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The staff will be given an opportunity to discuss their future careers.  We will address the fears many people have about affirmative action, which many people translate into threatening white jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Williams, transformation begins with changing the editorial content first and the staff much later. Like many editors, he is concerned about the growing threat of the electronic media on print, and the decline in youth and female readership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cape Times has a circulation of 93 000, with 45 percent coloured readers, 38 percent white and 17 percent African. Williams intends growing the paper to 300 000 with 60 percent white readers, 35 percent coloured and five percent African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The trick is getting the content mix right in pursuit of those readers.  I don't have all the answers, these will only be revealed once I get to grips with the market, but I realise readers are angry with us because we are no longer relevant in their lives,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will need innovation and will practically have to reinvent newspapers to win back the readers we lost. Our Irish owners own both The Argus and The Cape Times and don't want them competing for diminishing readers in the same market. So The Cape Times will go upmarket and the Argus will straddle the broader readership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williams believes his stint as editor of South -- one of the stable of &quot;alternative newspapers&quot; in the 1980s -- has taught him useful skills he can implement at a commercial paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I find myself often in executive meetings saying 'at South we did things this way'. I have to continually stop myself. People from the alternative press have a lot to bring to commercial newspapers. The greatest gift from the democratic movement is the ability to be consultative, to seek consensus and to appreciate human values in the work environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps because he is now employed by an Irish conglomerate, he uses a quote from Irish poet Seamus Heaney to illustrate his mission. Heaney wrote about the need to &quot;provide space to allow hope to grow&quot; which Williams amended to &quot;allow space for creativity to grow&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My staff is the key. I have young, enthusiastic people in my newsroom who are able to see things with fresh eyes. I have pledged 80 percent of my time for their needs and instructed my secretary that if Nelson Mandela calls and I am in a meeting with a staffer, she has to tell him I'm not available.&quot; Fortunately, Mandela has not yet called and his pledge has not yet been tested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williams intends a mini-relaunch of The Cape Times next year where some of his new ideas will be revealed. He has already made some changes to the paper, lengthening stories to tailor them for a more educated market, allowing space for more in-depth news pieces and anchoring each page with a real lead rather than the sound-bites The Cape Times had begun publishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would be the first to admit I would be far more comfortable if my staff were more representative of the readership we are targeting, but they don't have to live among the community to reflect them in the paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by Leon Perlman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Internet, introduced to the world by the United States military as a method of ensuring uninterrupted global communication, is providing a benevolent peace dividend -- as a unique conduit for international commerce. But while many companies vacillate over whether to commit to the new business paradigm, a new enemy has emerged -- high- tech snoopers who hack into the Internet to steal credit card numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Globally, pervasive credit-card fraud costs both banks and retailers an estimated R6- billion annually. Internet commerce is a growing proportion of this amount. In the latest scare, organised high-tech Cyber- fraudsters worldwide are using so-called &quot;sniffer&quot; programs, which they run on computers that route data over the Internet, to capture credit card numbers when people order goods over the 'Net. Because the US government has restricted the use and export of encryption programs, the card details are not protected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cyber-fraudsters ask the sniffer programs to search data routed through the Net for 16 digit numbers -- the standard length of credit card numbers -- separated by spaces. Another technique is that of &quot;reverse engineering&quot; of credit card numbers, where a program is used to randomly generate patterns of numbers matching those of a credit card. They then use the numbers for fraudulent online ordering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Credit card numbers are often used to order expensive and untraceable items -- especially from computer mail order companies, where most computer components lack serial numbers. Mail order facilities will usually provide on-screen forms for all credit card details. The order is then processed as if the user had signed on the dotted line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cyber-fraudsters also make credit checks harder by moving the card details between countries. In one case in Britain, a user who filled out a mail order form on the Web to order a R37 bottle of chilli sauce from a California company using his Mastercard credit card was called a month later by Mastercard to ask if he had ordered some R7 500 worth of computer equipment from a British computer company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many South Africans are using the Internet to order mail order goods from US-based Internet shopping bureaux, despite official Reserve Bank discouragement of the practice of unauthorised foreign exchange dealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Cyber-fraudsters both here in South Africa and in other countries, are well aware of the loopholes in the way in which the US banking system does checks of credit card details: a card number is only deemed unusable if the card itself -- but not the number -- - has been reported stolen by the legal user. Also privacy laws means US banks refuse to let mail order companies check addresses of card owners. Under US law, the mail order company is obliged to provide the &quot;owner&quot; of the card number with the goods ordered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With this fraud problem burgeoning worldwide, some measures are being implemented. Netscape, one of the main providers of Net access software had its transaction security code broken not two days after releasing a &quot;secure&quot; version of its Netscape Navigator software. The Microsoft Network (MSN) is also in the process of developing a secure transaction system for on-line commerce. Some local Internet service providers are investigating using MSN as a secure conduit for local online commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by Lynda Loxton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - After a lacklustre year, Engen has revived market interest with the decision to go ahead with plans to list its exploration and production business on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new company, to be known as Energy Africa Limited, is expected to raise up to $100- million from local and foreign investors and will give a much-needed cash boost to Engen's increasingly promising exploration activities, mainly in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts said this week the move would help Engen side-step cumbersome foreign exchange regulations, which made it difficult to fund offshore operations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They can fund exploration from here, but if they find an oil field, how do they develop it with present-day foreign exchange regulations? They raise capital overseas,&quot; said one analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Engen's exploration activities are mainly concentrated in the Alba oil field in the North Sea, Bukha field off Oman and Nkossa off the Congo. Alba and Bukha produced 5 600 barrels a day last year. Nkossa is expected to start up in mid-1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Engen is also involved in plans to develop the E-BT oil field off Mossel Bay with state-owned oil exploration company, Soekor,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Engen chairman Bernard Smith told shareholders last week that &quot;plans are at an advanced stage&quot; to list the shares on the JSE and after the directors' final decision this week to go ahead with the project, the market expects the listing in late February or March. Engen has said it would retain a 60 percent stake in the new company, although there is some speculation that it could cut the stake if enough investors show interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Engen, which has developed a solid reputation in oil exploration and production in the international oil market, is not expected to be disappointed with the response to its listing, analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All this should be good for Engen's share price,&quot; said one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Smith admitted at last week's annual general meeting, such a boost would be most welcome after a year in which earnings slumped to their lowest level this decade (73 cents) and dividends were a measly 60 cents a share compared to 154 cents the year before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This poor performance was largely due to problems with phase two of the upgrading of Engen's Durban refinery, poor Trek petrol sales, low international refining margins and static wholesale margins despite increased costs. Engen has now decided to phase out the Trek brand and will benefit from government's decision to grant a one-cent increase in the wholesale margin, Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General restructuring is under way to cut costs and improve efficiency and Smith added that international refining margins were improving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A significant improvement in the operational performance at the Durban refinery is expected,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by Meshack Mabogoane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - As the past year saw political power shifting into largely black hands, 1995 saw gleams of what black economic empowerment may mean. The strident calls, the blinding euphoria and widespread upsurge of ventures covered by this term marked much of black efforts to enter mainstream business. And if the terms seem easy to understand the actual reality has been complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are mainly two separate but closely- related issues regarding the significant participation of blacks in the corridors of corporate power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The one is the mere increase in the number of blacks in boardrooms, serving as directors of existing companies without calling for equity input.  This is, strictly speaking, a version of &quot;affirmative action&quot;. On this score 1995 witnessed a significant increase of blacks in boardrooms with the commercialised parastatals leading the way; for example a third of Transnet board members are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Black economic empowerment, however, entails the formation of separate ventures. In this respect, the year was marked by both controversy and trauma. Two major black enterprises went through severe blues that, in the case of the African Bank, got it into the red. Even the government was partly shaken as Afbank was put into curatorship and cries were heard for the government to salvage it as part of priming or promoting black economic empowerment. Emotions released showed how steep the learning curve on creating or sustaining major black enterprises is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed this experience put the very term &quot;black economic empowerment&quot; to the test. Long before it became a fad or a war cry, going back two decades, the African Bank pioneered it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With an historic irony Afbank got into trouble at the very moment when black empowerment had become a sort of official policy. With all the effort that went into making both shareholding and top management the major preserve of blacks, Afbank experienced a debacle that brought in a &quot;white&quot; institution, NBS Holdings, to the operational rescue during the very year in which calls for the promotion of blacks reached a crescendo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course the paradox is not an argument against efforts to establish mainly black major ventures nor to slow down moves to get blacks through the upper rungs of corporate South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed it was Dr Nthato Motlana's New Africa Investments, (Nail), a black economic empowerment flagship and a major shareholder in Afbank, that brought the underlying problems to light. Furthermore, it was Nail that led in the rescue and restructuring of Afbank while both increasing its equity stake and keeping black shares in the majority. This showed how complex the dynamics are in efforts by blacks to play a role in mainstream corporate South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The saga of National Sorghum Breweries, (NSB), was a more bitter brew to swallow. Though it had survived its earlier mismanagement mess, it went on to join with India's UB International, giving the latter a 30 percent stake and extensive management control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On purely business grounds the tie up is apparently sound as UB runs a world renowned brewery, the producer of the award winning Kingfisher beer.  However, the paradox of a company that began with a black majority shareholding and effective control evidently reducing black equity and executive dominance raised questions about the real content and direction of black economic empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The term itself has actually become controversial if not outright hackneyed. The exercise has been perceived as both co-option of a black elite and its enrichment with little real control by the very same. Whenever a black economic empowerment venture is announced the black directors would either be non-executive or chairmen while the whites take on the top operational roles. This is construed as tokenism and window dressing, carried out by major companies in response to pressures from both government and organised black groups. It is seen as a subtle means of legitimising continued white control of corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even though some trade unions and some black church groups have come on board by taking equity in some of these ventures, so giving the appearance of grass roots or mass black involvement, still it does not wash well. Unions and churches are corporate bodies and whatever dividends they may get would accrue to these entities and not ordinary members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These bodies are run by the elite who stand to gain as their organisations prosper. And with unions their direct and deeper interests in shareholding may well temper worker militancy and militate against demands for radical corporate changes. This cynical view appears to have a grain of truth in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet there is also the feeling that no matter how symbolic these moves may be this is only the beginning. It is a genesis that would eventuate in blacks gaining a greater foothold, experience and substance as both the novelty wears off and lessons are learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed the complex financial engineering that brought these ventures into existence, particularly the pyramid structures epitomised by both Nail and Real Africa Holdings, (Rah) is a very important lesson in itself. it shows how much has been acquired in terms of knowing how to leverage big financial deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motlana points to the growth of Afrikaner business which mobilised capital through pyramids. There is also the example of Thebe Holdings. A genuinely black established pyramid it has shown how, with a shoe string initial capital base, it has ballooned into a major conglomerate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The year ahead may see the rise of middle- sized black ventures coming out of a more substantive economic empowerment process. This would come out of the awarding of contracts by big corporations to carry out some of their work. This outsourcing, a part of the corporate re-engineering, would bolster many black entrepreneurs who would actually be running their own ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And as the state is set to sell off some of the parastatals, new opportunities would open up for medium-sized black groups to get a piece of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And then there is the prospect of employee share ownership schemes, in which workers are sold shares of companies where they work. This would reinforce efforts at effective black mass participation in corporate governance. It would also mean dividends, when declared, would go directly into their pockets and provide real empowerment to the black masses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All this could lead to more substance being put into black economic empowerment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by Simon Segal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Perhaps the greatest and most visible achievement of the government of national unity is the dramatic reversal in capital flows to and from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Reserve Bank's latest Quarterly Bulletin and its gold and forex reserves in November bear testimony to the degree of foreign confidence in the country since President Nelson Mandela's inauguration last May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second half of 1994 and the first three quarters of 1995 have seen net capital inflows of around R9-billion and R14-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the first time in over a decade that the country is experiencing a net inflow of capital. Over the decade from 1984 to 1993, South Africa had to accommodate a net capital outflow of over R50-billion. A further R3,7- billion flowed out in the first half of 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most encouraging is that the bank is able to report the capital inflows of the past two quarters consist &quot;mainly of long-term capital&quot; which are less volatile than short-term flows. Net long-term inflows were R3,7-billion in the second quarter and R2,7-billion in the third quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this is not as beneficial as foreign direct investment in bricks and mortar. Here too, evidence is mounting that foreign investment in South Africa is picking up. Information services group BusinessMap SA, the only known source to be developing a data base that monitors foreign investment, calculates that since the elections last April, some R8,5-billion has been committed by foreign firms in investment money. Of this, R6-billion has been committed this year, indicating the trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The large capital outflows, which depleted net reserves to zero in early 1994, were only sustained by large surpluses on the current account - R46,4-billion from 1984 to 1993. The bank estimates that capital outflows accounted for a loss of at least two percent in gross domestic product (GDP) in each of these years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the net inflows, the country has been allowed to run a deficit on the current account. The deficit was R2,2-billion in 1994 and R9,1-billion in the first nine months of this year. If this is annualised on a seasonally adjusted basis, the deficit is running at an annual R11,5-billion or 2,3 percent of GDP which is considered a reasonably comfortable position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue is with its limited reserves, relatively high import penetration ratio and a high marginal propensity to import, South Africa has difficulty sustaining a current account deficit, and thus economic growth, for any lengthy period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a survey of 10 economic units, the forecast for the current account deficit ranges from R10,5-billion to R12,7-billion for this year (the average forecast is R11,9-billion). Thereafter economists are divided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seven units see a higher deficit next year where the forecast ranges from R9-billion to R15-billion (averaging 12,6-billion). Two units see this rising trend continuing into 1997 where the forecast ranges from R5-billion to R18-billion (averaging R10,6-billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sustaining a current account deficit depends on capital inflows. With strong capital inflows more than sufficient to finance the present current account deficit, net reserves have risen R4,7-billion in the first three months of the year. This has allowed the bank to reduce its foreign loans from R1,6-billion in June to R300-million in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's gross reserves reached R15- billion at the end of September. But this is still only worth some six weeks of imports. The conventional guideline is that gross reserves should cover three months worth of imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank's gross reserves rose by a sharp R1,5-billion in November to R13,4-billion. The bank has access to a further R15-billion in short-term international credit facilities, leaving some R30-billion in foreign exchange that can be used to support any temporary balance of payments deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This current account deficit comes despite a 20 percent rise in exports in the first nine months of the year. The bank notes that exports are now 20,1 percent of GDP compared to 17,7 percent in 1994 and a low of 10,7 percent in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It attributes this to the opening up of international markets, the lifting of sanctions, export incentives, the low level of domestic economic activity, a drop in the exchange rate of the rand and the opening of enterprises developed specifically for the export market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign capital inflows are critical to any emerging economy. Without regular net capital inflows growth is limited by domestic savings which in South Africa, now down to only 17 percent of GDP, are insufficient to sustain an acceptable minimum rate of economic growth. Unless domestic savings can be increased dramatically, an annual growth rate above three percent will only be sustainable if domestic savings are supplemented with a net inflow of foreign funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bank governor Chris Stals estimates that to achieve a growth rate of five percent requires a net capital inflow of around $1-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly the Katz committee that investigated the deregulation of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange finds &quot;only a few economies can grow without the injection of new capital from abroad; the imperative for international capital applies to South Africa in its new emergent form. Foreign investors must be encouraged to participate in South Africa's growth which in turn would result in the desired net inward flow of capital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite this improving trend, foreign direct investment is still small relative to the size of the economy (not even two percent of GDP). It is not yet being converted into the type of large-scale, long-term investments that will substantially expand the economy's productive capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by Meshack Mabogoane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - There are musicians who use sound as the basis for working their beings into living monuments to creativity and expression. The sounds they produce are more than musical, however consummate their accomplishment; they convey something -- the very depths, even -- of the person. Both musician and music serve as conduits for a transcendent force that imprints itself on the collective psyche and becomes part of the universal creative landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abdullah Ibrahim is in this class. In him this country has produced a first-rate musician, perhaps our musical Madiba. His music embodies many influences and genres, an indication of the cultural diversity of South Africa (and the Western Cape in particular) as well as of his vast experiences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out of these, Ibrahim has carved a distinct mosaic. It's a measure of his genius that he has been able to lift local influences up to universal levels, as much as he has managed to include foreign strains into what is close to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In over 40 years, Ibrahim, via Dollar Brand, has succeeded in forging a unique voice, an intensely personal musical tradition of his own. It is a tradition that has its roots in various legacies, ranging from sublimely complex jazz-based tunes to the simple, lyrical ditties that dart out with such gusto. Even today, the harmonic influences of pianist and band leader Duke Ellington, Ibrahim's mentor who invited him to the United States in the 1960s, and the melodic textures of Thelonious Monk still have a heavy presence in his music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ibrahim is currently on tour in South Africa, promoting his latest CD, Yarona. At last weekend's solo and duo (with saxophonist Khaya Mahlangu) perfomances in Johannesburg, he demonstrated a mastery that speaks of volumes of sweat, skill and spirit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is testimony to his continual search for meaning that even the old stuff gets fresh treatment each time he goes through it. His solo rendition of Tintinyana, for example, a tune dating from the 1960s and recorded with both local and American combos, turned his piano into an orchestra, yet retained a sense of the individuality of both the man and the instrument. His cascades of chords seemed overflowing, yet were masterfully handled, as though the streams were made to go through a well-constructed ford or dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ibrahim moved in and out of familiar grounds -- shifting from an intense, blues-based pianism, through Ellingtonia, classic harmonics punctuated by Monkish textures, to tunes that resonated with the earthy gaiety of District Six, Marabastad and Sophiatown. These shifts kept one in suspense as Ibrahim called on all the sources that have shaped his musical world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here was the work of a consummate jazz musician, confirming the view that jazz is the sound of surprise that requires both the player and listener to await the unexpected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a spiritual tour de force that took one back to the past, anchored one firmly in the present (his intense presence rivets one) and projected one into the future (he is exploratory even within familiar grounds).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 60, he is at the pinnacle of his genius. One of the few remaining movers and moulders of the 1960s, both here and abroad, he seems aware of the responsibility of maintaining a tradition of improvisation and ensuring that emerging musicians uphold it as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Teaming up with the underrated Mahlangu was yet another coup. When the two performed Ibrahim's Blues for a Hip King, another old, soulful tune which he recorded with a combo made up of American musicians, it was so distilled, succinct and spirited that the audience, which had remained quiet and entranced throughout, burst into equally spirited and spontaneous applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ending off, his latest work in progress, an orchestral piece tentatively titled A South African Symphony and dedicated to uprooted communities, was superbly performed by Ibrahim. It demonstrated that surprises are in store for us yet from this youthful old stalwart.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - The world has got Nelson Mandela all wrong. You may think of him as the epitome of decency and statesmanship providing a beacon of hope on an unsettled continent. The truth is, he is a bumbling, sex-starved old fool secretly in the pay of the white man. Or, he simply does not know what it is like to struggle against a brutal and murderous regime. Just ask a Nigerian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nelson Mandela's political judgment has more than once been questioned, but the Nigerians are the first to impugn his integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kabiru Offi runs a filling station in Lagos where periodic fuel shortages are a peculiarity of one of the world's major oil exporters.  Ignoring the threats and insults by agitated drivers jostling to reach the pumps, Offi blames the petrol shortage on corruption and military rule. So you might think he would welcome Mandela's effort to unseat General Sani Abacha. Not at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In attacking Mandela, Nigerians have a tendency to attribute to him the qualities of their own leaders. Offi thinks he has been bought off, or &quot;settled&quot;, for large amounts of cash. &quot;Mandela's body may be free but his mind is still chained by the white man ... It is stupid to call for sanctions because we are the ones who will suffer not the military men,&quot; he said. &quot;Why doesn't Mandela forget about Nigeria and concentrate on finding his wife again?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the waiting drivers waves a newspaper in Offi's face and reads it aloud. The problem, it seems, is not sexual frustration but Mandela's age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Old age is taking its toll on him. That is why he has been going round making unnecessary press conferences,&quot; the newspaper states. &quot;We want to know, who owns Nigeria? Is it the South Africans or Nigerians? If Nigeria is governed by Nigerians why then is that confused old prisoner Mandela interfering in our internal affairs?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oloibiri, Nigeria - A small rectangular sign on the dirt track into Oloibiri is the sole monument to the crucible of modern Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is Oloibiri, the goose that lays the golden egg. You are welcome,&quot; it says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few of the very few outsiders who venture to the town even see the sign.  They usually come by river, winding for hours through narrow creeks and rainforest to the place where oil was first struck in the Niger Delta almost 40 decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The well that earned Oloibiri its place in history has long since dried up, and the oil industry's web has spread across the delta. But Oloibiri's 8,000 residents still cling to promises of roads, sea walls and cash in every pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ogoniland had Ken Saro-Wiwa to play on international disquiet at environmental destruction to campaign for his area. The Shell oil company felt the pressure and scrambled to build roads and schools in Ogoniland. But there have been no such benefits for Oloibiri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When oil was first struck in Nigeria, Edwin Ofonih was a nine-year-old boy watching his father work as head labourer for a Shell contractor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When oil was found, we thought we would be millionaires. We are still depressed,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Shell was the company that brought civilisation to Nigeria. I don't see why they can't bring civilisation to us. The town is very tattered. Shell promised to build schools and to make a sea wall because the town is flooded every year. Nothing was done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shell argued that development was the responsibility of the government to which the oil companies paid huge revenues. The townspeople saw it differently. Oil had been found on their doorstep. Shell was getting rich.  Military dictatorships were getting rich. Oloibiri should get something too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ofonih does not blame only the oil company. &quot;It was the big guns in Nigeria who spoilt the arrangement between us and Shell. The army and the rich politicians ate that money that Shell was to use for our development. We don't see a shadow of that money,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hope flickered in Oloibiri in 1979 when one of the area's sons, Chief Melford Okilo, was elected governor of Rivers State. Chief Melford commissioned a road to provide a reliable route to the rest of the country.  It was under construction when the military overthrew the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All that is left is a scar through the rain forest. By the time it reaches Oloibiri there is nothing left to show but felled trees and sand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman of Oloibiri's council, Claudius Akpalakpa, laments the loss of Chief Okilo: &quot;We cannot do like Ken Saro-Wiwa on our own. Somebody must come up who has the strength to face the federal government. We are too weak.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Rwanda war crimes tribunal has issued its first international arrest warrants for eight men accused of genocide and crimes against humanity during the organised extermination of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief prosecutor, South Africa's Judge Richard Goldstone, declined to name the accused while their arrest is sought in various countries, principally Zaire where most of the killers are in exile. But Goldstone indicated that the list does not include the upper echelons of the defunct Hutu extremist regime which planned the genocide, such as the former president and prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In order to indict people right at the top you need evidence. The building bricks are people at the middle and upper levels of command,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among those most likely to have been indicted are powerful local officials who organised and led the four massacres named in the charges. All were in Kibuye prefecture in western Rwanda where the killing was amongst the most intense and only a fraction of the area's 200,000 Tutsis survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A principal target of war crimes investigators was the prefect of Kibuye, Clement Kayishema, a doctor who allegedly had a hand in all four massacres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the first killings set the genocide in motion on April 7, Kayishema toured his prefecture encouraging hunted women, men and children to gather at the main church and stadium in Kibuye town. During earlier pogroms, Tutsis had usually found protection in churches and safety in numbers. But in mid-April, Kayishema brought in experienced killers from other provinces to supplement his own townspeople in the coming slaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Sunday April 17, the prefect set off the mass extermination in his town by ordering the eradication of about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7,000 people in the church. The next day Kayishema is alleged to have fired the first shot which launched a two-day killing spree of about 10,000 Tutsis in the stadium. Among the few survivors was Edith Mukamibungo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Soldiers mounted guns and started shooting. They started at around 1pm and they shot until about 8pm. They went up on raised ground and shot down at us from that position. From time to time, one of the soldiers would appear at the gate and throw a grenade at us,&quot; she said. &quot;There were rows and rows of people waiting outside with machetes to mow down those who escaped the bullets and grenades. There were so many people you had the impression that the whole prefecture had come out to kill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayishema also visited Gishyita where a close associate, mayor Charles Sindikubwabo, was organising his own massacre. Witnesses interviewed by the human rights group, African Rights, described Sindikubwabo as &quot;demented&quot; and &quot;gone berserk&quot; in his desire to kill Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayishema, Sindikubwabo and a third man, Alfred Musema, were all involved in the fourth attack on the indictments -- the killings on a hill at Bisesero near Gishyita. It was one of the few places were Tutsis put up vigorous, if doomed, resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 50,000 Tutsis who managed to escape the murders in their towns and villages gathered on the hill with little more than stones, sticks and a few machetes to defend themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were sporadic killings until May 13 when Hutu militias were brought from up to 70 miles away. Survivors told investigators that among those who led the attack were Kayishema and Musema who shot into the crowd of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tutsis fought back killing several dozen militia men but only a few hundred Tutsis were still alive when the French army arrived at the end of June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayishema and Sindikubwabo have been living in Zaire. Musema is already facing trial in Switzerland for his part in the slaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the top members of the defunct Hutu regime implicated in the Kibuye killings are the former prime minister, Jean Kambanda, who spends his time moving freely between Zaire and Kenya, and the former information minister, Eliezer Niyitegeka. Witnesses have told investigators that both men visited Kibuye after bouts of killing to encourage continuation of the slaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rwandan government said it was dismayed that only eight people have been indicted after well over a year of investigation. Goldstone said he was preparing indictments against several other people in the coming weeks including four already detained in Zambia. But he said it could take another year to collect enough evidence to charge the highest leaders of the Hutu regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trials are not expected to begin for several months even if arrests are swift.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Railways and Harbour Workers' Union (Sarhwu), which organised the nationwide strikes on Wednesday, warned: &quot;If they (the government) are not prepared to listen, we will not hesitate to take decisive action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sarhwu's anger stems from the announcement made by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki last week, which revealed the government's plans to sell off parts of Telkom, South African Airways, Sun Air, Transkei Airways and Autonet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a rally attended by about a thousand members at Johannesburg International Airport on Wednesday, Sarhwu president Nelson Ndinisa said: &quot;This is a clear message we are sending to the government ... As workers of South Africa we will not allow anybody, I repeat anybody, to privatise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The union will not trust the government again, Ndinisa said, accusing it of acting like &quot;the previous National Party governments which took decisions on our behalf&quot;. He told the workers: &quot;The onus is on them now to prove to us that they stand by our agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wildcat strikes broke out after organised labour and government reached an agreement this week that they were committed &quot;to a process of reorganisation and restructuring of state assets&quot; in line with the aims of the Reconstruction and Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A team of six delegates from each side was will be set up urgently to negotiate a &quot;National Framework Agreement&quot; to govern the restructuring process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu general secretary Sam Shilowa explained in his keynote address at the Sarwhu rally that the government would consult labour before making any moves to privatise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shilowa told the workers that this agreement was clinched after organised labour protested vehemently at an earlier heavy-handed approach to the issue by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. He said Mbeki had informed labour &quot;in a briefing&quot; during a meeting on Thursday last week that he would be making the announcement in the next three hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no debate on whether Cosatu supports transformation, reorganisation and restructuring,&quot; Shilowa said, &quot;because we want an efficient system and to root out corruption.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu's main contention, Shilowa said, was with the way the government handled the issue. &quot;As workers your rights are sacrificed on the altar of profits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You must remain in a state of readiness, so that when we say Kubo!  Ningene kubo -- Hit them! You must hit them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by Gaye Davis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa Africa has not yet begun to wrestle with the question of whether the country should become a safe haven for, and even help, exiled movements fighting for democracy in their home countries -- but the issue is at least on the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the Nigerian grouping Democratic Alternative met members of Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs in Cape Town recently and, in a separate meeting, senior officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While discussions with Foreign Affairs officials focused on shedding light on the complex political situation in Nigeria, members of the group raised specific requests for assistance. They made it clear they did not want to be treated as refugees seeking political asylum, which can involve burdensome bureaucratic procedures and other limitations. Instead, they wanted concrete help, such as in securing offices, being granted multiple-entry visas to ease travel, and being allowed to exchange views with government officials and parliamentarians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African National Congress MP Raymond Suttner, who chairs the foreign affairs committee, said the Nigerians' situation bore similarities to that of the ANC in exile, but that a difference lay in the character of their struggle. They were not insurrectionists but were pursuing a campaign for civil liberties they were prevented from promoting within their own country.  &quot;Do we have a duty to offer to assist? It seems to me we do,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But how -- and where -- does one draw the line? Any number of African countries' domestic situations could prompt movements in exile to seek help in South Africa. In one sense, this is a compliment to our new democracy and the government's stated commitment to promoting human rights. But what criteria should be applied before assistance is granted? And, more importantly, what impact will this aid have on our relations with our neighbours and countries elsewhere on the continent?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This could be a bit of a challenge if people start wanting to open offices,&quot; said ANC MP Rob Davies. &quot;It could lead to a series of complaints from the countries concerned. We haven't confronted this in any major way yet and will have to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're beginning to see it happen, so we could begin to develop general principles that would guide this. We have a general commitment to democracy and human rights in our foreign policy, but we have not yet in a systematic way begun to address the principles underlying it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other departments, such as Home Affairs, would also be affected, so there would be a need for a co-ordinated approach, Davies said. &quot;It's mostly a foreign affairs issue, but if the phenomenon becomes more significant, then other departments will have an interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by Justin Pearce<BR> Johannesburg - Willie Nwiido's family thought he had died on the gallows along with Ken Saro-Wiwa -- until they got word he was in South Africa.  Wanted in Nigeria for his political activities, the 30-year-old Ogoni doctor went into hiding, only to re-emerge in Johannesburg, promoting the cause for which Saro-Wiwa died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa, whose exiles once fought apartheid from offices in Zambia, Tanzania and the United Kingdom, has now become the first choice of home for exiles struggling against repressive regimes elsewhere in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least four major Nigerian liberation groups have set up shop in South Africa in the last three months, and more are on the way. Zairean pro-democracy activists, among others, also operate in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nwiido is here to represent the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop), which Saro-Wiwa founded. The Nigerian Human Rights Committee and the Nigerian organisation Democratic Alternative are represented in South Africa by Emma Edigheji, a lecturer at the University of Durban-Westville.  The Campaign for Democracy in Nigeria, currently based in London, is to set up a South African office shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire's main opposition party, Union pour la Democratie et le Progres Social (UDPS), has established a branch among the large Zairean community in Johannesburg. The lobby group Freedom Flag for Congo-Zaire operates from Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian and Zairean activists see South Africa, and President Nelson Mandela in particular, as potentially invaluable allies in bringing about change in their own countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nelson Mandela makes us proud to be African by the stand he has taken,&quot; Edighedi says. &quot;He is regarded as the moral conscience of the world. We need to be close to his ears and get our message across.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jean Kalinga of Freedom Flag, sees South Africa as &quot;a model of democracy in Africa&quot;, and believes that other countries have much to learn from South Africa's transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerians are encouraged by the fact that South Africa has no history of military coups -- the fact that many West African countries closely resemble Nigeria in their political make-up has made pro-democracy activists hesitant to base themselves in neighbouring states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for all the goodwill which the exiles attribute to South Africa, it is clear that it took the hanging of Nigerian writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others to spur the South African government into action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Before the hangings, foreigners would look at Nigeria and say 'these things can't be happening,'&quot; Nwiido recalls. &quot;Since the hangings everything has changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zairean resistance, by contrast, has been frustrated by South Africa's lack of commitment to opposing the Mobutu Sese-Seko regime. Kabundi Mutombo of the South African branch of UDPS insists it was the Nigerian hangings that &quot;have shaken the South African giant from its long sleep&quot;, and accuses the South African government of keeping quiet about human rights abuses by Zaire, including murders, forced removals, and involvement in the Rwandan conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kalinga says his requests to Parliament to take a stand against Mobutu have been politely turned down, and he is equally frustrated by the apathy of most of the Zaireans who live in South Africa: &quot;In Johannesburg there are thousands of Zaireans living a happy-go-lucky life -- only here can they afford that standard of living.&quot; He warns that the Zairean community might be forced to face reality if a worsening of the situation in Zaire precipitated a mass influx of Zaireans into South Africa, which could prompt a clampdown by the South African government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian community in South Africa is smaller, but more politicised.  According to one Nigerian journalist now based in Johannesburg, &quot;almost everyone is involved in some way or another -- though obviously with different degrees of seriousness.&quot; As the regime has intensified its repression of political activity in recent months, so the number of Nigerian exiles in South Africa has grown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our secretary general is in solitary confinement,&quot; Edighedi says. &quot;To organise and travel is dangerous. Our houses are occupied by the military. In Ogoniland, in particular, imprisonment and the constant harassment of the population by soldiers has made effective organisation impossible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian activists are troubled by charges -- made, among others, by South African government members -- that their opposition is fragmented. They point out that a proliferation of groups is inevitable in a country of some 100-million people of diverse ethnic heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And they are united by &quot;a common understanding that the military regime needs to be terminated immediately&quot;, as Edighedi puts it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All agree that an oil embargo against Nigeria would be the most effective way to isolate the regime, as this would deprive the country of over 80 percent of its foreign exchange earnings. The exiles are unanimous in rejecting General Sani Abacha's promise of a three-year transition to democracy, saying the dictator is not to be trusted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutombo argues for sanctions against Zaire, particularly the freezing of diamond imports which earn the country $30-million each month. Another concern of activists from both countries is the choice of South Africa as a safe haven by their rulers. Zairean president Mobutu Sese-Seko and members of his family own property in some of South Africa's most expensive locations.  Members of the Nigerian junta, regarded as personae non grata by European countries, are said to be salting away embezzled money in South Africa. The exiles agree that South Africa should order banks to freeze the accounts of such people, and think twice before granting them rights of residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a country where, until recently, Nigerians were stereotyped as drug dealers and crooks, Nwiido is encouraged by the growing public awareness of Nigeria's plight. Yet he is disappointed that the Southern African Development Community decided against imposing immediate sanctions on Nigeria, and remains worried that the recent attempts by Abacha to curry favour with Mandela will not be backed by real change unless international pressure is maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In January, another 19 activists are facing the same tribunal that condemned Ken Saro-Wiwa. We fear they are going to go the same way that Saro-Wiwa and the others went.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 15, 1995<BR>by David Beresford</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The inside story of how the African National Congress made a mockery of atomic security to pull off one of the most dramatic coups of the apartheid struggle -- blowing up the Koeberg nuclear power station near Cape Town in 1982 -- has been told by the young couple who carried out the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The man who planted the bombs was the former South African national sword-fighting champion, Rodney Wilkinson. He was backed by his girlfriend, Heather Gray, a speech therapist -- whom he married soon after the bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wilkinson penetrated the plant's security to plant four limpet mines on the two reactor heads at the power station as well as at strategic points under the control rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack on the French-built nuclear installation -- which, it was suspected at the time, would be used to produce plutonium for the construction of atomic bombs -- was planned by the ANC Special Operations department to avoid loss of life and risk of radioactive fall-out. The bombs were detonated just days before the plant went on stream and nobody was hurt in the explosion and ensuing fire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite later denials by the South African authorities, the ANC established that the enriched uranium fuel had been moved to the plant, but had not loaded it into the reactors. It was in dormant storage. The attack delayed the commissioning of the plant by about 18 months and cost the apartheid government an estimated half a billion rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African security suspected the operation was the work of a group of highly trained saboteurs. But in fact it had been carried out by a former corporal in the South African Defence Force who made his escape from South Africa on a bicycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Koeberg operation was born of chance in 1978. Wilkinson was living on a commune near Koeberg. The community ran out of money and Wilkinson -- who had studied building science -- reluctantly took a job at the nearby nuclear plant which was in the process of construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wilkinson worked for 18 months at the plant. Encouraged by his girlfriend, Heather, he stole a set of Koeberg plans. The couple took them to newly independent Zimbabwe with the idea that they could be used by the ANC to launch an attack on the nuclear installation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC, whose ranks had been deeply infiltrated by Pretoria's spies and had recently had one of their own agents jailed on charges of nuclear espionage, was initially suspicious of the &quot;hippy&quot; who had pitched up on their doorstep claiming to have penetrated what was assumed to be the most secure installation in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After lengthy delays, during which the stolen plans were shown to Soviet and Western nuclear scientists for authentication and Wilkinson himself vetted, the ANC invited him to carry out the attack himself. He was taken aback by the request but agreed and returned to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To his own surprise he gained fresh employment at Koeberg with the task of mapping pipes and valves at the installation, for use in case of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC appointed a guerrilla commander in Swaziland to act as Wilkinson's handler. Once a month he visited the mountain kingdom -- a favourite resort for whites in search of illicit pleasures not available in puritanical South Africa -- under the pretence of enjoying a &quot;dirty weekend&quot;.  There he and his handler thrashed out strategy, designed to maximise embarrassment to the South African authorities while minimising the risk to human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They honed down possible targets to the two reactor heads, another section of the containment building and a concentration of electric cabling under the main control room. The destruction of the heads, which would be used to control the nuclear reaction, was to maximise the propaganda impact -- made of 110 tons of steel, they were unlikely to be seriously affected by the blasts, but they demonstrated the ANC's capacity to hit the heart of the plant. The other two targets were chosen to cause as much damage as possible.  The date for the attack was set for December 16, the Day of the Covenant, which the ANC commemorated as MK Day in honour of Umkhonto we Sizwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wilkinson and Gray dug up four limpet mines packed with incendiary charges from a roadside arms cache in a remote area of the Karoo. Hiding them in wine box-decanters in their Renault 5, they drove back to their Cape Town home in the suburb of Claremont where they hid the devices in holes conveniently dug by their puppy, Gaby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From there Wilkinson smuggled the mines one by one in a hidden compartment of the Renault through the perimeter security fence at the nuclear installation, depositing them in a desk drawer in his prefabricated office. From there he had to carry them by foot into the main building, through a security gate, hidden in his overalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The build-up to the attack was marked by a series of near-mishaps. At one stage an accidental short circuit started a cable fire. The incident was reported in the press and the ANC's president-in-exile, Oliver Tambo -- who was privy to the planned operation but not to details such as timing -- released a statement claiming it as an ANC attack. The claim prompted a security scare which ended -- amid much derision towards the ANC -- when the true cause of the blaze was confirmed by investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In November the firm hiring Wilkinson informed him that they were laying him off at the end of the month, but then changed their minds and asked him to stay on another month. He turned this scare to advantage -- telling them that in the interim he had taken another job and would have to leave on December 17, thereby obtaining cover for his planned disappearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As it transpired Wilkinson did not make the target date of December 16, but completed the operation the following day, a Friday. Setting the fuses to a 24-hour delay so that they would explode on the Saturday, when he knew the target areas would be deserted, he was then forced to undergo a farewell party on the premises with his fellow engineers, mentally praying that the time fuses were not defective. He flew that afternoon to Johannesburg and was driven with a borrowed bicycle to a point near the Swaziland border where he rode into exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bombs detonated, but not quite as planned; the springs on the firing mechanism proved to have been brittle and the devices exploded over a period of several hours instead of simultaneously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few days beforehand South African commandos had attacked supposed ANC targets in the kingdom of Lesotho, killing 42 people including women and children. Tambo claimed the Koeberg attack was an act of retaliation carried out by a MK unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wilkinson flew on to Maputo where he met Tambo in the ANC leader's office, the two men crying in each other arms at their triumph. Gray, who had flown out of South Africa a week before the attack, joined Rodney there and they flew to Britain where they were married in Woodbridge, Suffolk. They continued working for the ANC after a period of isolation, returning home following the unbanning of the liberation movement and release of Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC's Maharaj Recalls Operation Mac</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack on the Koeberg plant was carried out by the African National Congress' &quot;special operations&quot; division, headed by the former South African Communist Party chief, Joe Slovo. The unit carried out the major ANC coups of the liberation struggle, including the attacks on Sasol. Wilkinson's immediate commander was Rashid Ismail who is now a general in the South African National Defence Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A pivotal figure in the operation was Mac Maharaj, a leader of the ANC underground in South Africa and now Minister of Transport after whom the project -- &quot;Operation Mac&quot; -- was named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maharaj says the sucess of the operation, along with the Sasol attacks, lay in the demonstration it provided that no target was out of reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the South African establishment it created deep concern as to how vulnerable they were ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They never got to know how it was done; until now they have not known the identity of this couple.&quot; After the attack the Wilkinsons were placed under deep cover in anticipation of &quot;vicious&quot; retaliation from the South African security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maharaj disclosed that there was in fact a subsequent attack, in which a couple were badly injured, which was believed to have been an act of retaliation directed at the wrong targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hiccups in the Holy of Holies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack on the Koeberg nuclear plant was a chilling demonstration of the vulnerability of an atomic installation to attack as well as a reflection on the incompetence of South African security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authorities at Koeberg have since made the extraordinary claim that they not only anticipated the attack, but had pin-pointed the date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent book on the history of the plant a senior executive, Paul Semark, is quoted as saying: &quot;We knew the ANC would not target Koeberg once nuclear fuel was there and that they would try to attack at a time which would ensure the least loss of life. We even pinpointed December 16 1982, which was a public holiday, as the likely date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their inability to counter the threat is not explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The apparent helplessness of the authorities is even more astonishing in the light of bomber Rodney Wilkinson's background. He joined the work force at the plant twice -- on both occasions getting access to the most sensitive sectors of nuclear installation -- and yet was never subjected to security vetting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If his background had been checked they could have discovered that he had a history as a deserter and involvement in the anti-nuclear campaign. Six years before, doing his national service, he had been hospitalised after wrecking an army Unimog while going Awol with 12 colleagues during the South African invasion of Angola. Military police took statements, but apparently because of the illegality of the Angolan invasion, had failed to prosecute him as a deserter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was also caught, at one stage, breaching security, but nothing was done about it. Alcohol was banned in the nuclear plant. Testing security by smuggling in a bottle of vodka -- roughly the shape of a limpet mine -- he was caught in posession of it while wandering, hiccuping, around the &quot;holy of holies&quot;, the main control room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I wanted to have a look; you see it in all the films -- this great big room with all these banks of computers. But the tension must have been too much for me -- I drank the vodka,&quot; he recounted wryly of the incident.  Detained in the guard room, he was released after being given a warning by a security officer whom he knew from the local squash club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wilkinson's worst moment, he recalls, was when he was on his way to plant the second mine in the Reactor One containment building and spotted a guard watching him approach with apparent suspicion. &quot;My legs were like jelly and I could feel beads of perspiration on my face.&quot; He detoured and placed the device at an alternative target they had identified, in another concentration of cables under the second control room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A seemingly impossible obstacle he had to overcome was carrying mines into the &quot;clean&quot; area surrounding the reactors, access to which was gained through an airlock where he had to strip and don protective clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he discovered that pipe tunnels leading into the clean area had plastic diaphragms to keep the air clean and he was able to simply push the bombs through them, pass through the airlock himself, and collect them on the other side. &quot;When I thought of that I was on cloud nine. I had been having sleepless nights about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia had by October of this year recorded a modest budget surplus of K24.9 billion, according to Business Trends Zambia of November this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The monthly magazine published by Standard Chartered Bank said the budget<BR>was blown off course early this year owing to increased defence spending and<BR>the Meridien Bank rescue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The surplus could be attributed to the introduction of a supplementary<BR>budget and subsequent tax increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With increased taxes, revenue averaged K59 billion monthly from August to<BR>September and was expected to reach or exceed the projected K596 billion by<BR>the end of the current year, according to the magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It further states that with only half of the K71 billion capital budget<BR>spent up to October, significant savings on capital spending can be<BR>expected. But defence expenditure wages and transfers could overshoot<BR>somewhat, while interest payments had already exceeded the budget by the end<BR>of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overall, the magazine predicts that the budget should be in surplus for the<BR>year largely due to the introduction of the Value Added Tax, the 5 per cent<BR>import surcharge and the 25 per cent withholding tax on interest and rents<BR>which has lifted revenue 13 per cent above the initial forecast.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Government says it will restrict the use of the Zambezi River by other countries, including Mozambique and Zimbabwe, to ensure proper distribution of water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Water levels being compromised due to environmental and climatic reasons<BR>including drought in many parts of the world is causing worrying<BR>international tension,&quot; environment minister William Harrington said at the<BR>official opening of a workshop on the environmental impact of drought on<BR>Zambia yesterday at the Pomodzi Hotel in Lusaka.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Government plans to hold a meeting with three partner countries to discuss<BR>on how the Zambezi River can be fairly utilised in this drought situation to<BR>avoid any tension among the countries over water,&quot; Harrington said in an<BR>interview after opening the workshop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister told the participants that the two-year drought problem has<BR>affected the environment and requires mapping out new strategies on how to<BR>cope with future drought in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Drought is a source of great concern because of its adverse impact on the<BR>natural resources and its contribution to the environment degradation,&quot;<BR>Harrington said. &quot;Drought has caused much suffering among our people who are<BR>now living in extreme poverty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harrington said he hopes the government, with the help of the donor<BR>community, will find lasting solutions to the effects of the drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zambia must, as a matter of extreme urgency, join the rest of the world in<BR>the addressing of the environmental problems squarely if the persistent<BR>droughts have to be checked and water availability enhanced,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Text of letter to President Clinton On Nigeria from 54 prominent African Americans, including 28 members of the Congressional Black Caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dear Mr. President:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military dictatorship of Nigeria has plunged a once proud nation into a frightening state of national crisis. No function of democratically elected government survives anywhere in this country of 100 million people.  Despite oil revenues totaling $210 billion over the last 25 years, Nigeria's treasury has been siphoned empty by the ruling generals who have diverted billions in public funds to their personal accounts abroad. All dissent has been brutally suppressed. Thousands have been either killed outright, jailed or executed without due process of law. On November 10, 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa, a globally respected Nigerian human and environmental rights campaigner was convicted on perjured testimony before an illegitimate panel, and summarily executed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Saro-Wiwa's execution provoked a global outcry of condemnation led by South African President Nelson Mandela and joined in by the United States.  The condemnation however was largely empty of any action that Nigeria's ruling generals would respect. Put simply, absent the imposition of economic sanctions, including among other measures, an oil embargo, a freeze of the generals' assets abroad and a prohibition of any new investment, Nigeria will not be turned from its course of self-destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the past decade, more than 25 African countries have implemented democratic and economic reforms. For the first time in 35 years all of southern Africa is at peace and embracing democratic ideals. Much of this great progress is threatened by the menacing portent of military dictatorship in Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa's most populous country. If Nigeria disintegrates into civil war, the conflict will likely draw into its vortex much of West Africa with significant consequences for the rest of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Disaster can be averted if the United States takes appropriate action now. The steps you have taken thus far are of limited usefulness. Ninety-five percent of the Nigerian military dictatorship's export income is produced from the sale of oil, almost half of which the United States purchases. Oil income is the generals' sole incentive for clinging to power. Only when that $10 billion a year revenue stream is breached will they consider allowing the restoration of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent conversation, President Mandela urged you to lead by imposing American economic sanctions and inviting our allies to follow suit.  President Mandela speaks for much of Africa in this regard. His views represent ours as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Statement Issued by the Office of President<BR>Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President's Office has noted that speculation continues in<BR>the media regarding South Africa's foreign relations and how these<BR>are impacted upon by financial assistance that may have been<BR>received by the ANC.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In particular, reference has been made to the President's and<BR>the government's approach to the People's Republic of China and<BR>Taiwan, Morocco and the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, the<BR>situation in Nigeria, as well as Indonesia and East Timor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President wishes to reiterate that South Africa's foreign<BR>policy is based on the government's assessment of our country's<BR>interests and our principled stance on issues of human rights, demoprocess of setting up formal relations with any country is undertaken within the context of these considerations, and in<BR>cracy, development and equitable relations among all states. The<BR>consultation with all interested parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his capacity as leader of the ANC, President Mandela has<BR>indeed raised funds to ensure that this organisation discharges its<BR>functions, a process which has made it possible for South Africa to<BR>undergo the transition that we have achieved. Such funds, and other<BR>forms of support, have been acquired from virtually all countries<BR>that the President has visited or interacted with - including the<BR>countries which are alleged in media reports to have been<BR>disadvantaged in comparison with others on account of some pecuniary<BR>considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We hope that the media will handle these matters with<BR>circumspection, and ensure, at least, that clarification is sought<BR>with relevant government structures, before such serious allegations<BR>are made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Durham, NC - When shares of Umbono Investment Corporation began trading Friday on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), the Durham-based Sloan Financial Group chalked up another breakthrough in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Umbono is the first company to be listed in the new JSE &quot;financial<BR>redevelopment&quot; sector, which was established to support President Nelson Mandela's economic recovery effort, known as the Reconstruction and Development Program. Two years ago, Sloan established the first black-owned investment management firm in South Africa, New Africa Advisers. Earlier this year Sloan and the Maryland-based Calvert Group launched the Calvert New Africa Fund, the first open-ended mutual fund with a portfolio devoted to Africa. Calvert New Africa is the principal founding investor in Umbono, along with several other Calvert funds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sloan Financial Group, was founded in 1991 by Maceo K. Sloan, who also chairs New Africa Advisers, a Sloan subsidiary headed by Justin F.  Beckett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With an initial offering of just over 5 million shares, priced at 10 Rand each, Umbono will have a market value of about 51 million Rand, or $14 million. The firm, whose name means &quot;vision&quot; in Zulu, one of South Africa's principal languages, will concentrate on unlisted and closely-held companies in six industries, including consumer products, health care, non-capital intensive manufacturing, tourism, telecommunications and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By investing in firms with black shareholders and in the fastest-growing sector of the economy, the black consumer market, Umbono will promote the reconstruction and development program while also exploiting enormous investment opportunities,&quot; said Charles Allison, Umbono managing director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allison, who has worked for Merrill Lynch, James D. Wolfenson Inc. and J. P. Morgan, moved to South Africa in late 1993 to direct the New Africa Advisers office. Andrew Mari, a Zimbabwean-born finance professional who has also been working for New Africa Advisers, is the other member of the Umbono management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Umbono hopes to expand by 100 million Rand over the next twelve months and to obtain an minimum compounded return of 25 percent. &quot;Once we show that these returns are achievable, we expect to raise at least half of our finds from local institutions,&quot; Allison said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - The government has to achieve tangible prog- ress on the governance agenda and maintain the economic reform programme for Zambia to be granted the much needed US $300 million balance of payments support.  These are the donor demands, according to a World Bank report of December15. World Bank director for southern Africa, Kathreen Marshall, said in an interview prior to a press conference that Zambia's external financing needs have been &quot;particularly demanding in the past four years&quot;.  At the press conference in London discussing the recent Consultative Group(CG) meeting for Zambia which ended in Bournemouth, UK, last Friday, Marshall said many donors were concerned about what she described as &quot;political and governance issues&quot; and she hoped the government would maintain the economic reforms all through the elections next year.  According to Marshall, the CG meeting extensively reviewed Zambia's macro-economy. The Bank also looked at ways of alleviating poverty and &quot;a full range of governance issues in the light of the forthcoming elections&quot; including the financing prospects for Zambia.  The total financing needs of Zambia for 1996 were estimated at about US $750 million, assuming no new rescheduling takes place. But Zambia has already pushed in a request for debt rescheduling at the Paris Club meeting to take place in February 1996.  The aid partners gave indications of over US$300 million in project and commodity support, but the rest of the funding was unclear on the remaining gap.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors did not commit themselves on balance of payments support.  &quot;We have pledges of about US$335 million for balance of payments support but I must say that these are unconfirmed figures and we'll only know for sure at the Paris Club meeting. Altogether, we could have about $635 million combining project and commodity funds and balance of payments support but this again depends on the Paris Club,&quot; finance minister Ronald Penza said at the conference.  Kathreen Marshall confirmed that the figures may change after the Paris Club meeting depending on the results of the meeting and the performance of the copper industry.  However, the external aid partners emphasised the link between good governance, economic growth and improving the welfare of the Zambian people. World Bank officials said many donors were concerned about governance issues and urged the government to continue building an open and transparent system of government.  In response, the Zambian delegation said it would maintain the move towards democratic change, including constitutional changes based on consensus. &quot;We continue to practise the democracy we have implemented in the past four years. We liberalised the economy and because of this, we have managed to reduce our initial debt of about $7.2 billion to $6.3 billion. We have had very poor copper production over the last four years and this has not helped in closing the debt gap,&quot; Penza said.  The meeting was attended by delegations from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, the African Development Bank, the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the Food and Agriculture Fund for Agricultural Development, the International Monetary Fund, the Saudi Fund for Development, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Development Programme and the World Food Programme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia edged South Africa 1-0 to retain the Confederation of Southern Africa Football Association (Cosafa) championship yesterday in Maseru, Lesotho. A 47th minute goal by Zanaco's Kelvin Kaindu was all Zambia needed to wrapup a week long competition that attracted eight countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a blow for the South Africans who were hoping for another win after their impressive run in the Africa club champion in which Orlando Pirates beat Asec of Ivory Coast on Saturday and the goalless draw between their senior squad and three time World Cup champions Germany.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zambia missed a lot of scoring chances in the first half, I think we could have won by more than four goals, we really missed chances but thank God, we have won,&quot; said FIFA referee Kassie Kalande in an interview from Maseru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaindu's efforts were rewarded after combining well with Shy Kumwenda and Davy Musole to tear apart the Bafana Bafana defence. In the third and fourth play-offs, hosts Lesotho beat Swaziland 3-1 in a game which was played as a curtain-raiser to the Zambia-South Africa final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia finished the tournament as the team with the highest number of goals, scoring 18 and letting in only one in the 1-1 draw against South Africa in a group B tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the future of the competition has been thrown into disarray after two participating countries threatened to pull out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two, Mozambique and Namibia, accused tournament organisers of conniving with referees to rob them of victory. An angry Mozambican official said his country would have nothing to do with the competition in future. The Namibians also threatened to pull out because of alleged poor refereeing .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique's protest eminated from their 2-2 draw against Botswana.  Leading 2-1 after 90 minutes the Lesotho referee surprisingly added 20 minutes of injury time. It was during this time that Botswana forced a last-gasp equaliser.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia's donors have given the country US $100 million more than finance minister Ronald Penza 'begged' for. In an interview yesterday at his Lusaka's Ibex Hill home, Penza said Zambia who initially asked for $750 million from Consultative Group Meeting, the Paris Club, will now get $850 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a financial commitment by the donors for the financial year beginning 1996 until we go for another meeting next year,&quot;a cigar puffing Penza said. &quot;The only reason the donor community allowed us to over-subscribe is because we have lived up to their expectations, otherwise we would not have been treated this well.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The money which will be given to Zambia according to Penza &quot;includes debt relief and project relief together with commodity assistance which the donors have already agreed upon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penza also disclosed that the donor community expressed reservations at the manner in which the MMD government was going about with the adoption of the the constitution. &quot;The donor community would rather see a more broad based method of adopting the constitution based on consensus and not power,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also revealed that the donor community would also love to see the government leave the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to be autonomous in a bid to exercise good governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Penza interview was from time to time disturbed by paramilitary police officers whom the minister had called in to throw out the Post reporter. &quot;You had misrepresented facts when you recently reported that I was almost crying in parliament when I was asked about banks,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penza complained. &quot;I am not happy with your paper's constant use of my picture whenever you run stories on Musa Siame and Africa Commercial Bank.&quot; Penza also disclosed that this is the first time Zambia is being allowed to IMF loans in eight years since the Kaunda era.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - British ornithologist Dylan Aspinwall is still missing and there has been no clue of his whereabouts for more than a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both the police and family friends are considering increasing the reward for any one with information leading to the finding of Aspinwall from K1 million to K2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hope and pray that the efforts of the Zambia Police and Aspinwall's friends will prove successful,&quot; said Paul Russell, a close friend of the missing person.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Force spokesperson Bartholomew Jere expressed worries on the disappearance of Aspinwall: &quot;I am not trying to say he is dead but this is a third week since police and the man's family friends launched intensive investigations and searching but we have not obtained any information leading to the finding of Aspinwall so far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aspinwall, 53, a Lusaka resident for more than 30 years, went missing from his Chamba Valley home on November 8 when he left his 80-year-old mother to visit a shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He never returned and his Toyota Hilux vehicle he was driving was recovered in Rufunsa a week later. His mother has since returned to England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Russell, who is also Anti-Corruption Commission director for human resource development, Aspinwall was expected home at lunchtime that day but he never returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aspinwall is the current chairman for the Zambian Ornithological Society and was for many years a well known teacher at Munali Secondary School and school inspector before he resigned to concentrate on ornithology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mr Aspinwall is a well known and respected man both locally and internationally because of his ornithological prowess. Prior to his disappearance, Aspinwall was working on a major ornithological atlas of Zambia,&quot; Russell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have received many calls from his former students and friends from all over the country expressing concern for Mr Aspinwall's safety,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A former student, Emmanuel Katongo, said he was shocked to learn about Aspinwall's disappearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He was a very good teacher of English and an entertaining man,&quot; Katongo said in an interview on Wednesday. And many teachers at Munali who worked closely with Aspinwall have expressed deep concern on his disappearance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA - Uganda last week hosted the ninth International conference on AIDS and STD in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The December 10-14 Conference in Kampala, the country's capital, was attended by about 3,000 government scientists and non-governmental organisations from over 100 countries who in one way or another are dealing with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes (AIDS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement ahead of the conference, the chairman of Uganda AIDS Commission Bishop Misaeri Kawuma of the (Anglican) Church of Uganda said the East African country had been chosen to host the big event because of its openness towards AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Kawuma said Ugandans, at least about 10 per cent of whom are believed to be infected with the HIV virus which causes AIDS, have suffered severely since the first HIV cases were discovered in the southwestern district of Rakai in the early 80s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The greatest impact of AIDS is felt at the family and individual level... The big difference between AIDS and other epidemics is that AIDS affects the most productive groups who are responsible for support and care of others such as children, the elderly and extended family members especially in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from Uganda, Africa, said to have some 10 million HIV victims was expected to benefit from the conference because the world meeting, whose theme was &quot;AIDS-Hopes and Challenges&quot; was expected to recommend an African AIDS policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Appropriate research for intervention must be developed quickly... It is my hope that the conference will come out with... solutions for prevention of AIDS,&quot; Bishop Kawuma said in his statement before the conference began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing conference participants later, the chairman of Uganda AIDS Commission Bishop Misaeri Kawuma recommended sexual abstinence as the most viable way of fighting the deadly HIV virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told delegates attending the Ninth International Conference on AIDS in Africa here; &quot;AIDS is like the flood in Noah's days and unless people jump onto the ark, they will die... the ark is abstinence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly before the Kampala conference began, World Health Organisation Director for Africa, Dr. Ebrahim Samba singled out the Church in Africa as being responsible for the ineffectiveness of the global body's condom strategy against AIDS on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They (religious leaders) believe that condoms will create promiscuity, but we must be realistic and accept human weakness exists, &quot; Dr. Samba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the head of the Catholic Community in this East African country Cardinal Emmanuel Wamala says the WHO condom strategy is unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is like saying since murder and robbery are human weaknesses we should accept them,&quot; Cardinal Wamala said in an interview shortly before the AIDS conference began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Condoms are for loose people so by supplying them to our (Christians we are creating more AIDS&quot;, Cardinal Wamala, head of the Roman Catholic Church in Uganda cautioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world AIDS conference, the first of its kind in Africa was expected to discuss several aspects of social behaviour on the continent whose generally conservative culture does not permit openness on sex and other social behavioral issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his opening and welcome address on December 10, Uganda President Yoweri Museveni called on the industrialised nations to involve African scientists on an equal basis in their search for an AIDS cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organisation Director Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima praised Uganda for starting what he called &quot;the first National AIDS programme in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHO officials say despite interventions like condoms, the AIDS scourge has not shown signs of abetting. A senior United Nations official told a press conference here that the global body has put aside US dollars 120 million for its worldwide AIDS programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Sally Collar, said during the press conference that 60 per cent of the money will go towards AIDS programmes in African countries like Uganda which have pragmatic AIDS policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN official said United Nations International AIDS which starts its operations next January will coordinate a multi- sectoral AIDS approach in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GOZON (IVORY COAST) - At least one Liberian refugee admitted to hospital in this Ivorian border village has been confirmed as having the deadly ebola virus while four other suspected cases are being studied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Geneva-based World Health Organisation (WHO ) said 25-year-old Jasper Choa crossed into Ivory Coast at the end of November to seek medical treatment and was diagnosed to have the virus following laboratory tests. The tests were done from his blood sample at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. He said he had left a sick friend in his home village of Plibo, Maryland County.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid fears that the disease could spread like wild fires, the WHO hurriedly sent a team of medical experts into Liberia, where five years of civil war has made many remote areas virtually inaccessible. The area is controlled by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), who granted the team permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A woman who lived in the same house as the confirmed case has been taken to Gozon and is being treated for similar symptoms. Reports say blood samples from two other suspected cases are being studied at Institut Pasteur in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and results were expected by the time of going to press. All those affected lived in the same house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The virus kills by causing massive bleeding. Early this year, an outbreak of ebola in the Zairean town of Kikwit claimed 244 lives.<BR>Ebola has no known cure. WHO spokesman, Richard LeClair, is quoted as saying the Liberian outbreak appeared not to be as dangerous as Zaire's epidemic. He told reporters in Geneva: &quot;Up to now we have had no deaths. The original case is recovering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;In this case, what we have found is that it does not seem as dangerous as the Kikwit epidemic because there is not as much haemorrhaging... It may not be the same type.&quot; A third man thought to have been contaminated is also being sought and medical experts hope to return to Liberia to check on the suspected cases. Last year, in Ivory Coast, a Swiss technician was reported to have contracted the disease but later recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, in Liberia, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) intervention force, ECOMOG, was expected to begin deploying in rural areas under the control of warring factions on December 14, with or without money needed for logistics. Reports from Monrovia say the decision was made in the interest of peace for Liberia following delay in releasing funding for disarmament pledged by donors last October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The troops deployment would include Maryland County, in the southeast, despite reports of an outbreak of ebola there. A ministry of Health team which flew into the area immediately the news broke quoted local people as saying about 20 people have died of diseases in the area in the last one month but there was no evidence to trace the deaths to ebola.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LISBON - The Roman Catholic Church in Angola is preparing to relaunch a radio station, and possibly a newspaper, 20 years after independence from Portugal, the bishop of Lubango said here December 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monseigneur Manuel Franklin da Costa, who is visiting Portugal, said Radio Ecclesia would resume broadcasts from January, starting in the Luanda city area, with coverage to extend across the war-ravaged nation from March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is very important that Radio Ecclesia go on the air and provide news with total impartiality... to help Angolans draw their own conclusions on what is happening in the country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before 1975, when Angola was still a Portuguese colony, the radio used to operate 24 hours a day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishop also said that another fixture of colonial times, the Apostolado newspaper, may reappear next March. However it would be a monthly and not daily as before, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are now rebuilding everything that was destroyed in the war,&quot; he said, referring to the civil war between the People's Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA) and the national Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We hope to be able to do this because it is important for the Angolan people,&quot; Bishop Da Costa said. The bishop's announcement came amid fears that the ceasefire between Angola's warring factions was collapsing and that it would call the United Nations- brokered peace into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UN report released in New York on December 11 said that the &quot;repeated failure by both sides to honour their undertakings has cast doubt on the reality of that commitment&quot; to the Lusaka peace accords signed by UNITA rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos more than a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government and UNITA must demonstrate through concrete action that they are indeed committed to peace and that they are ready to correct these negative factors. I urgently appeal to them to do so,&quot; UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) in Angola has designated 8,000 peacekeepers to make sure the truce is respected and that both UNITA and government troops lay down their weapons and merge into one national army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boutros-Ghali said he was pleased that the slow process of cantonment and demobilisation of the country's soldiers as called for in the accord, had &quot;at last begun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he said several important tasks that should have been dealt with in the early stages of the peace process - release of prisoners, exchange of military information and the resolution of the issue of mercenaries - have not yet started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is also unacceptable that violations of the ceasefire and military preparations, including mine-laying, still persist, a full year after the signing of the Lusaka Protocol,&quot; the UN chief said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Human rights abuses and restrictions on the free circulation of the population also continue. This unsatisfactory state of affairs is aggravated by recent propaganda attacks against the United Nations and threats to the safety and security of international personnel in Angola,&quot; Boutros-Ghali said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New clashes between UNITA and the government troops over the weekend have raised fears that the truce could fall apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 10, following artillery attacks blamed on UNITA rebels on towns in the east, government officials warned there could be a &quot;bloodbath&quot; if the United Nations did not do something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two sides are clearly still vying for control over the mineralrich northern and eastern regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But so far, both have backed off from any large-scale military operations of the sort that marked the civil war, one of Africa's bloodiest, which erupted after Angola won independence from Portugal in 1975.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KHARTOUM - The Horn of Africa Policy Group (HAPG), a forum of Canadian Churches and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) involved in policy initiatives for countries in the Horn, has called for the institution of certain measures to help the peace process in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum which was convened as a working group earlier this year by the Inter-Church Coalition on Africa (ICCA), an affiliate of the Canadian Council of Churches proposes among other measures that pressure should be brought to bear on the different parties in the Sudan to ensure that peace, justice and human rights become a reality in that troubled country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following consultations with churches, business, labour, women's and political groups of Sudanese both within and outside Sudan, the HAPG also calls for the implementation of an international broadcast news mechanism that will beam radio news on a weekly basis into all of Sudan (not just the Christian South).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The broadcast would give news about the course of the war, the cost of waging war and emphasize peace initiatives in Sudan. &quot;Objective information puts pressure on leadership groups and provides hope for all peoples in Sudan working for a peaceful future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The HAPG also challenges the Government of Sudan as well as the two leading guerrilla movements fighting in the south- the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA) and the Southern Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) to live up to their rhetoric on democracy and autonomy for non-military institutions in their areas of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore HAPG advocates fool proof observance by all countries of the European Union's Arms Embargo on Sudan. The group seeks to have this embargo extended to police, security and intelligence equipment and cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the HAPG rekindled the peace initiatives, the war in the South has reflared, with the SPLA reported in stronger military position in areas south of Juba and west of Torit, the latter town once their stronghold and headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Ugandan correspondent Emmy Allio who has toured the war front with the SPLA says the guerrillas are hampered by lack of a bridge to cross Kit River, 60 kilometres south of Juba. The original permanent bridge was blown up by retreating Sudan government troops early November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allio who reports for Uganda's government-owned New Vision daily, witnessed hundreds of SPLA combatants sitting in their trenches south of Kit.  &quot;Several tanks pieces of artillery missiles mounted on motor vehicles and other support guns were strategically placed in tree shades,&quot; reports Allio.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUJUMBURA - The Hutu head of Burundi's Welfare Institute and his four-year-old son were killed instantly when unknown assailants tossed a grenade inside their car over the weekend, climaxing the orgy of violence that has left more than 30 people dead in one week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Tutsi friend of Juvenal Manirambona, a former parliamentarian who had just been appointed to the post two weeks earlier, and who was also in the car, died of wounds soon after the attack on December 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a communique published in Germany, the pro-Hutu organization &quot;Burundi Buro&quot; blamed &quot;members of the Tutsi death squad, &quot;without failure,&quot; for the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 8, two people were reported killed and another injured in a similar grenade attack at a hospital clinic after a week of ethnic unrest which ended in a huge rally for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although none has claimed responsibility for the grenade attack, suspicion also centered on Tutsi extremists active in Bujumbura.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police said 26 people, 26 militia members and an old woman - had died in clashes earlier last week in the east of the capital, but diplomatic sources said the real death toll could be higher. Witnesses said hundreds of Hutu extremists, whom police said had come from Zaire had been involved in fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political or ethnic killings are common in Burundi, where the civil war pitting the Hutu majority against the Tutsi minority has claimed thousands of lives since the start of the year, according to the international aid group Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) - Doctors Without Borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 8, between 1,000 and 4,000 women, according to various sources, demonstrated in Bujumbura in a rally for peace and against violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mayhem started on December 6 with heavy fighting in the mountains overlooking Bujumbura between the Tutsi-dominated security forces and Hutu militias which the gendarmerie said left some 20 people dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gendarmerie said they slipped over the border from Zaire, where thousands of Burundian Hutus are living as refugees, travelling via Bihanga, 20 kilometres north of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their targets had been the houses of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the eastern suburb of Mutanga, the city's most luxurious neighbouring, where many government ministers and parliamentarians live, and the southern quarter of Kanyosah, the gendarmerie said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rumours had circulated on December 6 of a possible coup d'etat, with clashes around the residence of Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who was in Paris, but these were discounted the following day as calm returned to the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1993 assassination of president Melchior Ndadaye in a failed military putsch sparked fighting in which some 50,000 Burundians died, and continuous ethnic clashes and massacres since then have raised fears that Burundi will slide into full-scale civil war similar to that in neighbouring Rwanda last year, during which Hutu extremists killed between 500,000 and one million men, women and children before being defeated by a Tutsi rebel army made up mostly of men who had been living in neighbouring Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hutus make up 85 per cent of Burundi's population -- the same percentage as in pre-war Rwanda -- but the armed forces, who have chased most Hutus out of Bujumbura, are almost exclusively Tutsi and are virtually independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of Hutus have fled the country, but Hutu militiamen carry out frequent attacks in the capital, withdrawing afterwards to the surrounding mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An attack on a bus on December 6 in the northern suburb of Cibitoke by uniformed men was reported to have left eight people dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the United States claimed on December 8 that 430 people, 90 per cent of them women and children, were massacred near Bujumbura on November 14, and urged the need to promote reconciliation in Burundi to end the ethnic violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the massacre took place at Basarara, near the Burundi capital. At the same time, MSF also claimed on December 11 that some 40,000 people have been killed in ethnic unrest so far this year, 40 per cent of them women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For every one person wounded in the violence, 10 are killed, most of them civilians, MSF spokesman Lucas Van den Broek told a news conference in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Over the past few weeks the situation has become even more critical.  Violence is spiralling and the lack of interest from the international community is no longer acceptable,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ARUSHA DECEMBER 19 - The Rwanda War Crimes Tribunal charged eight people with genocide on December 12, issuing its first indictments relating to last year's ethnic bloodbath that left between 500,000 and one million people dead, but did not name any of the suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The clerk of the international tribunal, Dr. Andronico Adede of Kenya, said the indictments concerned massacres at four sites in Rwanda's southwestern Kibuye area between April and June 1994 during a bitter civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The indictments allege that this conspiracy (caused) literally the death of tens of thousands of men, women and children,&quot; most of them minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus, Adede said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Five suspects were charged with genocide and crimes against humanity, while all eight were charged with conspiring to commit genocide. Other indictments were expected to follow shortly against suspects held in Belgium and Zambia, the head of the UN-appointed tribunal, South African judge Richard Goldstone said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Other key developments will follow shortly,&quot; he declared, and said that he is working on the basis of about 400 suspects, but stressed that their names were not drawn from lists of &quot;criminals&quot; some observers have attributed to the post-war regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I intend to make an application on January 10 seeking the deferral of investigations involving four suspects currently being held by the Belgian authorities,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goldstone also said his office would begin mass grave exhumations in January in connection with the initial indictment. The chief prosecutor had stated last month that he would reveal the names of those charged on December 12, but after consultations, Navanethem Pillay, one of the six trial judges, ordered that identities should not be revealed until further notice. The South African judge said the tribunal did not want to make it easier for suspects to evade arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three lawyers attending the proceeding - a Belgian, an Ivorian and a Kenyan -- to represent exiled Rwandan Hutu refugees, said that to name those indicted would be tantamount to launching a political trial. Hundreds of potential suspects are sheltering among the refugees, many of them in Zaire, as well as among the refugee community in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tribunal was created by the UN Security Council in November 1994 and set up operations in Tanzania to try those charged with involvement in the ethnic carnage. Goldstone said a date for trials depended on the cooperation of the countries concerned, but the trial of suspects already in detention could begin between six and eight weeks after indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of the genocide has been blamed on Rwandan Hutu extremists accused of embarking on revenge killings after the death of Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana when his plane was shot down on April 6, 1994, also killing president Cyprien Ntaryamira of neighbouring Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civil war ended in July 1994 when the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) seized power in Kigali. More than two million Hutus -- about a quarter of the pre-war population -- fled to neighbouring countries and have refused to go home for fear of reprisals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Troops of the RPF have also been accused of human rights violations, even of large-scale massacres, that according to some Rwandans are continuing. The charges, which have not been independently verified, have been denied by the Rwandan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tribunal's mandate is restricted to crimes committed between January 1 and December 31, 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KIGALI - Rwanda is expelling 38 Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) because they have &quot;failed in their mission,&quot; the country's Rehabilitation Ministry announced December 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several key French organisations, including the Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) medical aid agency, and Aide Internationale Contre la Faim (AICF)/International Aid Agency against Hunger) were on the list of groups ordered to quit the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministry said the NGOs had displayed a &quot;lack of experience&quot; and failed &quot;to adapt to the criteria necessary for an intervention in Rwanda,&quot; and further accused some of the agencies of &quot;not obeying the rules&quot; set by the Rwandan authorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And 18 other NGOs have been told to &quot;provisionally suspend&quot; their activities while their cases were being examined, leaving another 102 accredited bodies to continue their activities normally, the ministry added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the more serious cases, the ministry specified, some agencies had &quot;abandoned children in orphanages&quot; or &quot;sold food intended as humanitarian aid on the open market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanda is still in the process of recovery from a genocidal civil war which left between 500,000 and one million people dead in a three- month period last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kigali regime, dominated by former rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), has recently increased its criticism of France for its support of the former Hutu regime of Juvenal Habyarimana and also voiced increasing hostility to French policies in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Rehabilitation Ministry said its decision had not been motivated by political considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The expulsions come amid an eruption of a major dispute between the Rwandan government and the United Nations over the role of UN peacekeepers in the tiny war-torn central African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 9, the Rwandan government threatened to terminate the mandate of the UN peacekeeping force operating in the country if the UN Security Council refuses to reduce its troop strength and insists on maintaining the strength of the force above 1,400 men, the government-owned Rwanda Radio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mandate of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) - which was due to end at midnight on December 8, was saved in last-minute discussions at the UN Security Council in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An extension until December 12 brought diplomats at the UN another few days to work out how many UN peacekeepers should remain. UN planners believe that the organisation cannot maintain an effective force below a minimum of 1,400 men from its more than 2,000 peacekeepers currently serving in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tutsi-dominated government has an uneasy relationship with UN peacekeepers in the country since they watched powerlessly as more than 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred by extremists from the Hutu majority during the 1994 civil war. The war ended with the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front seizing power in July last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomats at the UN in New York will be hoping to reach a compromise on a revised mandate with the government before the new deadline ends on December 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another development, Rwanda's former intelligence chief has accused his home government of slaughtering more than 300,000 Hutus in the last civil war. &quot;I accuse the RPF of crimes of genocide against the ethnic Hutu population, and of ethnic cleansing and I am calling for an urgent inquiry,&quot; Sixbert Musangamfura said in a statement released in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu made a similar accusation last month, but both were denied by Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Musangamfura, like the former premier, had worked with the new government up to last August.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cairo - Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak named six Coptic Christians to Egypt's new parliament on December 11 after their community failed to win a seat in general elections, the official Middle East News Agency (MENA) said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the two-round legislative vote for 444 seats completed on December 6, Mubarak appointed 10 more deputies to the People's Assembly. His ruling party won 416 seats in an election plagued by violence and charges of fraud. Only 14 opposition members took seats, while the remaining 14 were taken by independents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president's appointments were all pro-government figures, including three women, two of them Coptic Christians and the other a Muslim. Five other women won contested seats in the election, bringing the total in the new parliament to eight, two less than the outgoing body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president traditionally uses his appointments to give seats to women and Christians, who rarely win in the general elections. Some 25 Christians ran in the latest polls but none won seats. Coptic Patriarch Pope Shenuda III criticised the ruling National Democratic Party for not entering a single Christian candidate in the race. Officially, Christians make up around 10 per cent of the country's 50 million-plus population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition and human rights groups accused the government of massive fraud during the vote and have called for fresh elections under international supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 10, Egypt's top administrative court postponed until December 18 a ruling on whether to cancel vote results in almost a quarter of seats won in the newly-elected parliament because of alleged fraud. More than 100 appeals were lodged against the results of two rounds of elections held on November 29 and December 6, citing vote rigging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties and human rights groups had called for the dissolution of parliament and the holding of new elections, saying the government used vote rigging to bar them from the assembly. But legal sources said the court was likely to pass judgement that only parliament itself has the right to rule on the legality of its elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Centre for Human Rights Legal Aid (CHRLA) also condemned in its report widespread fraud by police and the state during the two rounds of voting, saying it meant &quot;the destruction of the democratic system&quot;.Opposition and rights groups have called for a new election, blaming fraud for the crushing victory of the NDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CHRLA called the NDP majority &quot;illogical&quot;, saying the results &quot;reflect the government's refusal of the principle of peaceful disagreement with it and of the people's right to remove the standing government. The group also called for a new law giving the supreme court the right to decide appeals against elections, since legal scholars now generally put that right in the hands of parliament itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A parliament which has such a sweeping majority of the ruling party cannot be expected to decide on the legitimacy of its members in an independent and impartial way,&quot; the CHRLA said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS - The head of the Anglican Church in Nigeria on December 11 called on the country's military ruler General Sani Abacha to step down and hand over power to the jailed opposition leader Chief Moshood Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The call from Rev. Joseph Abiodun Adetiloye was made in response to a statement in which military ruler Abacha reportedly said that neither the Nigerian people nor external pressure could force his government out of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Power belongs to God alone. He gives it out and takes it back at His pleasure,&quot; reminded Adetiloye.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a highly critical letter published here by the independent Guardian newspaper, the cleric urged Abacha's regime to abandon its three-year transition programme towards democracy and install Chief Abiola in power instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola, a Muslim millionaire businessman, is presumed to have won a presidential election held on June 12, 1993, and later annulled by the military and is currently being detained on charges of treason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adetiloye said that if the regime was &quot;anxious....not to be disgraced out of office, it must forget its three-year transition programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last October 1, General Abacha announced a transition programme that is scheduled to culminate in the military handing over power to an elected president on October 1, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All lovers of peace in Nigeria should urge Western powers for a &quot;Camp David&quot; or &quot;Lancaster House type&quot; conference which should lead to the withdrawal of the military and installation of a national government, headed by Chief Abiola, without further delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Camp David Accord, signed in 1978, was the prelude to the peace accord between Israel and Egypt while conferences at Lancaster House in London led to the independence of Nigeria in 1960, Kenya in 1963 and that of Zimbabwe in 1980. All the steps Abacha has taken so far, are &quot;like those of the captain of a sinking ship. These panicky measures impress no one, but himself,&quot; Adetiloye added. The Anglican church head, a prominent and respected religious leader in the country, has in the past year written several letters to the military authorities urging them to quit power and install Chief Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adetiloye's outbursts against the Nigerian military came as human rights and minority groups in Nigeria declared Sunday, December 10, the United Nations Human Rights Day, a day of mourning for Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight executed companions.The Organisation for the Protection of the Niger Delta from Environmental and Allied Degradation (OPNEAD) said that the struggle for which Saro-Wiwa, a writer, and his colleagues were executed on November 10 in Port Harcourt, capital of the southern Rivers State, would continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement received here on December 10, the OPNEAD said that it had lined up a week-long programme, beginning December 10 with a 'stay-at-home' action by all peace-loving people of the Niger Delta area to mourn those executed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ken Saro-Wiwa was the president of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), a body fighting against marginalisation of the oil-rich Ogoni community and destruction of its eco-system by foreign oil companies, particularly Shell.<BR>A peaceful demonstration was scheduled for December 11 in all the major cities in the Niger Delta area, while on December 16, a ceremony to mark the &quot;mock suspension&quot; of oil exploration and exploitation in the area would be organised in Bonny, one of the main cities in Rivers State, according to the text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organisation also called for &quot;urgent&quot; imposition of an oil embargo on Nigeria in protest against the executions, which triggered a flurry of local and international condemnations and sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Southern Minorities Movement, a body which claims to represent minorities in five oil-producing states of Nigeria, also set aside December 10 as a day of mourning by indigenous people of these states for Saro-Wiwa and his companions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), in a statement, urged Nigerians to use World Human Rights Day to &quot;rededicate ourselves for the struggle for the termination of military rule at all cost&quot; following the military's &quot;unprecedented violations&quot; of the economic, social, political and cultural rights of Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement signed by the body's secretary-general, Jiti Ogunye, urged the UN to use its December 11 session on Nigeria to enjoin its member-nations to impose oil, arms, trade and sports embargoes on this West African country and visa restriction on all military officers and their relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the executions, the Commonwealth suspended Nigeria from its fold while the United States and European Union clamped arms embargoes on Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - As Santa Claus rides in a reindeer through the snow in a one horse open sleigh to deliver dainties in the night and slip them under the mistletoe in the North, some parts of Africa will fell trees by the numbers and adorn them with snow-balls and small lights. Everyone will know it is Christmas. The Christmas tree tradition has over the years become an integral part of the end-of-year decoration euphoria in many parts of the world. But in Ethiopia, where 90 per cent of the population is Christian and is affiliated mainly to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, conservation of trees particularly at this time of the year is an important issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a time when Ethiopia's Transitional Government is completely pre-occupied with putting up political structures towards a favourable Federal State, environment and development issues are shelved for a later time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is with the aim of filling this gap that Lem, a Non-Governmental Organisation has prioritised working on environmental resource conservation.  Lem facilitates discussions among 350 high school clubs and 250 peasant farmers' associations, and acts as partners with these groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We realised in our operations as a network that an important entry-point to community outreach is the Ethiopian Orthodox Church,&quot; says Asseged Bezabih a Programme Coordinator with Lem. Ethiopia records centuries of the Christian tradition. Monasteries and churches, 30,000 of them in all, have promoted the protection of trees mainly through strict adherence to planting of dense woods around the Church throughout the years. The practice has been a combination of Christian beliefs and elements of traditional African cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditionally, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church holds to an uncompromising belief that a church or monastery must be heavily surrounded by trees. All churches must also have graveyards to bury members and these are used for purposes of conservation of nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In many cases, the Church easily acquires permission from the Government to extend its own acreage owing to respect and fear of God and priesthood.  Lem has assisted in expanding the wooded areas by having the priests ask for government support for more land and thus extension of forests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Mr. Bezabih, this practice favours conservation of species of trees and brush that would have long ago gone extinct. It is attributed to the priests who have played a great role in ensuring trees' preservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No one is allowed to touch trees surrounding a church or a monastery.&quot; Says Mr. Bezabih. He adds that forests have been preserved as a result of a belief that the angel of the Church resides there and are therefore sacred.  This belief parallels the sacred groves depicted in many African traditional cultures. Trees are thus revered and at this time of the year, priests remind Ethiopians through the media not to cut them for Christmas because it is not a biblically-oriented practice. &quot;Nowhere in the Bible does it say that to remember the birth of Jesus Christ, one must have decorated trees in the Church or in the home,&quot; says Rahel, also a member of Lem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The activities of Lem in this regard are an important step to the on-going disappearance of world's forests. According to data provided by a United Nations environmental statistician, Thomas Mpofu during a workshop in Harare Zimbabwe recently, forests are disappearing at an alarming rate of between 14 million and 20 million hectares a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The greatest losses that account for up to 62 per cent are taking place in dryland south of the Sahara, as well as in East and South- East Africa. At least 60,000 of the approximately 265,000 plant species in the world are in danger of extinction. Through involvement in church activities, Lem disseminates environment and development related information to members, an activity that is sanctioned by the priesthood. During church meetings, issues of importance to the members are raised and these have become useful fora for discussion of environmental concerns. The 4,000-member network spreads out all over Ethiopia and is planning an outreach programme for the non-Christian community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The African Church of the Holy Spirit (ACOHS) is a church with a difference. Not only does time cease to exist when the motto of the church, the &quot;Spirit and the Bible&quot;, grips adherents but the day's agenda also joins the list of dispensable appendages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And with heel-long white flowing robes, white turbans which often conceal waist-long dreadlocks, and symbolic red crosses on their robes, African Church of the Holy Spirit faithful are a sight to behold for any first time visitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Church has more surprises in store. Its prayer sessions sometimes last upto three hours, with the congregation liberally talking in tongues, singing hilariously and dancing energetically &quot;for the Lord&quot;. &quot;One does not need to go to a disco after our evening prayer meetings,&quot; joked Gilbert Lijina, 28.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lijina, a primary school teacher in western Kenya where the ACOHS has its headquarters at Lugala, some 450 kilometers north-western of Nairobi has been a member of the church from childhood. &quot;I can't remember when I joined the church. But I must have been very young, my mother brought me,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like most other adherents when &quot;the spirit and Bible&quot; motto is upon the church, Lijina abandons himself to the care of the Holy Spirit, talking in tongues, sometimes leaping high up in the air and often falling down and rolling on the ground. &quot;I have never known this to hurt anyone,&quot; he told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He conceded he felt very calm afterwards. &quot;A strange calmness like I were living in a different world. You can't understand until you allow the Holy Spirit to take control of your life,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lijina is quite sure that the Holy Spirit guides him on a daily basis.  &quot;I always feel the presence of God and the guiding hand of the Holy Spirit in whatever I do,&quot; he said. So does Enock Kanjie Mayo, 55. Mayo, a father of six who hails from Cheptuyiet, Nandi district in Kenya's Rift Valley Province said he joined ACOHS in 1965. He put it very clear that, &quot;I will never leave this church.&quot; Why? &quot;Because it is a compass for my life. Without it I would not know how to live, I would not even care to live,&quot; he told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kanjie admits that he often encounters problems from people who do not understand his devotion to guidance by the Holy Spirit. &quot;My elder brother makes cruel jokes about me always. He often refers to me as a mad man and pointing to my turban greets me; Goodmorning old woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is Kanjie bitter with his brother? &quot; Not at all. He does not know what he says, he does not what he is living for and so I always forgive him,&quot; explained Kanjie philosophically.<BR>The only time Kanjie has been to hospital since he joined the ACOHS 30 years ago was when he was forcibly dragged there by the police in 1970 after some machine he was working on almost severed his thumb. &quot;But I ran away after only two days.&quot; And showing a well healed thumb for all to see he adds, &quot;through prayer, the thumb healed very fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps where the Africa Church of the Holy Spirit locks horns with its critics is on its stand on medical treatment. Founders of the ACOHS openly disapproved of hospital visits. However, today the church is of a different opinion. Said High Priest Hezekiah Timothy Shitsimi; &quot;In earlier days members were not allowed by the Holy Spirit to go to hospital but relied on faith in the Lord to cure any disease. Today, members weaker in faith are allowed to seek medical care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High Priest Shitsimi, a father of five sons and grandfather to 15, says he has never been to hospital for treatment since he joined the church some 44 years ago. &quot;Not that I have not been ill all these years, all I do when I become sick is entrust my sickness to God through prayer,&quot; he told this writer. The church has a group of elders who pray for people and lay hands on them in such difficult circumstances as during illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High Priest Shitsimi, like his church, is a most striking personality.  He wears a well kept beard and says he has not shaved his hair since 1951.  With his flowing white and red gown carrying his ramrod straight bearing and cross-shaped staff, Shitsimi bears an uneasy resemblance to prophets of the Old Testament. Yet his church is sharply both old and modern. Its spacious building at the Lugala Headquarters in Western Kenya measures upto other modern churches the world over. Yet it has no pews save a few seats reserved for the leadership of the church. The pulpit is out of bounds for the laity and parallel lines running across the length of the church clearly divide male adherents from their female counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worshippers leave their shoes outside the church because &quot;the church is a holy place. The Holy Spirit showed founders ways of worship, different from the established Friends Church, (Quakers)&quot; said High Priest Shitsimi. This apparently includes an allowance of 30 minutes or so for people to report their revelations after prayer sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African Church of the Holy Spirit has a membership of 500,000 followers spread across the three East African countries of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.  One of the earliest African Independent Churches, ACOHS broke away from the Quakers in 1927 and has since kept growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To outsiders ACOHS has a number of other surprises. There is no baptism by water, only by acceptance and the Holy Spirit. Rings and elaborate (expensive) gowns are no requirements for the solemnizing of weddings for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking of wedding rings, Shitsimi described the bands as &quot;things of this world. They do not bind a marriage. A willing bride, a willing bridegroom and God's hand are all it takes to sustain a living marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the church is as forward-looking and gender sensitive as any other modern church. Shitsimi is very hopeful that sponsors will be found to help educate ACOHS's clergy. The church, with assistance from the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) is training two ladies in Bachelor of Divinity courses at the St. Paul's United Theological College in Nairobi. Locally, the ACOHS is a member of the NCCK and on the global level a member of the Geneva-based World Council of Churches (WCC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Pastor John Akhura, who obtained his Bachelor of Divinity degree from the St. Paul's College insisted that ACOHS &quot;is as progressive as any other church today.&quot; Referring to ACOHS as &quot;a charismatic church that recognises the Holy Spirit, he noted that the church, like any other, is changing with the times. &quot;However, like any other reputable church, we are trying very hard to keep our tradition too. Every church must have a tradition, an identity. When a church looses identity it becomes secular and has nothing original to offer its people,&quot; concluded Rev. Akhura.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>December 19, 1995<BR>by APS Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - One of the biggest problems with Western media reporting on Africa is the stereotyping of Africa as a continent of misery, Aids, perennial hunger and famines, military and parasitic governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a practical approach to the problem of negative attitudes about Africa in the West, the Inter-Church coalition on Africa (ICCA), an affiliate of the Canadian Council of Churches has been working to sentitise American and Canadian editors, NGOs, church workers and others on how to avoid stereotyping Africa and thus improve the image of a continent that is dynamic but badly misrepresented in the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have published a pamphlet guideline entitled Imaging Africa-A guideline for Fair and Just Representation on Africa, which is clear and concise on what should be done to overcome the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two Nairobi-based church organisations, All Africa Press Service, and the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) were associated with the production of these guidelines. The Southern Africa Research and Documentation Centre (SARDC) was also consulted in the formation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pamphlet underscores that much of the news and information that Canadians and Americans receive about African countries today, consists of written and visual images of people who are hungry; people who are poor; people who are victims of injustice war, or violence or who are devastated by natural calamities like the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in a refreshing observation, the ICCA asserts: &quot;Yet Africa in all its multi-national multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi- religious diversity, is so much more than this very limited portrayal suggests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conceding that suffering is part of the reality of African countries as indeed the rest of the world, the ICCA says this is not the total picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To isolate and sensationalise the more violent and chaotic aspects of the events in African countries, as is often done, is to demean the dignity, self worth and resourcefullness of the people who live there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are numerous positive human qualities and traits that deserve to be affirmed. Stereotyping Africa assumes many forms. The inter-church coalition group has listed four most common errors that it would like corrected. Categorizing Africa as the homogenous continent, the group notes that People often speak about Africa as a single country and as if its people were of a single race and culture. Far from it. &quot;The African continent is home to 53 countries each of which is diverse in terms of ethnicity, culture and religion. Every major racial grouping on earth is represented in Africa,&quot; says the ICCA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nder coups and calamities, the ICCA says much of what is reported revolves around coups and calamities. The many success stories - dictators ousted through democratic means, ethnic conflicts resolved through peaceful indigenous mediation, local efforts to overcome poverty, for example - are more often than not ignored or down played.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to the assumption of inferiority, the coalition group notes that one common message implicit in many news reports in various forms of advertising is that Africans are inferior to people in the West, and dependent on Western handouts. Sadly this assumption is found even in well meaning attempts by charitable organisations to raise funds for their relief and development work in Africa. &quot;Emotionally charged images of starving children may help raise money but often they obscure the underlying causes of hunger and poverty and foster patronising stereotype of Africans as helplessly dependent on Western aid and support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ICCA believes emergency relief is important. However the group is of the opinion that the prime target of Western largesse &quot;should be exposing and addressing the root causes of, rather than seeking temporary solutions to problems that require long term care and attention to heal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, the church-coalition group describes the &quot;Primitive African&quot; as the common tendency in Western documentary news and popular cultural expression to portray African life as primitive. It says this tendency thrives today &quot;and results in Africans being seen as barbarians or naive children frozen in pre-modern conditions.&quot; The effect of this approach is to demean African cultural traditions &quot;which are no less valid than the traditions of people of European or other heritage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ICCA says no simple formula exists to guarantee the fair and just representation of African people and events. Some of the guidelines are here summarised; Coverage of African events needs to be broadened and increased; One third of the world's population is in Africa; There are usually extenuating circumstances underlying the outbreak of wars and famines in Africa. It is not all due to &quot;tribal rivalries&quot; and may infact have their roots in colonialism and global policies of northern countries; News media should balance reporting on Africa because there are many success stories to be found; News media should make better use of African sources of news and information and seek an African interpretation of African events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For NGOs that rely on images of hungry and poor Africans to raise funds, it is important to explore alternate fund raising appeals that affirm and preserve the dignity of Africans.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>December 19, 1995<BR>by Sam Gonza</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Throughout Africa south of the Sahara, the desert strip that separates the predominantly Muslim North from the largely Christian South, Christmas is a delightful period of celebration with colour dance, song, meals and prayer. Even in war ravaged Southern Sudan where people do with incredibly meagre resources, many Christians start to prepare for Christmas several weeks in advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides bringing hope to people in Africa, like a rejuvenation before the New Year, the Christmas season is also the best example of inculturated Gospel in action, says Father Joseph Healey, 58, a Maryknoll Missioner from Detroit, Michigan, who first came to Africa in the late fifties. Well versed in African traditions and the way African culture relates to the Gospel, he is the author of the metaphorically titled The Fifth Gospel a compiled narrative on how God continues to reveal Himself in the local environment in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through his study of African traditions, cultural practices, proverbs, oral literature and song, Fr. Healey has become convinced that inculturating the Gospel - rendering the Good News of Jesus Christ in an African idiom - is the best way forward in evangelising the continent in the millennium and beyond.<BR>The Pope himself, during his tour of Africa last September, called Africa the continent of the future. He made a strong plea to African Bishops to pursue the challenge of inculturating the Gospel with vigour. &quot;Jesus Christ Himself is an African...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Healey asserts again: &quot;The way people in Africa take their local symbols and songs and incorporate them into the Christmas liturgy and celebration is just wonderful.&quot; He tells the story of his own experiences among the Kuria ethnic group of Musoma Diocese in northwestern Tanzania, a story he has incorporated in his forthcoming book, &quot;I Pointed Out the Stars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In your imagination, travel to Kiagata Parish in Musoma Diocese. Three days before Christmas, an African Christmas Hut (the traditional Christmas Crib in the form of a small African Hut) is prepared in the sanctuary of the church. Within this small African Hut, figurines of tall shepherds with their cows and sheep portray a pastoral scene that is close to the hearts of the rural farming community in Kiagata. Bright red, green and yellow African cloths hang from the ceiling. Long cords hold rows of pictures and cards (much as in the West). On Christmas eve afternoon, the carved figures of Mary and Joseph are placed in the open hut, &quot;tired&quot; after their long journey from Nazareth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Christmas liturgy begins at 9 p.m. (Christmas eve). The priest reads the Gospel of Luke in Swahili (the principal lingua franca in East Africa).  &quot;She gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for him in the inn.&quot; The priest stops.<BR>In a small procession with candles, an altar boy reverently carries the carved figure of the infant Jesus and places him in the manger. There is no electricity in the church, but the flickering candles dramatically highlight the manger scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then a wave of singing clapping and drumming reverberates through the church. From the back of the church, a group of men and women of the Kuria tribe rhythmically dance forward to the beat of shakers and drums. Healey says the song they sing &quot;We Come to the Home of the Child&quot; is their traditional song, which they have always sung from time immemorial to welcome a new born baby in the village. As they dance in front of the African Christmas Hut the women and girls trill with joy. A sea of trilling and joyful excitement sweeps through the whole church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the singing and dancing, the priest finishes reading the Gospel and they all sing a popular Swahili version of the Christmas song. &quot;The Lord Jesus Christ Has Been Born. It is Certain.&quot; A Christmas pageant play can be performed after the second reading, after the Gospel, or after the night Eucharist itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a Swahili saying Children are a blessing. Healey explains that children are a new life, a great value in African society. &quot;A mother giving birth is a joyful community event. There is an African custom of visiting the newborn infant in his or her home. Visitors bring gifts of money, flour, soap and eggs. As a religious parallel, Christians visit the African Christmas Hut in Church and leave a small donation to honour the Christ Child.&quot;<BR>In Mathew's Gospel, the Maggi offer the Christ Child gold, frankincense and myrrh which are symbols of wealth and divine worship in the Middle East culture. But what symbols would African people choose?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A catechist of the Logir ethnic group in Torit Diocese of southern Sudan says the gifts would be a goat which is a symbol of royalty and wealth, a spear which is a symbol of defence and healing and a small flexible stick which is the symbol of power. The Ganda people of Uganda would give the Christ Child a drum which is the symbol of kingship and authority, a spear which is the symbol of defence and protection and a bark cloth (a coarse deep brown fabric crafted traditionally from the bark of certain trees) which is a symbol of royal investiture.<BR>The Kuria people would give a goat for the mother, flour for food and ghee (from milk) to shine up the baby. Observes Healey: &quot;In African tradition it is very important to give a special gift to the mother of Jesus.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - TheHigh Court has ruled that the police had, through the Public Order Act, violated the rights of assembly of Post Newspaper editor-in-Chief Fred M'me- mbe when he and his associates were denied a permit to protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the court remained silent on whether the act was in conflict with the Constitution and should be struck down altogether. In a judgement delivered in Ndola yesterday, Justice Lombe Chibesakunda ruled that police had violated M'membe's freedom to assemble and associate by denying him and his associates a permit to protest the arrest of now-Malawian second Vice President Chakufwa Chihana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe worked with Chihana, and other Malawians, in early 1992 to form Malawi's Alliance For Democracy (AFORD) and its then mouth piece The Malawian Democrat newspaper.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the application, M'membe wanted to hold the demonstration condemning the arrest of Chihana who had just returned from Zambia where he participated in the launch AFORD. &quot;They applied for a permit. Police agreed to grant it but the following day they refused. University of Zambia students who went ahead to protest were arrested,&quot; said John Sangwa, Mmembe's lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The permit was later granted on a different day on the intervention of then Inspector General Darius Kalebo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court has also ordered the state to pay damages and costs of the legal<BR>action.  Judge Chibesakunda's ruling will provide relief to opposition parties and<BR>civic organisations who have in the past been denied permits by police to<BR>march or assemble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am happy that the court has found that my rights were violated. I don't see myself come into direct conflict with the Public Order Act as a journalist, but I hope this judgement will put pressure on the police not to deny people permits anyhow,&quot; an elated M'membe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judgement has been welcomed by UNIP chairman Malimba Masheke whose party has been a victim in the past. Masheke hoped the police will take this as a signal not to be influenced by those in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The judgement by Chibesakunda is as it should be. I am not a lawyer but I know what my rights are. I hope we can have such judgements which stand upright. Chibesakunda's judgement is in the right direction. We need judges who will interpret law as they know it,&quot; Masheke said in a telephone interview yesterday, adding: &quot;Police must now move away from being dictated<BR>by interested parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FODEP secretary and spokesman Bishop John Mambo said in any civilised society &quot;people have a right to tell their governments what they want&quot;. He welcomed Chibesakunda's judgement because &quot;denial of permits brings a lot of problems&quot;. He called for the review of the Public Order Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When judges start awarding ordinary people whose rights have been violated we are now seeing the judiciary at work. Chibesakunda's judgement is what is right and will assist in making the judiciary autonomous,&quot; Mambo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe's lawyer John Sangwa, however, said his client wanted the court to deal with the constitutionality of the act and for it to be be struck off. &quot;We petitioned the court that M'membe's rights were violated on the day he and his associates wanted to protest march. We were seeking a declaration that these rights to freely assemble and associate were violated by the existence, in our statute books, of the Public Order Act,&quot; Sangwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The petition implored the court to declare section five of the Public Order Act which requires one to obtain a permit to organise any public meeting or procession unconstitutional. He also argued that the section placed a prior restraint on the enjoyment of that freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The judge avoided making such a declaration,&quot; Sangwa said, adding: &quot;I have been given instructions to appeal to the Supreme Court because the court failed to address the constitutionality of section 5 of the Act,&quot; Sangwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But asked why he was appealing against the judgement he described as a landmark M'membe said: &quot;I am appealing because I didn't go to court for money or compensation of any sort, but to ask the court to strike down this legislation and in particular section 5 of the Public Order Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said it was important in a democracy to enjoy your rights when you want<BR>to and not to be arbitrarily regulated.  &quot;The Public Order Act is unreasonable in a democratic society because it controls one's enjoyment of his rights.  It is also open to abuse as it has been proved in many situations. Since Judge Chibesakunda failed to address the question I have no choice but to appeal to the Supreme Court,&quot; M'membe said. &quot; But I highly appreciate and recognise the great advancement made in her ruling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Director of Elections Rabson Mwansa admitted the voters registration<BR>exercise which began on December 12 has been poor due to lack of publicity.  Mwansa said in an interview on Tuesday that the exercise was going on slowly due to poor publicity, especially in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said his department has since released K55 million to Zambia Information Services for publicity throughout the country. &quot;Publicity will be conducted in all areas because some people were not aware that the process had started,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The process has been slow because some people did not even know what it means though they have been hearing about it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwansa expressed hope that the exercise would &quot;pick up &quot;after extensive publicity because all other logistics had been put in place. But press liaison officer at the elections office, Joel Sikazwe, contradicted his claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We had mounted enough publicity,&quot; Sikazwe said in an interview yesterday. &quot;The department has done its best in informing the public on the exercise through the media but the turnout was still poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile some polling officers have joined the call to mount a door-to-door campaign in the registration exercise for it to yield results. A polling officer who declined to be named at one of the stations in Lusaka claimed yesterday that he had tried the door-to door exercise and it proved very effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I had only registered one person from morning to midday but after I left the station and went door-to-door in the afternoon, I registered fifty-one people within a very short time,&quot; he claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Sikazwe ruled out the idea saying the Electoral act did not provide for such mechanism. He also announced that the same registration centres will be used as polling stations during elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba yesterday retained his presidency of the ruling MMD after overwhelmingly defeating former republican vice-president, and out-going party vice president, Levy Mwanawasa. There were deafening roars of joy from the gathered cadres as elections officials announced that Chiluba had 1087 votes against Mwanawasa's 69.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mwanawasa though acknowledging defeat in a telephone interview from his home yesterday said he would maintain silence at least for the moment. &quot;I have lost but I am not saying anything at the moment,&quot; Mwanawasa said, adding: &quot;I want to remain mute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MMD campaign manager Dipak Patel in an interview yesterday afternoon said: &quot;The elections have been extremely peaceful and gone according to the way they were planned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Patel, however, added: &quot;There was a little mix-up when some delegates<BR>who initially were given up because of late coming, but eventually turned up, otherwise everything has been fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cadres were yesterday given an afternoon off in order to prepare for a reception hosted for them at State House by President Chiluba.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 22, 1995<BR>by Jon Swift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - This has been a momentous year for rugby in this country.  World Cup champions and unbeaten in 14 tests, the Amabokoboko have swept all before them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national euphoria which greeted the 15-12 win in the Ellis Park final over New Zealand was a shot in the arm for a nation suffering from the inferiority complex of seeing just how wide and wicked the world really is after decades of blinkered isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was Joel Stransky's extra time drop goal which etched the words &quot;South Africa&quot; on the William Webb-Ellis Trophy, the squad which had got him there and the hearts of a nation which had willed them on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The slogan &quot;One team, One country&quot;, which had been the adopted rallying cry at the start of a campaign, perhaps more in hope than expectation by all but coach Kitch Christie, who had said we would win from the start, took on the added significance of momentary reality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was Bokke Bo! in the most effusive and concrete way possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even President Mandela wore the leaping Springbok and the green and gold. And Archbishop Tutu -- as unlikely a candidate as a lock forward you probably couldn't hope to find -- walked the streets of Cape town in a national rugby jersey which reached down almost as far as his more accustomed ecumenical robes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Francois Pienaar, Chester Williams, Andre Joubert, Joost van der Westhiuzen, Ruben Kruger and Stransky have rightly been identified as figures of global status in the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So too has Christie. An intensely private man who shuns personal publicity, he has often proved to be one of the more thoughtful and incisive world coaches by applying logic to an often illogical game and insisting that his side play to their strengths rather than weakening their hand by playing to those of the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, Christie and his side reinforced against England at Twickenham in the most emphatic of manners, beating Jack Rowell's rearranged side 24-14 after a less than convincing warm-up Test against the Italians in Rome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The openly global nature of the game was also shown in Natal's French connection of Thierry Lacroix and Olivier Roumat, key components in bringing the Currie Cup back to Durban on a day ironically almost as drenched as that which saw the pair out of the World Cup in the scintillating semi-final against the South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The French selectors, as Gallically illogical as always, reacted by ruling both Lacroix and Roumat out of contention for the side to play two tests against the All Blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But to say that all is healthy in South African rugby would be to further paper over the cracks which began to appear almost as soon as Pienaar had handed back the gold champion's cup for safekeeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, in reality, was a year ruled more often by the chequebook than the referee's whistle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even before the game officially went professional in August, Louis Luyt had signed a R2-billion 10-year deal with media magnate Rupert Murdoch which effectively tied up the South African, New Zealand and Australian sides and all the top provincial line-ups in those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The northern hemisphere brokered a similar deal for R1-billion over five years. Currently they are negotiating to have this increased to R1,5-billion over the same period and, when it comes time for renegotiating for the following five, will likely have got a far better deal than Luyt, bringing the haste with which the southern hemisphere deal was signed into focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Sanzar -- the acronym made up of the three major nations party to the Murdoch millions -- did not take the players either into account or their confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Luyt pointed out at the time, other money -- most notably that of Murdoch's arch rival Kerry Packer -- was being dangled as tempting bait for players in the championship squad. Pienaar had even been acting as a Packer agent for the players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first signs of discontent with rugby's Winter Palace came with an uprising among the senior members of the Transvaal squad. Having tasted the fruits of triumph -- and doubtless some rule-of-thumb auditing on World Cup crowds -- they effectively struck for better terms and conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Rugby Football Union, under Luyt's steely stewardship, acted and signed the World Cup players in a deal which effectively made them millionaires overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crisis had been averted for the time being, but it left the question of whether those enjoying the new largesse would share it with the new blood coming into the side ... or indeed continue to reap the rewards if they fell out of favour with the selectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, Gary Teichmann, who came in for one Test against the Welsh at Ellis Park only to be dropped for the tour of Italy and England, was not on the same package. Sarfu admitted as much at the time Teichmann gained his first cap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a singular and potentially terminal crack which remains embedded in the hastily poured foundations. There were others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The players at provincial level understood the larger implications of pay-for-play even if Sarfu did not. They formed a player's union asking for something close to the same kind of rights and privileges granted the national squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To an extent, Sarfu beggared the question by throwing the ball into the line-out of the provincial unions and then by placing restrictions on player movement to compensate for the less financially well-endowed provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Legal specialists are seemingly of a mind that the challenges will certainly come to the courts somewhere down the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the lawyers and agents will become increasingly important within the game. Such was the inference in the two cases involving Jacques Olivier and Christiaan Scholtz who signed forms for the rival rugby league code in Australia and then reneged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scholtz, who had signed to the overall league, was let off with no penalties. Olivier, who displaced James Small as wing partner for Williams in the starting line-up at Twickenham, was a different issue entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had signed directly to the club who then rightly demanded -- and got -- compensation when he turned down the contract he had so vehemently told the Springbok touring management did not exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The whole issue left a bitter taste and has done little to further the chances of other South Africans willing to switch codes in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the exodus to the Aussie dollar grew with Pieter Muller, Heinrich Fuls, Tiaan Strauss and Christian Stewart -- among others -- taking the gap offered by rugby league. There will -- so the insiders have us understand -- be others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A further concentrated move by the top strata of provincial players not lucky enough to have a contract with one of the big money unions will further weaken the domestic competition which saw Transvaal slide from the heights of two years ago to the status of sidelined also- rans this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transvaal reacted by moving the goalposts and reappointing Christie to run their provincial fortunes next season as well as handle the national side in a season which encompasses at the very least 11 internationals and effectively starts in the first week of January when training resumes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christie is a hard-working man. But the fact remains that he is only a single person. Somehow, this looks a retrogressive and illogical step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically though, any flood of players out of the game could give a boost to the somewhat underdeveloped development programme, bringing new blood through at an accelerated rate. Whether this will be good for the long-term health of the game is a moot point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it could slot -- albeit with some discomfort -- into Sarfu's dictum that teams below the national and senior interprovincial level will apply a system of affirmative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been a short year, an interesting and largely truimphant year.  The journey between this New Year and the next -- forget for a moment that we are only world champions until Cardiff in 1999 -- remains one that is not without a series of unseen potholes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 22, 1995<BR>by Jon Swift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - We re a nation of immense expectations, buoyed by the optimism which tends to flatten out the hills of the failures which are so inherently part of the human condition. In the realm of South African golf, thank heaven we are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have had any number of success stories within the boundaries of the game from the sons of our soil. Let us list just some of them:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Ernie Els winning the Byron Nelson Classic and defending the World Matchplay title.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Southern Africa comprehensively beating the Australasians in the inaugural Alfred Dunhill Challenge at Houghton.<BR>* Simon Hobday and Gary Player winning on the United States tour -- the ageless Player taking a title for the first time in two years.<BR>* Hendrik Buhrmann coming second in the European qualifying school -- no mean achievement -- and Roger Wessels starting the new year as a fully exempt player on the European Tour.<BR>* Nico van Rensburg winning in Asia and Ian Hutchings taking the Alberta Open title in Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of these deserve more respect than perhaps has been awarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At home though, things are not quite as rosy and the rapidly fragmenting face of professional touring golf in Southern Africa is not an entirely happy one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are now effectively five tours running. It is germane to examine what this means by looking at the way the structure pans out.<BR>* The three events tied to the European Tour -- the FNB Players Championship at Durban Country Club, the PGA at Houghton and the Dimension Data Pro-Am at Sun City -- must be taken as the top end as this is where the money and the television coverage is.<BR>* The remainder of the traditional FNB Tour, devastated by the withdrawal of sponsors unhappy with the paucity of focus and TV time.<BR>* The new Pro-Afrique Tour, worth about R2,5- million, which kicks off with a R100 000 event at Glendower on January 10 and encompasses 22 scheduled events.<BR>* The old Winter Tour, which will run a proposed 16 events alongside the 22 of the Pro-Afrique Tour, and is aimed at identifying the top players of the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conflict which exists between events with European Tour status and those withourt on the FNB Tour proper is self-evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conflict between the Winter and the Pro- Afrique Tours, both tied to the Order of Merit, is a shade more confusing. To illustrate this, take the case of the player presently 99th on the Order of Merit with R1 320 in season earnings. That player does not qualify for the Pro-Afrique event at Glendower and will have to make do with a Winter Tour tournament and around R1 400 for a top 10 finish. The player currently 101st on the same list with earnings of R1 127 for the season does qualify and stands to make R3 500 for a top 10 finish at Glendower. Somehow this does not add up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither does the development segment in the light of what happened to the one new sponsor during the course of this year. They put up R100 000 as a joint golf development and tourism booster in Mpumalanga, ran highly successful and popular caddie tournaments at 11 clubs in the region -- often with members reversing the roles and carrying the player's bags -- which culminated in a big pro-am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They approached the PGA's development division for some help only to be told that there was enough money through them without golf lending a hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tour Commissioner Brent Chalmers has also been left scratching his head.  Chalmers works on a strictly regulated cut of the sponsorship money which he is on record as saying is not realistic in that he is, perhaps, taking too much out of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is prepared to renegotiate downwards -- &quot;I'm even paying my own petrol already&quot; -- to put the cash back into the game rather than into the pockets his contract has opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chalmers has a problem. He can't get enough people who can count together to talk about this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the burgeoning tours, 1996 is the year that golf has to sit down and talk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 22, 1995<BR>by Jon Swift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - In attempting a retrospective of a turbulent year for tennis in this country, it is more apposite to look ahead than behind. This is not to discount the notable successes achieved by Wayne Ferreira -- twice winner over Pete Samparas -- and Amanda Coetzer as individuals and the Davis Cup team collectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With something akin to chaos reigning on the home front our players kept the brash colours of our new flag fluttering across the venues of the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yet in scanning a horizon that looks initially a lot less unforgiving than it did 12 months ago, some of the sins and omissions which have been visited on the sport have to be highlighted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mervyn King undertook an arduous one-man examination of tennis and, while all the findings will probably never be quoted chapter and verse, the sport and the nation owe the King Commission a debt beyond price for the work done by a man who has conquered the intricacies of both business and law, for the deciseveness and -- perhaps above all fairness and speed with which he completed this work.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tennis in this country had been stripped -- one way or another -- of virtually every asset. But most dangerously for the wellbeing of the game, tennis had lost the confidence of all involved: the administrators, the players and the sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> King changed that perception by forging a new base and on that base Terry Rosenberg was charged with rebuilding the crumbling edifice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be presumptuous to speculate on whether Rosenberg has aimed the odd kick at the family dog in the first weeks. He probably had more than ample cause. Yet outwardly he has approached the rebuilding process in the true spirit of masakane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rosenberg has instilled a new vibrancy and enthusiasm for the game, instilled his sense of humour which always bubbles just below the surface and brought a refreshing transparency and honesty into tennis. Witness to this was his reponse to a query about future plans. &quot;I don't know,&quot; he said with a trademark grin. &quot;I have still to get down and work on it.&quot; No equivocation or hedging, just a straight answer. This, you feel, is a man you can deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly the sponsors who had left the game in droves had the same feeling about the new chief executive. First came MTN putting up R10-million.  Then came the sporting goods giant Wilson with R5,4-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, in the true spirit of nation building, much of the money will go towards grassroots development, starting to set a parallel base to the new foundations laid for the administration which has sensibly encompassed some proven expertise. Alongside Rosenberg there are men of experience and quality like Gordon Forbes and Keith Brebnor, seconded from his job with the Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan authority to oversee the Davis Cup tie against Austria in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between them they convinced the International Tennis Federation's Davis Cup director Thomas Hallberg that the grass at Johannesburg's Wanderers will indeed provide a surface without the cloying qualities which made the tie against Australia in Durban such a shameful catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been a dynamic start to a new era, but to say that this is more than anything than just a start would be to gild a lily long left to wither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are signs that things are moving. Kevin Curran, the former Wimbledon finalist and Top Tenner now installed as a Davis Cup selector, made the point eloquently with his call for a return to the super squad system, enabling young players to experience the global nature of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The development of the sport at the top is as important as it is at the entry ring. A super squad would enable young players like Jeff Coetzee, a teenager from the disadvantaged far reaches of the northern Cape who started his careeer with a racquet cut from scrap wood, to really advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coetzee is just one of many and is chosen merely to show that the humble nature of a background and the initial lack of equipment or facilities can be overcome. It is with players like this young man that our future rests. This aspect, more than any other, is the job which faces Rosenberg and company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is an unenviable job, but at least, in the present South African context, it is being approached with humour, enthusiasm and most importantly with a growing amount of earned respect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 22, 1995<BR>by Jonathan Spencer Jones</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - With little more than two weeks to go before the start of the next Rothmans Cape to Rio race, preparations are gathering pace for this, one of the foremost southern hemisphere yachting events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet it has not proved as popular as had been expected with the final total of 59 entries for the Rio race falling far short of both the 120 that were expected, and the 82 yachts that set sail in the last event three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is likely to prove as exciting as ever with the current record for the crossing of 15 days three hours, set by Broomstick in the last race, under threat from several entrants. But time is running out for Broomstick owner Dr Michel Kast to complete the modifications that would ensure her competitiveness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two top favourites are undoubtedly Fancourt's Morning Glory, owned by German Dr Hasso Plattner, and Swede Ludde Ingvall's Nicorette. Plattner, who won the 1993 event on handicap on the 15,4m Morning Glory, has returned to defend the title with a larger 24,5m carbon fibre-constructed ILC70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nicorette, on the other hand, is both smaller -- 21,8m -- and older, begining her career in the 1989 Whitbread. But after substantial modifications has established an impressive record, including winning the 1995 Fastnet race with a full 24-hour lead over her nearest rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there will be strong competition from other entrants, including the new Simonis 60 Warrior owned by Phil Gutsche and to be skippered by Rick Nankin and another Simonis 60 Merlin, owned by Bill Jones, a near sister ship to Padda Kuttel's Namsa Challenger which came second on handicap in the 1993 race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of the attraction of the Cape to Rio has been that many entrants have participated for the sheer enjoyment of doing so, and still the majority of entries fall into this class: Sammy Naidu on his self-built Aquarius 1, a group of UCT students sailing H20 International, the &quot;all-girl&quot; crew headed by Marion Cole on Kelly Girl and Dudley Dix on Black Cat which he designed himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bertie Reed will be back sailing his L34 Three Ships Whisky with a modified keel to improve performance, as will veteran Voortrekker II under her new name Trekker 2, having been extnsively overhauled by new owner Alf Duncan. The South African Navy will be entering their Centurions Southern Floe and Southern Maid, as well as their latest acquisition the Fast 42 Umoya Omusha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rio race begins on January 6 with an optional start for the slower yachts in the cruiser class on January 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 22, 1995<BR>by Lungile Madywabe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - On the field, South African soccer has made admirable progress since its readmission into world football three years ago but this progress has not been reflected in the administration of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is therefore worrying when South African Football Association (Safa) executive president Solomon Morewa continues to lambast journalists for what he calls &quot;bad soccer coverage&quot;. What this means is that journalists must pretend not to see serious pitfalls in the administration of this popular sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To back up his argument he cites the recent results the national team and Orlando Pirates have achieved. This is, as he says, &quot;despite many years of isolation South African soccer has endured&quot;. But Morewa is missing the point. People are not undermining Safa soccer and its achievements, but are pointing fingers at the inept administration that the organisation and its affiliate the National Soccer League (NSL) are known for.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simple things like meting out punishment to teams transgressing the rules take many months before appropriate action is taken. It took the NSL disciplinary committee more than two months to settle a protest lodged by Mamelodi Sundowns against Rabali Blackpool for failing to produce one of their players' ID cards. There are many disciplinary cases that were supposed to be heard this year but for reasons best known to the NSL, they have been carried over to next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What about Safa's continued failure to deal with the question of unity between the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) and the NSL? One hopes that this embarrassing issue will be sorted out next year. One also hopes that the problem of security will be given sober attention now that Pirates has been fined R18 000, for the violence that occurred at the FNB stadium in their match against Asec Mimosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On a lighter note one hopes that the level of administrative competence and efficiency required by CAF for the smooth running of the African Nations Cup in January will not end with the tournament but will be carried through to our domestic game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tournament features 16 African countries, runs from January 13 to February 3. It will be played at four venues across the country: Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, Durban and Port Elizabeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African footballer of the year George Appong Weah will accompany the Liberia team in their quest to conquer Africa. Liberia are in group C which is based in Durban. They are in the same group as Nigeria, Zaire and Gabon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our own team will probably feature the likes of Leeds United striker Philemon Masinga and Mark Williams of Wolverhampton. Masinga has been out of action for the better part of the year because of a groin injury. Brendon Augustine, who last played for South Africa in the friendly international against Mozambique, is likely to be recalled to partner Masinga and Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andre Arendse of Cape Town Spurs is likely to keep his place in the goals. Arendse denied Jurgen Klinsmann a goal when he made a timely save in a goaless draw between South Africa and Germany recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana, who are in a group with Tunisia, Ivory Coast and Mozambique, will pin their hopes on twice footballer of the year Abedi &quot;Pele&quot; Ayew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holders Nigeria have been plagued by the political problems in their country which have affected the preparations of their national team. They were recently supposed to travel to theNetherlands but the trip was cancelled and the Israeli embassy refused to give them visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their striker Rashid Yekini, who is based in Spain, may not be fit to play in the tournament because of a nagging injury. The Nigerian squad is likely to include youngsters from their 1993 under-17 team and the under-20 squad who featured in the Africa Championship this year. In a last gasp attempt to tune up for the tournament, Nigeria are negotiating to travel to Tunisia or Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Expect to see a much changed Zambian team from the one that took part in the Four Nations tournament. Coach Roald Poulsen is unlikely to travel to South Africa without his two Saudi Arabia-based players, Harrison Chongo and Elijah Litana. Johnston Bwalya and Kalusha Bwalya, who is based in Switzerland, both missed the tournament and this time they are likely to be make the trip south.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 22, 1995<BR>by Shaun de Waal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa's book of the year has to be Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom. It came out late last year, and went on to scoop the 1995 Alan Paton Prize as well as the CNA Award. It sold staggering amounts in hardcover, and is now available in a satisfyingly hefty paperback from Abacus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela tells a riveting story, the ultimate &quot;struggle is my life&quot; tale, from his Transkei childhood, through his years as a lawyer, treason-trialist, and Black Pimpernel, taking in nearly three decades in prison, up to the political manoeuvrings that led, finally, to his release and the death of apartheid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's true that, as earlier reviewers pointed out, he doesn't reveal anything surprising behind the &quot;mask&quot; of beloved statesman in a funky shirt.  There are, however, charming sidelights such as his self-evaluation as a young man in the big city: &quot;I was hardly a Don Juan. Awkward and hesitant around girls, I did not know or understand the romantic games that others seemed to play effortlessly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It may be a little stodgy in places, but Long Walk to Freedom is one of the great epics of our time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How strange and enlightening, then, to revisit the last 30 years' history from an entirely different and quite oblique angle -- refracted through the poetry of Breyten Breytenbach. Die Hand Vol Vere (Human &amp; Rousseau) is his collected poems, edited by Ampie Coetzee. Something to pore over, it is an extraordinary panoply of images and metaphors, personal and political, condensed into an Afrikaans that in every burning phrase subverts, remakes and renews the erstwhile &quot;language of apartheid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As far as fiction is concerned, I've been recommending Jonathan Coe's novel What a Carve Up! (Penguin) to anyone who will listen. It is, as critic Terry Eagleton so aptly says, &quot;one of the few pieces of genuinely political post-modern fiction around&quot;. Focusing on a ruthless upper-crust family in the years of Conservative dominance in Britain, it is written with awesome bravura and has a plot of dizzying complexity -- but the kind of complexity that, like a good whodunnit, grips the reader mercilessly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frank Ronan's Dixie Chicken (Sceptre) is also a brilliantly plotted novel, a mystery about one man's life and death. It is narrated by God, who, apart from some unique personal preoccupations, sounds much like any other omniscient narrator. Dixie Chicken is funny, sad, and unputdownable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And then there's Poppy Z Brite, whom I've also recommended to many -- often to be told that she's just too much. She is, indeed, utterly over-the-top: she's a horror writer unafraid of gory excess, an observer of human relationships who revels in carnal sensation. Lost Souls is her vampire novel, and Drawing Blood, which is even better, is a sort of cyber-thriller with a bit of haunted-house spookiness thrown in. Her stories are collected in Swamp Foetus (all Penguin).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robertson Davies, Canada's greatest novelist, died at 82 this year. He'd just released The Cunning Man (Viking), which looked likely to be the second novel in what would have been his fourth trilogy. Sadly, we'll never get the final volume, but The Cunning Man is Davies at his best, and one can only be enriched by reading all his other books, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, posthumously, Anthony Burgess, who died in 1993, has given us Byrne (Hutchinson), a novel in verse. Awesome and rebarbative as only Burgess could be, it tells the tale of a monster-genius composer-artist and his offspring, raising many of the questions Burgess worried at for most of his career. Like the Davies book, it makes one want to read its author's previous masterpieces again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clive James' book of literary essays, The Metropolitan Critic (Picador), was first published in 1974. It has now been reissued with an &quot;auto-critique&quot; by the author (in other words, he tells you in endnotes what was wrong with each essay, or how bad he felt saying nasty things about so-and-so). It is a model of refreshingly lucid criticism, a salutary lesson in how to read -- and think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roland Barthes is another critic whose work inspires, though in a different way to James. James, in fact, would probably be ever so slightly suspicious of the slippery Frenchman, with his gnomic paradoxes and delicate fragments, such as those in Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes, the quasi-autobiography now reissued by Papermac. But I, for one, find him stimulating in a way few other critics are. If one is going to be puzzled, it's a pleasure to be puzzled by Barthes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It doesn't take soothsayer's skills to predict the contents of the government's White Paper on Arts and Culture, which will be released in the new year. Simply refer to the first draft proposal of the government-appointed Arts and Culture Task Group (Actag), released in May this year, and the second, published in August: apart from the blunting of some clauses and the sharpening of others, the spirit of the paper will remain the same -- a total transformation of the ways in which arts and culture will be structured and funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite its shortcomings, Actag will be remembered as the most representative policy- making body ever convened on the arts in this country.  As such, it has succeeded admirably in serving as a conduit for the White Paper in articulating an accessible cultural democracy, the likes of which South Africa has never seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Andries Oliphant, chairperson of the now- dissolved Actag, who is assisting the Ministry of Arts and Culture in co-ordinating and formulating its final policy: &quot;The Actag report serves as an essential basis for the White Paper, but it needs to be translated into a manageable, co-ordinated system of integrated implementation, within the context of the country's limited resources.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Founded in the principles of openness, accountability and transparency, the White Paper will confirm the abolition of the old government's performing arts councils (PACs) -- all of which benefited unfairly from the previous government's &quot;white might&quot; approach to culture, which saw a skewed centralisation of cultural resources within white sectors of society at the expense of the values, traditions and cultural expressions of the black majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while the White Paper will hopefully not attempt to impose arbitrary racial and cultural distinctions between Western and African art, it will propose the establishment of structures geared towards addressing the needs of neglected and marginalised sectors. Chief among these will be the establishment of a National Arts Council to determine and administer arts funding; the creation of a statutory national film body which will regulate the industry; the allocation over the next five years of at least 50 percent of arts funding to the development of culture in historically disadvantaged communities; and the introduction of compulsory arts education up to Standard Eight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chapter and verse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White Paper will deal with a policy and vision for South African culture, and the role of government in facilitating its development. It is divided into three chapters; the first section will deal with &quot;arts and culture&quot;: fine arts, crafts, theatre, dance and music; the second with heritage (museums, monuments, place names, heraldry); and the separate, third chapter with the specific needs of the capital-intensive film industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Building blocks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With input from hotly debated submissions from nine provincial task teams, the White Paper represents a composite of three funding models used by most of the Commonwealth countries which embarked on a radical transformation of their arts sponsorship policies after World War II:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l the patron model implemented in the United Kingdom, which adopts an essentially laissez- faire attitude towards the arts, with government supplying the funds without stringent structures of accountability;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l the facilitative approach taken by Canada, whereby a legal framework has been secured for the private sector to enter the realm of arts sponsorship through tax concessions, trusts and endorsements; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l the architectural model implemented in social democracies such as The Netherlands, which have established integrated networks of support, with governments funding up to 90 percent of the arts, without the latter being exposed to the vagaries of the market as is often the case with the facilitative model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Oliphant points out, South Africa is in the privileged position of being able to take the best of these three models, without having to resort to the engineer model (used in the former Soviet Union) whereby the state owns and controls all the means of artistic expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Of paramount importance is the principle of autonomy,&quot; he explains, &quot;but this also entails some form of responsibility on the part of government and the stakeholders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, while the White Paper will strongly advocate government involvement in funding, this will be implemented and administered at arm's length via the National Arts Council, whose members will be selected by a panel of independent judges chosen from public nominations. A shortlist will be prepared, public hearings arranged and the final selection rubber-stamped by the ministry. In other words, government will be required only to confirm the process without intervening directly in the appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nine provinces will be entitled to establish their own sub-committees and advisory boards to lobby for adequate slices of the funding pie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No honey, no money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cultural stakeholders will have to apply to the National Arts Council for financial support which will be awarded to them if they meet the following criteria: intrinsic artistic merit; financial and artistic need; cost-effectiveness; contribution to community artistic development, human resources development and training; educational value; and audience development. Each funding proposal will have to report on all of the above criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bones of contention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Key cultural figures are concerned that the White Paper's arts policy will be prescribed in accordance with the principles of heritage and reconciliation. This, they suggest, could lead to the arts council ruling through a system of &quot;censorship by consensus&quot;. They also stress that arts funding should be done completely independently of the government of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, they believe that the criteria for arts funding are too rigid. Certain cultural stakeholders, they argue, might need funding for projects of intrinsic artistic merit, but which might not make any palpable contribution to audience development or human resources training, for example. Conversely, a potentially beneficial educational project might have little artistic merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also argue that while the National Arts Council will be stringently structured at national level, at regional levels administration could become disconcertingly opaque, resulting in the possible exclusion of small community-based cultural groups from the national funding pie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are also fears that urban centres will continue to receive a larger share than their rural counterparts, as was the case with the 1994/95 budget which allocated a piffling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> R2-million to the Northern Province and R71-million to Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief director of the Ministry of Arts and Culture, Themba WaKashe, insists the council will be broadly representative, reflecting a diversity of viewpoints. &quot;We are also trying to avoid a situation where there will be a conflict of interest between council members whose personal agendas might take top priority over the interests of democracy,&quot; he says. &quot;But we will be dependent on the council make- up from public nominations. It is therefore not up to us to prescribe who should or should not be selected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dissolution of the PACs means that formerly protected cultural institutions such as the State Theatre in Pretoria will no longer receive block grants from government for core funding and projects. From now on they will have to join the queues waiting for cultural hand-outs from a cash-strapped government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, together with the proposed allocation of at least 50 percent of arts funding to the development of culture in historically disadvantaged communities, has generated an outcry from certain quarters -- among them the office of Deputy President FW de Klerk -- - who fear that the high arts, like ballet, opera and classical music, will suffer as a result. But, in the light of the disparities inherited from the previous government, relegation of the PACs to a lower rung on the priority ladder through fund-slashing is one way of redressing the imbalances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to proposing fund-raising through tax incentives, lotteries and levies, the White Paper will probably seek radically to revise South Africa's hopelessly outdated copyright legislation. But these moves could incur the wrath of the private-sector giants such as the publishing houses and record companies who are comfortable with existing laws affecting intellectual property; not to mention distributors who might be loathe to part with even a tiny percentage of their takings in order to finance the local film industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No money, no honey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White Paper on Arts will probably request at least one percent of the national Budget to be allocated to arts and culture, simultaneously suggesting that the government either increase its subsidy or provide incentives for private-sector sponsorship. But this is dependent on the Budget allocations, and to date the prognosis from government quarters is not encouraging. The previous government regarded the arts budget as an appendage of education. Currently it stands at a mere 0,01 percent of the entire Budget. Even if this amount were doubled, it would be miniscule in the grand scheme of things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Oliphant: &quot;We are not asking for a lot. At the same time we don't want to be paralysed through lack of funding. In the past, we've had to get by on minimal means and we are determined to refine, restructure and reconstitute local culture with or without the resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Any shortlist of jazz groups of the year must include the Mingus Big Band. All their material was written long ago by Charles Mingus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, does their album Gunslinging Birds (Dreyfus FDM) confirm the fears of those who grumble about jazz navel-gazing instead of thrusting ever onward?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If it does, that's their fault. One cannot equate band or album with, say, a Duke Ellington piece played by Wynton Marsalis. Mingus left few formal scores for a large orchestra. He did, though, leave enough to indicate how he would tackle the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost everything on Gunslinging Birds has been put together by members, drawn from the pool of top musicians who meet once a week in New York. The result sounds as you would expect a Mingus big band to sound, from the barnstorming Gunslinging Bird itself and Jump Monk to the reflective Reincarnation of a Lovebird.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mingus, one should never forget, wrote great galumphing melodies that beg to be orchestrated, just as the call-and-response patterns imposed by interlocking riffs, the essence of ensemble jazz as gloriously embodied by Hog Callin' Blues, abound in his recorded legacy. Every soloist stands out, notably Philip Harper on trumpet and pianist Kenny Drew Junior who earns extra marks for expertly propelling the music as part of the rhythm section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's spelled Big Bang on the spine. An inspired misprint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 22, 1995<BR>by Reg Rumney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Suddenly, at the end of a year in which economic growth and fiscal and monetary discipline held centre stage, joblessness has entered like Banquo's ghost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official unemployment rate is around 33 percent, but the Reserve Bank has estimated formal unemployment at more than 40 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why has the concern about unemployment re- emerged so suddenly? Probably because, after years of recession, South Africa had an economic recovery this year, but few jobs were created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Growth this year has been good, held back only by a poor performance from the gold mines as they struggled to come to terms with declining ore grades and labour problems, and by agriculture, hard-hit by drought.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Chamber of Business believes economic growth, as measured by the g<BR>ross domestic product -- the total value of all goods and services produced in the economy -- - will be at least three percent this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Budget presented in March by Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg was designed to emphasise to the world that the new government would not embark on irresponsible spending. It promised to reduce the amount the government has to borrow to balance its books, the so- called &quot;deficit before borrowing&quot; and to switch from spending on salaries and the like to investment; that is, to reduce &quot;dissaving&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign investment poured in: Old Mutual economist Terence Moll says capital inflows will total about 2,5 percent of gross domestic product this year. Most of this was speculative, going into bonds and shares, but Alan Hirsch of the Department of Trade and Industry has reckoned that by June this year R2,5-billion had flowed in through foreign direct investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business confidence remained fairly high, and economic growth led to a surge in imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals' monetary policy did seem to have achieved its results: inflation fell below seven percent, a level last seen some 23 years ago, although competition from food imports must take some credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Firms did well this year, in general. With agriculture and gold mining stripped out, the economy increased output by 4,3 percent during the first half of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So why were so few jobs created?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Was it that the Trade and Industry Ministry, under Trevor Manuel, embraced competition more vigorously than some South African businessmen liked? Were tariffs on imported goods, designed to protect South African industry, reduced too sharply?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Job losses are an inevitable consequence of the long-protected South African industry being exposed to outside competition. What then of the vaunted foreign direct investment of more than R2,5-billion this year?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hirsch notes that there is almost a total lack of foreign investment in outward-oriented manufacturing. He says most investment is aimed at getting a share of the domestic market. This introduces competition, but not the much-need filip to export earnings, and to job-creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Domestic and foreign businessmen, naturally enough, say they would like better incentives to locate their plants here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conservative answer to making that growth come about is socio-political stability, fiscal and monetary discipline, wide-ranging structural reforms through trade, competition and privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Flexible labour markets&quot; are also part of the prescription, and inevitably this is taken to mean lower wages as well as higher productivity.  The union movement, on the other hand, has argued that higher wages actually lead to increased productivity. Economists believe this is putting the cart before the horse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The less-conservative solution is speeded-up government spending, principally, through the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), on things like housing, stimulating the economy and creating jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pace of the RDP as whole has proved disappointing, for various reasons that do not all lie with Minister without Portfolio Jay Naidoo's office. For example, a hoped-for building boom did not come about this year because of the failure of the low-cost housing drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, a speeded-up RDP could raise investor fears over fiscal policy becoming more relaxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the conservative prescriptions, privatisation, is not a panacea but seems necessary in some form or other, if only to cut into the State's R30-billion-a-year interest bill on central government debt and to foster competition. Unfortunately, it will almost certainly lead to some job losses, at least in the short term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever the right prescription, in the coming year economists agree growth will be even better than it has been this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But little progress is likely in creating more employment. Moll predicts a four percent growth rate, the best in 15 years, and says it could be higher. But, he says, even though employment in the formal sector is likely to grow at over two percent next year, the labour force is growing faster than that, and unemployment is set to rise further.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 22, 1995<BR>by Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - This year has proved South African voters prefer the devils they know. Society may be in the throes of social change, but the electorate has hung on doggedly to the politicians it elected on April 27 1994. The local government elections -- contrary to speculation -- did not redraw the political map. Instead, the results consolidated the positions of all the major parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analyst Stephen Friedman of the Centre for Policy Studies says it is unusual for voting patterns to be so stable in new democracies. But he points out that the major South African parties have been around for a long time, and allegiance to them goes back decades, if not generations. The ANC has been a political force since 1912, the National Party since the 1920s and Inkatha has been active for at least 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it's not just the electorate which is responsible here -- the political parties themselves have remained strangely static under the new dispensation, despite internal strains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been no significant defections between parties, although there were some small shifts at a local level in October as political entrepreneurs sought the best party to get them into office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Parliament there has been no movement at all, thanks partly to the anti-defection clause in the interim constitution, which makes crossing the floor tantamount to walking the plank: they lose their parliamentary seat.  The anti-defection clause has prevented party political fragmentation, and undermined rebellion within the ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All three major parties in the Cabinet have, however, felt internal stresses and strains. The ANC has had to control its &quot;populists&quot;: Winnie Mandela was demoted and Bantu Holomisa has been scolded back into line. The party has also had to discipline feisty traditionalists: Congress of Traditional Leaders (Contralesa) head Phatekile Holomisa will have to answer to the ANC's disciplinary committee this month for associating with Inkatha-aligned traditional leaders and calling for a boycott of the November elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the controversial South African issues -- the death sentence, abortion, moving Parliament from Cape Town, Nedlac -- have sparked off internal party arguments, and the parliamentary whips have had to enforce discipline to contain dissent within the ANC caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party had a black spring, when the media reported friction between &quot;liberale&quot; and hard-liners. Two factions in the party were identified as one backing Western Cape Premier Hernus Kriel, and another behind the softer-spoken Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Personality clashes aside, the scuffle was about whether the National Party ought to bare its teeth more fiercely in opposition, or whether it should make consensus-seeking its main objective. This question has never been finally resolved, although NP spokesman Marthinus van Schalkwyk says the party is much wiser for having had the debate, ugly though it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party, despite new-found wisdom, has made some strategic blunders by not trying hard enough to change the colour of its top leadership. It let slip two opportunities to promote &quot;New Nats&quot;. When a Cabinet post came up, Chris Fismer was selected as Minister of General Affairs. When there was a chance to elect a new provincial leader for the Western Cape, the party opted for the tired, over- worked Dawie de Villiers instead of bringing in a coloured leader. Given this reluctance to welcome blacks and coloureds into top leadership, it is unlikely the party will be able to make significant inroads into black support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inkatha Freedom Party secretary-general Ziba Jiyane believes the IFP had &quot;an average year&quot;. He says that the party did well in setting up new branches in Kwazulu-Natal, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces, thereby extending grassroots support. However, the political year will not really be over until the Kwazulu-Natal local government elections in March next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jiyane is not sure his party will remain in the GNU until 1999, saying the possibility of withdrawal is &quot;made even more likely by the behaviour of the ANC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the partners of the GNU still sit together in Cabinet, uncomfortable though it may be at times, forming a political core at the centre of the transition. And it is left to the smaller parties in government to play the true opposition. They do not have enough in common to form a front against the three big players, but they are able to find common ground once in a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Pan Africanist Congress and the African Christian Democratic Party have a voice to complain with, but no strength to mobilise opposition, the Democratic Party and the Freedom Front are political forces, despite their small base in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their styles of opposition are very different. Where DP leader Tony Leon revels in being provocative and challenges the ANC at every turn, Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen relies on his friendship with President Nelson Mandela and courteous diplomacy to get his way. While Leon and his nine other parliamentarians tackle the government on every issue on matters of principle, Viljoen and his 13 parliamentarians select the issues that are important to their voters and concentrate their energies on getting what they want through negotiations, often behind the scenes. Both have had some success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By now most politicians are on holiday, trying to rest in anticipation of yet another fierce year of political fighting. Preparation for next year's battles are under way: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the budget, the Magnus Malan trial, the war in Kwazulu-Natal, the remaining local government elections, crime and the final Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Two KwaZulu-Natal massacres in a week -- adding to the highest weekly &quot;political&quot; death toll in the province in six months -- contrasts sharply with a strong national trend of decreased violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police said 10 armed men attacked a kraal at Mvutshini on KwaZulu-Natal's South Coast on Tuesday night, killing an 80-year-old woman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They moved to another kraal nearby and set a house alight, killing two women, a 17-year-old girl and four children aged two to 11. Last Friday a massacre at Paddock, 40km away, claimed the lives of 10 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Human Rights Committee (HRC) said the two massacres pushed the weekly provincial toll to 22, the highest it had recorded since May. The deaths bucked a general trend of steadily decreasing violence both in KwaZulu-Natal and nationally. HRC figures released this week put the national total of &quot;political deaths&quot; at 54 for November, the lowest this year and almost a third of the 150 recorded in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The November toll for KwaZulu-Natal, 34, was also the lowest in the year and less than a third of February's 116.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The HRC said the latest deaths were &quot;an indication of the high level of political tension in the province&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The planned boycott of Shell filling stations didn't have much effect, but activists are still hopeful of getting support for their campaign, writes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SHELL South Africa has emerged from this week's two-day boycott of its 850 filling stations as an untouchable company -- not the first time a call for action against Shell has failed to take root locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The boycott, called by the South African Nigerian Democracy Support Group, was intended to show displeasure with the company's refusal to push the Nigerian government to stop human rights violations against minority Ogoni activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But South African consumers largely ignored the call to boycott Shell filling stations on Tuesday and Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shell spokesman Pieter Cronje said though it was too early to say whether sales had been affected, he estimated it would be minimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only picket reported nationwide was at Shell's Ben Schoeman Highway Ultra City between Johannesburg and Pretoria where 11 activists were arrested on a law prohibiting people from walking on a freeway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The poor response to the boycott call makes a mockery of executed Nigerian activist Ken Saro-Wiwa's address to a military court shortly before he was sentenced to death, in which he promised retribution for Shell's alleged ravaging of his native Ogoniland and complicity with the Nigerian military dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I and my colleagues are not the only ones on trial,&quot; Saro-Wiwa told the court. &quot;Shell is here on trial and it is well that it is represented by counsel said to be holding a watching brief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Its day will surely come and the lessons learnt here may prove useful to it for there is no doubt in my mind that the ecological war that the company has waged in the Delta will be called into question sooner rather than later and the crimes of that war will be duly punished. The crime of the company's dirty wars against the Ogoni people will also be punished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the late 1980s, Shell also escaped &quot;punishment&quot; in South Africa when local activists failed to respond to calls from Dutch anti-apartheid groupings to target the company in an attempt to force it to disinvest from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time, consumer boycotts called locally during protest campaigns were mostly successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Shell's headquarters in Holland were picketed and its petrol stations there sabotaged by anti-apartheid activists, the company -- like in Nigeria today -- quietly pumped millions of rands into anti- apartheid work, funding human rights, education and community-building initiatives -- work which some branded &quot;window dressing&quot; and others applauded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African-based Nigerian democracy activist Emma Idighejo said he was not disappointed at the response to the boycott. &quot;Our attitude is that this struggle is going to take some time and we will be using several tactics and methods along the way, for which our South African brothers have pledged their support,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What is significant about this boycott is not how many people did not fill up with Shell, but that it was a consciousness-raising exercise, and in that regard I would say it was a success.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 22, 1995<BR>by Vuyo Mvoko</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - This week's two-hour work stoppages, pickets and blockades at parastatals marked for privatisation -- though weak in impact -- portend a difficult relationship ahead for labour and the ANC-led government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For organised labour the events &quot;marked the beginning of a process of mobilisation against privatisation&quot;, a policy the Congress of South African Trade Unions says will benefit only the elite and result in job losses, but the government insists will benefit the economy, black empowerment and the Reconstruction and Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labour was forced into a public display of humility at its joint press conference with government on Monday last week, nearly retracting the more robust parts of its criticism of the government's privatisation plans. But now government may be in for a surprise over its announcement that parts of Telkom, SAA, Autonet, Transkei Airways and Bop Air are to be privatised.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jeremy Cronin, deputy general secretary of the South African Communist Party and member of the African National Congress National Executive Committee, insists labour &quot;succeeded in slowing down the speed&quot; of privatisation. Indeed, it looks like the South African labour movement is no longer willing to be a conveyor belt for what it sees as top-down government decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ambiguous nature of Cosatu's relationship with its alliance partner in government is demonstrated in the about-face of a tango they danced in the short space of a week: last week the allies tried to play down their tiff; two days later Cosatu general secretary Sam Shilowa supported a flash strike by transport workers; a day later this week's protests and a day-long national strike for January were being planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the meeting with Cabinet ministers, labour emerged embarrassed and contained. Shilowa paradoxically told journalists that the three-hour meeting had been part of a pre- scheduled ongoing consultation process between the two parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When challenged by a reporter whether, had that been the case, all the furore could not have been avoided had government held back on the announcement of its privatisation plans until after this meeting, neither Shilowa nor Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau wanted to reply. Then Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Pallo Jordan said the media &quot;blew it (the disagreement) out of proportion&quot; and got &quot;carried away with itself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps the media was the culprit -- if only it was not Cosatu which had expressed &quot;shock and disbelief&quot; at the government's announcement; if only Nactu had not said it would not sell its members out; and if the Federation of South African Labour Unions (Fedsal) had not spoken of a &quot;ridiculous announcement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If, as Cronin tried to explain this week, &quot;labour (simply) became suspicious of the strategic approach of the government&quot; -- or that government &quot;first had to make public their position for purposes of transparency&quot; before entering into negotiations with labour -- then perhaps we deserve explanations for government's monastic silence in the face of growing labour militancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two days after the public kiss-and-reconcile session, Shilowa showed rage when he addressed an anti-privatisation rally organised by the South African Railway and Harbour Workers Union. A day later this week's action and the January 16 24-hour strike was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Cosatu and the ANC, allies in labour and government, may have been born of the same liberation struggle, their interests are no longer synonymous. While it may be true, as Cronin argues, that the &quot;priority mandate&quot; of the ANC lies with the workers and the unemployed who voted for it, it is also true that very often governments attach greater weight to business interests. There is room for the &quot;betrayal&quot; of the workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu, on the other hand, may feel a lingering responsibility towards the RDP, its brain-child. Yet, just because the government is naming the RDP as one of the beneficiaries of privatisation, there is no reason for Cosatu to be cowed by this at the expense of disservice to its own membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cronin, whose SACP seems to be carefully walking the tightrope, insists &quot;there is no inevitability of a massive breakaway&quot; in the tripartite alliance. Maybe so, but as Cronin himself admits: &quot;The alliance is not a love affair.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>December 22, 1995<BR>by Anton Harber</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Six hundred days is not an awfully long time. A baby of that age -- 20 months -- might just be starting to use simple words, and would only recently have started to walk. It would still be teething.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next week will see the 600th day since the new government was inaugurated -- but it has moved beyond the stage of a baby taking its first strides. Twenty months is just about enough time to start seeing how the infant new South Africa is taking shape.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dominant images of 1995 are, for once, not images of terrible violence and bloodshed. These were present, notably in incidents of crime.  But mostly this was a year in which individuals, groups and organisations grappled with change -- the difficulties, the complexities, the frustrations, the traumas and the joy when it proved successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was too soon to count many successes. It was a time in which South Africans were forced to face up to the harsh realities of change: that one million houses cannot be built in a year; that the process is difficult, often frustrating and only occasionally fruitful; that we lack skills and experience; that the magnitude of the problems we inherited surpasses our worst imaginings; that new South Africans can be as incompetent and as corrupt, or just as mediocre, as old South Africans ... These were reasons -- or excuses -- used and used up this year, with varying degrees of validity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africans also revelled in the changes. Every aspect of our society was being recast -- labour policy, penal policy, health policy, transport policy, broadcasting ... There was no area left untouched by the project set out in our interim Constitution: to create a more open, more human and largely social democratic society. Undoubtedly, some great leaps forward were taken, such as in labour policy, land policy and justice. There were also some marked hiatuses: education being one example. Most significant this year, though, was not the successes and failures (see accompanying scorecards), but the fact that every individual and every institution had to grapple with change and confront their most deeply-rooted beliefs and habits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1995 was the year in which we had to confront what we could and could not achieve, but most of all it was the year in which we all wrestled with the change going on around us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These five vignettes are chosen to capture elements of that change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Television watchers this week saw a squatter in Moffat Park, south Johannesburg, on his knees, his arms spread out, pleading with those who had arrived to destroy his home. &quot;We merely ask for alternative land. They should not treat us as animals,&quot; one squatter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Various defences have been raised by those responsible for this action against squatters. It was done legally, in terms of a supreme court order (just what the previous government would have said). You have to protect property rights, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None of this negates the effect of seeing people's homes -- however ramshackle -- being destroyed by a state that has promisd, and not yet delivered, thousands of new houses, nor opened up land for these people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the old regime, Judge Richard Goldstone handed down a landmark decision which prevented evictions under the Group Areas Act unless the authorities provided alternative accommodation. It was a decision which effectively killed this horrendous Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year there has been no such caution. In the tough battle between homelessness and the prevention of land invasions, it was the homeless and powerless who were losing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The tall, graceful President Nelson Mandela standing with the diminutive Percy Yutar, the two having shared lunch, made a striking sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his inauguration speech, 600 days ago, Mandela laid out two priorities for his new government: reconciliation and the improvement of living conditions for the needy -- in that order. It was the rare wisdom of Mandela which put reconciliation at the top of the list, contrary to populist expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela has been extraordinarily successful at the first task -- though at substantial cost. His coup de grace was to visit Hendrik Verwoerd's widow, Betsie, for tea in the miserable &quot;homeland&quot; of Orania. Far-right-wing leaders, having to be polite, respectful and pay obeisance to the new president, were reduced to a meek bunch of eccentric citizenry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vision of Mandela shaking hands with quaint little Betsie was no longer horrifying, though it was still surprising. But it was not an empty gesture -- it was a political triumph for the president signalling a clear victory over the right-wing fanatics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not so when the president decided to invite for lunch his former prosecutor, Percy Yutar, a man more hated than most during the Rivonia trial for his determination to see Mandela receive the maximum penalty. Unlike the Verwoerd encounter, this meeting served no political purpose, except to rehabilitate an individual and boost his dubious claim that he was responsible for Mandela not getting the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a sign that reconciliation can go a step too far. It was also a reminder that it was wise to put reconciliation ahead of social reform in April 1994, and perhaps in April 1995. By April 1996, the priorities will probably be reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. William Makgoba arrived at his first University of the Witwatersrand council meeting wearing an Arab keffiyeh. Apparently, vice-chancellor Bob Charlton was so startled he forgot to introduce his new deputy. The flamboyant professor and the university hierarchy were off to a rough start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No event this year captures the difficulties of transformation as clearly as the battle of Wits. No incident has so clearly brought out tensions simmering below the surface of this changing country, pitting Africanists against liberals and calling into question issues of standards, the independence of institutions such as this, and the role of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Race is the unspoken issue in many such events. Wits brought it out into the open in a conflict which focused attention on all the toughest issues of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wits has always been a barometer of South African conflict, giving early signs of the direction our society is taking. It still is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Gauteng premier Tokyo Sexwale emerged from the home of the widow and orphan of a victim of a terrible hijacking and said it might be an idea to consider a referendum on the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This prospect was quickly dismissed by the government, but it did bring to the fore the battle between the populism of a charismatic politician, and the sense of justice the African National Congress brought with it to the government. It is a central dilemma of democracy: if the people want to string up criminals, will a government facing an election hold out against it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sexwale was looking for a quick-fix response to hide the reality: that there is no easy solution to crime in a country with high unemployment and a poor police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. &quot;Keep the last carriage on the gravy train for us&quot;, read one poster during the September nurses' strike in Gauteng. The focus of attention was on nurses toyi-toying over the grave of Florence Nightingale and the patients who were suffering as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a truly new South African conflict. Nurses, for long underpaid, had not seen their expectations met -- or even adequately listened to -- under the new government. They had received increases, weighted (in a proper new South African fashion) towards the least well-off -- but they also saw their colleagues across the corridor earning more than they. This was the result of inherited inequalities from the multiple structures of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government told them they had to return to work. The authorities had added up the figures, and it was clear they could not afford to give the nurses what they wanted. For example, just to give the 94 percent of nurses who are women the same housing rights as men would cost R1-billion. The government had spent R400-million on this, and had no more to give.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government insisted the nurses use the proper channels to air their grievances. The nurses said these were old South African structures and were flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If this one can't be solved, said health director general Olive Shisana, then we are all in trouble: &quot;It's the problem of the whole country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How well did the Cabinet do this year?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cabinet members are assessed only on their performance in government -- not on their party leadership or conduct outside Parliament (ie barging into live TV studios is not taken into account). They are rated on a scale of one to 10. Ten means they should have the job for life; one means they should be fired at dawn; five means they haven't achieved too much, but also haven't done much damage. (The figure in brackets is the rating we gave Cabinet members in April, when -- with few exceptions -- they had been in office for a year.) Compiled by Anton Harber</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nelson Mandela, president -- 9,5 (Previous scorecard, April 1995: 9,5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The growing tendency to treat the president as a living saint doesn't do him or his government any good. So we searched long and hard for signs that he was not perfect. We found one: his reluctance to undertake a minor but necessary Cabinet reshuffle, even though he himself was embarrased by the Foreign Affairs Ministry over Nigeria, and some of the ministries most important to his government programme are moving too slowly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thabo Mbeki, first deputy president -- 4 (6)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The de facto prime minister is pulled in too many directions to focus on any one thing for long enough. And when he does, he hasn't always got it right. He misread Nigeria -- perhaps the most serious error of the new government -- and earlier in the year he bungled, both the Allan Boesak and Winnie Mandela affairs. He remains a wily politician, systematically arming himself with the two essential weapons of modern politics: a support base among particular groups (such as women, who've been promised all future Cabinet appointments) and plenty of air miles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FW de Klerk, deputy president -- 4 (4)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk is one of the very few people for whom Mandela shows dislike, even contempt. But that's the least of the former president's problems. His biggest is the truth commission, largely because truth has never been a strong point of the National Party. After that comes the fact that his usefulness in the Government of National Unity has a time limit on it, and thereafter he will be leader of a party doomed to opposition and internal division. All of which makes him an unusual phenomenon: a man whose past is as uncertain as his future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kader Asmal. minister of water affairs and forestry -- 8,5 (8,5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who would have thought that water affairs could be so interesting, Archbishop Desmond Tutu recently asked. It took this diminutive and energetic intellectual to make it so. He can show solid progress towards bringing the number of people without running water down from 11-million and has won kudos for a campaign to get rid of aliens (trees, that is) in a way which also creates opportunities for the unemployed. Not content with that, the hyperactive professor chaired a special committee on arms sales policy, earned the sobriquet &quot;Dr Clean&quot; for his work on parliamentary ethics, and played a central role on almost every other tough Cabinet issue. A bottle of the minister's favourite brand of Irish whiskey goes to anyone who can find an issue on which he does not have an opinion, forcibly expressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sibusiso Bengu, minister of education -- 3 (4)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been some movement in education, but not nearly enough and not nearly fast enough. Bengu has announced a state loan scheme for tertiary education; the Hunter report into the organisation, governance and funding of schools is complete; and the National Qualifications Framework is in place.  But his National Education Policy Bill is running into political trouble and parents and teachers are as confused as ever about his policies. He has also threatened intervention at Wits University. Isn't it time for the good minister to take a long sabbatical?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pik Botha, minister of Mineral and energy affairs -- 5 (3)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having realised that bluster and bombast are not enough to get by in the new South Africa, Botha has learnt his new porfolio and now appears to be on top of the issues. That is, he has learnt that minerals are not just about the kind of water you mix with your brandy, and energy can be put to constructive use. He gets a neutral five because he has stopped doing much harm, and there's even a chance he might do some good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Minister of home affairs -- 5 (5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That Buthelezi is still in the Cabinet is achievement enough. His department appears to run with reasonable efficiency in his absence, since he is -- in spirit at least -- spending most of his time in Ulundi. In his favour is the way he has pursued a new Publications Control Bill; his draft may be flawed, but he has seen it through an extensive consultative process.  In the negative, he has not given much clear leadership on how to deal with illegal immigrants. He has made it hard for highly skilled northern hemisphere types to get in, but had little effect on those ducking under the border fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dawie de Villiers, minister of environment and tourism -- 5,5 (5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Villiers got off to a bad start when, in the manner he learnt in the rugby teams and mediocre cabinets of the past, he developed a reputation for non-consultation. He was never as good at tackling the issues as he was at tackling fly-halfs. But recently he has corrected course, having agreed to a full commission of inquiry into toxic waste policy and launched a full consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Fismer, minister of general services -- 6 (just appointed at time of last survey)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By all accounts, this minister has won the respect of his peers and his rivals. As his title suggests, nobody is sure what his job is, but whatever it is, he's doing it reasonably well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Derek Hanekom, minister of land affairs -- 8 (9)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nobody has steered through more important legislation than Hanekom, with his series of Bills on land reform and land tenancy and the creation of the land court. Implementation, on the other hand, may prove harder. Hanekom is the best travelled minister, at least within the country, having criss-crossed South Africa in his ministerial 4X4 to interact directly with people on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pallo Jordan, Minister of posts and telecommunications -- 5 (5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The inscrutable Jordan has continued to avoid the public eye, though he plays a strong behind-the-scenes role in the Cabinet. He is our virtual minister, having launched his Green Paper in cyberspace and because much of his portfolio is out of his hands -- he quite rightly has an arms-length attitude to the Post Office, Telkom, the SABC and the Independent Broadcasting Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Liebenberg, minister of finance -- 7 (7)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If his role was to be the banker, he has done it well, laying a solid fiscal foundation on which others can build the Reconstruction and Development Programme. He has formed a strong, if unlikely, threesome with deputy minister Alec Erwin and parliamentary committee chair Gil Marcus and maintained his credibility with the international and business communities.  He lacks the flourish of his predecessor Derek Keys -- but then he is a banker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mac Maharaj, minister of transport -- 5 (5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly after his appointment, Little Mac scored a public relations coup when it emerged that he was using public transport in disguise in order to get to know the field. Now his military experience will tell him that this is an unwise approach because of the danger of being caught in a minor war. He has tackled this taxi violence problem with a long-term view, based on careful, military-style strategy rather than any search for a quick fix.  Meanwhile, passengers are getting shot up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trevor Manuel, minister of trade and industry -- 8 (7)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This energetic minister has given strong leadership on industrial and trade policies, surrounded himself with a strong team and made a powerful impact. Fortunately, he is not being judged as leader of the National Assembly, a job for which he would have been the only minister to get below-zero marks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tito Mboweni, minister of labour -- 9 (9)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The youthful Mboweni steered through Parliament the most important single bit of legislation -- the complex new Labour Relations Act -- against all the odds. His Act may be flawed (only time will really tell), but he won the support of all the role players for his strongly social democratic vision. He also has surrounded himself with strong individuals and has scored points for accessibility and openness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roelf Meyer, minister of constitutional development, provincial affairs and local government -- 7 (6)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meyer's stock has gone up since the largely successful local government elections. He may be unpopular with his own party, but he can't be faulted for getting on with the job in his own quiet and determined way. His traditional leaders remuneration Bill did run into trouble, but that was the result of party politics rather than anything he did. To get things through Cabinet, he depends a lot on his deputy, Valli Moosa, but enjoys a good relationship with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joe Modise, minister of defence -- 2 (3)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is one post in which we should welcome a weak minister unable to come up with a credible threat analysis which would justify the size and power of our military. This way the Cabinet can continue to shift resources to departments with a purpose in the new South Africa, like education, health or water affairs. Don't move, Joe -- the RDP depends on it!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sankie Mthembi-Nkondo, minister of housing -- 4 (5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is one ministry in which progress can be measured with deadly accuracy. Only 11 000 houses of the five million promised by 1999 have been built. She can't expect a high rating until more go up. Admittedly, this minister had to step into another's shoes, change some of his policies and deal with often-recalcitrant financial institutions. But, hey, who said the job was going to be easy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sydney Mufamadi, minister of safety and security --- 5 (6)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our notes on Mufamadi's performance were stolen. The matter is being investigated. Need one say more?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sipo Mzimela, Minister of correctional services -- 5 (4)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mzimela appears to have sprung to life in recent months, making a stronger impact. However, his department still appears to have trouble keeping serious criminals behind bars. Those without the wit to organise parole are able to escape with alarming ease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jay Naidoo, minister without portfolio -- 5 (4)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ag shame! Naidoo takes all the blame for slow delivery, and line ministers take all the credit for speedy delivery. There are signs that the RDP will kick in next year in a significant way, so as long as he isn't promising zero-based budgeting and a million houses a year, he will be able to show progress. Until then, he gets a neutral rating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ben Ngubane, minister of arts, culture, science and technology -- 7 (6)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scientists are happy, having won a pile of RDP money to promote their cause. Artists are always more difficult, but his advisory group Actag has reported and reform has begun in the old performing arts councils. If nothing else, he is keeping artists off the streets by giving them jobs in places like the arts councils. Ngubane has won respect for his skill and his gentlemanly conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alfred Nzo, minister of foreign affairs -- 1 (2)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If there is a glaring lacuna in our new government, it is the lack of a coherent, effective foreign policy to take advantage of our potential continental, and even world, leadership and exploit all the goodwill out there. Isn't there a quiet diplomatic posting for the good minister who has given many years of faithful service to the African National Congress, preferably in a peaceful country which does not do much trade?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dullah Omar, minister of justice -- 9 (9)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This ministry faces a myriad of tough issues, and Omar has confronted them all head on. His truth commission may be flawed, but it is up and running, and he has tackled juvenile punishment, bail conditions, crime, affirmative action on the bench, the split bar, and a range of other human rights and justice issues with an unparalleled drive and determination. To give him a high rating is only, ahem, just.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jeff Radebe, minister of public works -- 5 (6)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shouldn't this department play a more central role in the RDP? Since noisily firing his director-general, Radebe has gone quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stella Sigcau, minister of public enterprises -- 5 (4)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This minister has moved on privatisation, which is her major task, though she could have moved more swiftly and been firmer in articulating the arguments in favour of it and ensuring it all went through the proper processes to limit opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zola Skweyiya, minister of public service and administration -- 4 (5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Skweyiya had to wait months for the Public Service Commission to approve appointments to his own department, proving to anyone who may still doubt it that he has not yet asserted authority over the institution which is the biggest single obstacle to change. Ask any new civil servant or minister whom they hate most in the world, and they will name this commission, which has held up every appointment, every restructuring, every new post, without having stemmed the growth of the public service. Radical surgery is needed -- such as getting rid of the commission altogether -- and Skweyiya will get higher points when he wields the scalpel. But first, he will have to get the commission's permission to buy one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steve Tshwete, minister of sport -- 6 (5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps all sport needs is an avuncular figure to turn up frequently at the stadiums and to mediate conflicts when they occur. If that is the case, Uncle Steve has done it well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kraai van Niekerk, minister of agriculture -- 5 (4)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, you can't blame him for the drought, can you? Or for the floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abe Williams, mMinister of welfare -- 2 (2)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the minister who went to a conference on wife battery, and said he appreciated the chance to look at some beautiful women! Can't someone send him to sensitivity classes? He has, however, shown a keen interest in welfare -- his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkosazana Zuma, minister of health -- 8 (8)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nobody can fault this minister for speed. Despite the enormous task she faced, she has appointed strong people around her and moved swiftly on a range of issues. She tackled the tobacco lobby -- and won; she has been strong on Aids policy and the prioritisation of primary health care. Her health finance plan remains controversial, but at least she has one. However, the central problem, and the one consuming most of her budget, is hospital administration, and this remains in crisis. But be warned: getting in the way of this minister could be bad for your health.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - A suspected case of Ebola virus was reported to WHO on 6 December. The patient was a 25- year-old male from a village in neighbouring Liberia who was admitted to hospital in the Tabou Prefecture (south of Tai National<BR>Park).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The man appears to be recovering from the illness. The diagnosis of Ebola virus infection was confirmed by serological tests carried out at the Institute Pasteur in Paris. A WHO team including an expert from the Institut Pasteur has investigated the case in close cooperation with the Ministry of Health, Midecins sans Frontihrs, Epicentre (Paris) and UNHCR.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team has ensured the patient is properly isolated in the hospital and that all precautions have been taken to prevent spread of the infection.  The team has also investigated hospital and village contacts of the confirmed case and visited the household of the case which is located in Plibo Village Maryland County, Liberia. The man lived there with three other men and two women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team found two of the three men were sick with fever and extreme fatigue which could be signs of Ebola virus infection.Both have been isolated in their home. The third man is well. Of the two women one has been hospitalized in Ctte d'Ivoire with symptoms which could be Ebola fever. The other one is well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Samples of blood from the three suspect cases are under investigation.  WHO is presently organizing an international study of the epidemiology and ecology of the virus in the Tai Forest Region of Ctte d'Ivoire. The reservoir and vector of Ebola virus in nature remains unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHO does not recommend that any special measures be instituted for international travel (in relation to the Ebola incident) to and from Ctte d'Ivoire and Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Post of Zambia<BR>December 28, 1995<BR>by Goodson Machona</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) says the<BR>letter written to President Frederick Chiluba by Post managing director<BR>and editor-in-chief Fred M'membe was in bad taste and has advised him to restrain himself when dealing with the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a press statement released in Lusaka yesterday, FODEP secretary, Bishop<BR>John Mambo, said although M'membe could have been hurt by the President's<BR>comments on his profession as a journalist, he should have checked his emotions and language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Criticisms on the presidency and even the President is a necessary role for the press as a watchdog of democracy but what appears to be emerging at<BR>the moment is an apparent element of personal vendetta between Mr. Chiluba and<BR>some people in Post management,&quot; Mambo said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the stand by FODEP has been condemned by most political and civic<BR>leaders who feel M'membe has the right to defend his integrity against such<BR>attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As ZDC , we are greatly disturbed and displeased at the partisan position<BR>FODEP has adopted at the independent media's coverage of Mr. Chiluba's life<BR>and political activities,&quot; said Zambia Democratic Congress deputy (ZDC) general secretary Azwell Banda. He charged that it was &quot;strange and grossly<BR>unfair that FODEP would wish to protect a head of state who has such immense<BR>power instead of an ordinary citizen, &quot;Banda said in an interview<BR>yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Zambia Civic Education Association chairperson and human rights lawyer<BR>Lucy Sichone said President Chiluba opened himself up to ridicule because he<BR>attacked M'membe in public. &quot;A wise saying by Solomon says a king never insults a servant in public because the servant will insult back the King<BR>and when the servant insults back, he brings the entire kingship into<BR>disrepute,&quot; Sichone said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said President Chiluba has brought the Presidency into disrepute by<BR>spending time and money insulting one individual. &quot;I have travelled and read<BR>widely. Never have I seen a President who spends his time insulting an editor of a paper wherever he goes. So by attacking M'membe in public it is the President who is embarrassing himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The presidency has its own dignity, its own integrity and the person holding that office currently has brought it in disrepute,&quot; Sichone said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberal Progressive Front president Rodger Chongwe also condemned what he<BR>described as FODEP's blatant display of bias. &quot;I don't agree with the sentiments expressed by FODEP an organisation which I feel should exhibit<BR>impartiality and independence instead of catowing to the authorities by saying when you are insulted by the President you must shut up because he is the boss<BR>of the country,&quot; Chongwe said in an interview yesterday. &quot;M'membe has every right to defend his integrity and his right of expression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And National Party secretary general, Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika said<BR>FODEP has been inobjective. &quot;Mr Chiluba has been using every political fora,<BR>radio and television, used public funds to run adverts to personally attack one citizen. FODEP has never come to the rescue of M'membe nor advised Chiluba<BR>to refrain,&quot;Akashambatwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Akashambatwa further advised that &quot;non-governmental organisations should<BR>not allow themselves to be used to intervene in public discussions on a one sided basis. &quot;I expect organisations like FODEP to always be balanced in their<BR>judgement and take account of both sides of issues and be principled,&quot; Akashambatwa said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - In yesterday's edition we carried a part transcript of<BR>President Chiluba's attacks on The Post newspaper in General and its Managing<BR>Director and Editor-in-Chief Fred M'membe in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President made the attacks during a ZNBC Radio 2 Night Line<BR>programme with Ben Kangwa aired on Sunday December 24. M'membe has replied to<BR>the president in a letter he wrote him on Monday December 25 which we reproduce in full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dear Mr Chiluba,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am writing to respond to your attacks on me on ZNBC radio<BR>Night Line programme last night. I know you are desperately trying to entangle<BR>yourself from the stories about your place of birth, parentage and the source of your form two certificate that appeared in The Post over the last month, but please do it without telling lies about me.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a man who last night criticised me and The Post for not verifying issues<BR>before we publish, I believe you knew the truth behind all the false things you said about me on Night Line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance you claimed that I just did my journalism by correspondence on<BR>last year and this year I am editor-in-chief. I challenge you to produce my<BR>correspondence certificate or name of the institution with which I have been<BR>studying journalism. The truth is you are a liar. You were lying about my<BR>correspondence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And since you deliberately chose to slander me I am asking you to waive your presidential immunity so that I can commence litigation's against you for your malicious lies against, whose sole purpose is to undermine my credibility as a journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have not gone around, like you, boasting about my academic and professional attainments. But the records are there at St.John's Secondary<BR>School, in Mongu, where I did my junior secondary school; St. Francis Secondary School, in Malole, Kasama, where I did my senior secondary school; and the University of Zambia where I obtained my first degree in 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And if the archives have been tempered with my classmates at all<BR>stages, including grade one, my education are still there to testify. My<BR>teachers and lecturers are also traceable. We can compare our certificates at<BR>every stage of our education and see who is a better scholar, since you see<BR>yourself as a &quot;great scholar&quot;. This may be unnecessary, but it shows how much you have lowered the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I don't think you have much to show in terms of academic and<BR>professional attainments. And it was not because of your the few '0' levels and an 'A' level that the people of Zambia voted you president. It was for the commitment you exhibited, through trade unionism, to their causes that won you<BR>their hearts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About the practice of journalism you know very little, if not nothing, and I won't waste my time arguing with you over it - as USA Senator William<BR>Gibbs McAdoo once remarked: &quot;It is impossible to defeat an ignorant man in an<BR>argument.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You also accused me of trying to be seen to be brave. Brave, I may be, but just I as do not read books to exhibit to others about how much of Plato, John Locke, or Adam Smith I know, there is very little that I do for 'show off'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But I am proud that I have Chinsali genes in me. I can challenge you to study the history of my father's family in Chinsali and discover for yourself what type of blood propels me. If you need help Chief Nkula is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And to this add my mother's Nyengo genes and blood. Those who have<BR>campaigned in Kalabo know what I am talking about. After all, it seems it is you, and not me, who is more worried about what you are seen to be and not what you are. This complex can easily be seen in ones dressing, accents, and<BR>desperation to acquire and exhibit that which you lacked - suits, degrees, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You also accused me of insulting people. You have on many occasions<BR>unleashed your policemen on me, even over matters, which you very well knew<BR>the paper had published &quot;nothing but the truth&quot;, to arrest me for criminal libel. If I have insulted anyone, including yourself, let them take me to<BR>court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The truth is, however, you seem not to distinguish between unpleasant news<BR>and insults. But if you insult me I will insult you back. I am your subject. You and me are equal citizens of this country. And not even Chief Nkula, to<BR>whom I am a subject can insult me, without risking to be dethroned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You are neither a father of this nation nor a chief of Zambia, but a servant of the people of this country, including those you hate. To think that<BR>you are, as president, metaphorically equivalent to fatherhood in a family, and that citizens are equivalent to your children, is a dangerous form of paternalism fundamentally in conflict with the possibility of democracy in a modern political system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The threats you had been issuing against me and my colleagues are<BR>unnecessary. You know very well that you can't intimidate me. You have done<BR>bad things to me. You ordered your policemen to arrest and lock me up in a filthy cell over the story of your affair with Clementine Kabondo on a matter that you knew I deserved police bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I advise you to stop these threats. These demean the office of president. Just be brave enough and do what you want to do, I am ready for anything. But please stop telling lies about me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you really feel that the stories about the claims of Luka Chabala Kafupi of being your biological father, your being born in Zaire, and allegations of you forging a form two certificate are not true let's have a DNA test and appoint an international commission, through the Commonwealth Secretariat, to<BR>establish the truth and end the controversy. I will not take your word for it<BR>- falsifiers of history do not safeguard liberties but imperil them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of taking up valuable air time on Christmas eve to give hope to the<BR>people of Zambia you selfishly used it to lie about me. I hope you had time to<BR>listen to USA President Bill Clinton's Christmas message and compared it with<BR>yours - a born again Christian president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And since you have taken me to court on allegations that I have defamed you, in the interests of justice and equity, I ask you to waive your presidential immunity so that I can get you prosecuted for your malicious lies against me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I await your reply on waiving your immunity,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yours sincerely, Fred M'membe</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Former President Kenneth Kaunda says he is puzzled at<BR>the number of lies that has rocked the MMD leadership. Kaunda said this in a telephone interview yesterday from his Shambalakale farm in Chinsali in reaction to President Chiluba's claim on Sunday's ZNBC Radio NightLine programme that government had never said they intended to deport the<BR>former president to Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Kaunda was playing to the gallery. Nobody ever said he was going to be<BR>deported. I never made that statement,&quot; Chiluba said, adding: &quot;I think it was some kind of mistake on the doubts about him that (home affairs) minister Sampa made that statement which sent panic, as they say, the guilty are always<BR>afraid.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when asked to explain his &quot;mistake&quot; in a telephone interview yesterday,<BR>Sampa said he could only respond to written press query.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Kaunda insists President Chiluba was lying, there was a plan to<BR>deport him.&quot;I can't understand why these people should lie over a matter that is known by everybody,&quot; Kaunda said. &quot; Everybody knows that government<BR>intended to deport me, they are just reacting to pressure from Zambian and<BR>international political and religious organisations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda insisted that on October 8, 1995 he was summoned from Shambalakale Farm by police at force headquarters in Lusaka to answer questions related to his citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was summoned by police over the same issue but everything was discontinued after police realised that they were causing great tension in people as there were reports in the papers and rumours in Lusaka that I had been called by police over my deportation. A Musonda from Force headquarters<BR>went to see my lawyer and told him that I was not going to appear before the<BR>police because of the alarm the case was causing in Lusaka,&quot; Kaunda explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've also been having difficulties in persuading my wife from suing home affairs minister Chitalu Sampa for the allegations he made that my wife was<BR>also a foreigner. I just can't understand what these people are up to,&quot; Kaunda carped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former president also termed Chiluba's statement on The Post as<BR>baseless and intimidatory. &quot;I condemn this with my strongest words. The Post<BR>was there when we were in government and they condemned us together with<BR>Chiluba and his people,&quot; Kaunda said, asking: &quot;Why should Chiluba turn now and condemn The Post?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda added: &quot;Anyway I am not surprised, these are the democrats of today<BR>but I am sure The Post people will not allow themselves to be intimidated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda was on October 8, this year summoned by Lusaka Central police in<BR>what UNIP and the opposition believed to be the first step towards deporting him from Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Post of Zambia<BR>December 27, 1995<BR>by Mukalya Nampito</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Political parties last Friday failed to show up at a<BR>meeting called by the Elections Office to discuss the &quot;best ways to conduct the voters' registration&quot;, director of elections Rabson Mwansa complained in an interview last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some political parties are saying Mwansa is not serious<BR>about their participation in whole exercise.  &quot; We last week on Thursday issued out a general invitation to all political parties and civic organisations to discuss the matter at a meeting last Friday but none turned up,&quot; Mwansa carped. &quot;The Elections Office is ready to discuss the best ways to conduct the voters' registration.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) has complained about the manner in<BR>which Mwansa had extended his invitation to political parties. &quot;They should have invited us either by phone or letters not a general invitation in<BR>the press,&quot; said ZDC deputy secretary general Azwell Banda in an interview<BR>yesterday, adding: &quot;This is one of petty practices meant to make political parties look ridiculous and irresponsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And National Party secretary for elections, Kabwe Kalimalwendo, his party<BR>was not aware of the Friday meeting. &quot;We did not receive any invitation, if we had we would have gone there,&quot; Kalimalwendo said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Mwansa has promised to issue direct invitations to the political<BR>parties and civic organisations. But Banda complained that the Elections Office has never treated the registration of voters as an important nonpartisan national issue. &quot;We wrote a letter to the Electoral Commission on October 24, this year and wrote another one last Friday but we have not received any reply,&quot; Banda complained. &quot;We requested for a national meeting to discuss national issues and they said they were too busy to arrange one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apathy has marred the registration of voters ever since the exercise started forcing the Electoral office to seek the participation of various<BR>governmental and non-governmental organisations in raising public awareness</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Post of Zambia<BR>December 27, 1995<BR>by Sipo Kapumba</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Economic Association of Zambia (EAZ) programme officer,<BR>Muna Nakalonga, said in an interview yesterday that the dilly dallying<BR>by the government on the sale of ZCCM may be out of political<BR>considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nakalonga said retrenchments on the copper mines were a political issue<BR>which the government may be trying to avoid. &quot;There is a loss of jobs associated with privatisation,&quot; Nakalonga said.&quot;They probably feel once they<BR>privatise lots of jobs will be lost.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But acting mines permanent secretary Albert Kashimu, in an interview<BR>yesterday, disagreed with Nakalonga. &quot;I disagree that the government is dilly dallying over the mines,&quot; Kashimu said. &quot;Everything is going according to<BR>schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Kashimu refused to elaborate of the time-table for the sale of the<BR>mines saying this was covered adequately by the President on ZNBC Nightline<BR>Radio programme on Sunday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba said on Nightline that teams had been appointed to address the declining copper production and improve operations of the<BR>smelter at Nchanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nakalonga, however, said ZCCM needed to be privatised quickly to stop any<BR>further declines in production which have resulted from the lack of fresh capital injection into the mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government has to be clear on the privatisation of ZCCM because it is a matter of life and death,&quot; Nakalonga said. Early this month at the Consultative Group Meeting in London discussing Zambia's request for more aid,<BR>donor countries and lending institutions urged the government to &quot;advance<BR>as rapidly as possible&quot; over the sale of ZCCM. They also urged the government to address ZCCM's declining production and revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Results for the quarter ended September 30 this year published by ZCCM on<BR>December 7 showed that 73,625 tonnes of copper were produced in this quarter<BR>compared to 94,093 tonnes during the same period last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decline in production was attributed, by ZCCM management and directors, to poor ore grades, lack of acid for the smelter at Nchanga and<BR>equipment problems.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Post of Zambia<BR>December 26, 1995<BR>by Masautso Phiri</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Listening to President Chiluba's speech at the MMD<BR>convention and his answers to Ben Kangwa's questions on the ZNBC&quot;S Night Line<BR>programme, I am glad to say we are at last getting somewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Listening to President Chiluba I was reminded of a hairy chested<BR>man covered in plaster and is asked by the doctor whether the plaster should be removed in one sharp jerk or in short cautious ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have said we are getting somewhere because some facts are being admitted by the President himself. He has agreed for instance that he changed his name from Titus Mpundu to Frederick Chiluba, though for politeness sake he calls this dropping the 'title' because Mpundu is not a name. He admits too that this happened in the 1960's when the acquisition of National Registration Cards was a must.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The blurb of his book Democracy the Challenge of Change he admits that the name stuck until his late teens. From this admission we can safely conclude that President Chiluba attended schools in Luapula as Titus Mpundu until he was expelled in early 1961. But between what he admits on the blurb of his book and his statement on the Night Line programme there is a small discrepancy. If we have to accept that he was born in 1943 as he claims and not in 1944 as his biological father Luka Chabala says, he was 19 on April 30, 1962. Two years before Zambia's independence in 1964 and four years before it became compulsory to obtain NRCs in 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leaving aside this discrepancy I am interested in other admissions by the<BR>President. At least, now we know he does not have a form two certificate.<BR>Addressing delegates to the just ended MMD convention Chiluba told his listeners he did not need a form two certificate which he claimed was a UNIP<BR>document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He asked his audience to look at his '0' and 'A' level certificates and his Master degree in political science. He also told his audience, he regards<BR>himself as a scholar, a great scholar. But what interests me further about<BR>Chiluba's admission is his failure to answer Ben Kangwa's simple question on Night Line programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KANGWA: Mr President I would also want to know from you sir, why<BR>this clash between you and The Post, especially citizenship and alleged form<BR>two certificate. Do you actually have a form two certificate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CHILUBA: Oh I've 'A' levels. I have '0' levels. I have better<BR>qualifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Looking at this answer I am now not surprised he told his MMD<BR>delegates he did not need to be in a classroom. He would have failed for not<BR>answering the question asked. But it is now obvious that Chiluba does not have a form two certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any case, the late National Party chairman Arthur Wina did<BR>disclose to me that his investigations at the ministry of education yielded<BR>nothing regards Chiluba's form two certificate. Now without a form two certificate Chiluba or Titus Mpundu would not have studied for his '0' or 'A' levels, so is the President trying to tell us that his dropping of Mpundu was necessitated by the borrowed certificate from the real Frederick Chiluba?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another admission is that he grew up in Luapula. The word he uses is 'transfer' to Luapula where the relatives of his mother were, at what point<BR>did this transfer from Wusakile to Luapula occur? How old was he? At a press<BR>conference earlier this year Chiluba talked about growing up on the mines?  When was this? I have noticed with interest that both Chiluba and his 'relatives' are good at avoiding mentioning years, is this deliberate or a lapse of memory?</SPAN></P>

The Settlement Plan for Western Sahara, which was accepted by the two parties on 30 August 1988 and approved by the Council on 27 June 1990 in its resolution 658 (1990), entails the holding of a referendum without military or administrative constraints, to enable the people of Western Sahara to choose between independence and integration with Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the referendum was originally scheduled for January 1992, the<BR>parties diverge on some elements of the plan, including the question of criteria for eligibility to vote in the referendum. The Plan provides for the lodging of appeals against the inclusion or exclusion of any names in the list of eligible voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The identification and registration operation has proved to be more complex than was expected, as members of the same tribal subgroups, who must be identified individually with the assistance of their respective sheikhs, were dispersed in different locations and means of communication were limited. The Identification Commission for the Referendum in Western Sahara was established in 1993 to facilitate the process of identification and registration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General in his report states that the identification will continue as before in the case of 85 out of 88 tribal subgroups which are listed in the census of 1974 and for which a list of sheikhs and alternates has already been established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the case of the three remaining census groups, and in those instances where identification takes place outside the Territory and the Tindouf area, he proposes that the Government of Morocco and the POLISARIO be invited to present a sheikh, or alternate of the subgroup concerned to assist in the identification process. An observer of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) is also expected to attend. The absence of a sheikh, representative or observer, for whatever reason, will not prevent identification from proceeding after the schedule for identification has been communicated to the parties, the convocation lists have been issued and the hours of work announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If neither party makes available a sheikh or alternate, identification will be based on appropriate documentation. In all cases, according to the report, there will be no change in the procedure already established, which reflects the relevant provisions of the Settlement Plan and the compromise proposal with respect to oral testimony and documentary evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General states that it will be up to the Identification Commission to determine the validity of the oral testimony and of the documentary evidence and to decide on the merits of each applicant to be included in the electoral roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Commission will be able to carry out its work only if both parties place their trust in its judgement and integrity. The Secretary-General warns that neither party is likely to be satisfied with his proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morocco wants to limit the role of documentary evidence and give privilege to that of oral testimony. The POLISARIO considers that the proposed new approach will allow for the introduction of applicants who have no ties to Western Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General, however, concludes that the new approach is the only way the process can be carried forward. Should the identification operation fail to proceed with the necessary speed, it is the intention of the Secretary-General to present for the consideration of the Council, alternative options, including the possibility of the withdrawal of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter to the President of the Council (document S/1995/924) on 27 October, the Secretary-General informed the Council of decisions taken to accelerate identification. To that date, procedures required that identification take place only in the presence of a representative of each of the parties, a sheikh nominated by each party and an observer of the OAU In many cases identification has had to be suspended, or had not started, because of the absence of one or more of those persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General explains that to that point identification had taken place in the Territory and in the camps near Tindouf and in the Tindouf area. Some work remained to be done in those areas, but most of the other applicants were resident in Morocco and Mauritania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A comprehensive effort would be launched in all those areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the case of the 85 tribal subgroups for which the list of sheikhs and alternates had already been established, the previous practice would be followed at identification centres inside the Territory and in the camps, with the following exception. If a party representative, a sheikh and/or the OAU observer was absent, identification would nevertheless proceed provided the schedule for identification had been duly communicated to the parties, the convocation lists had been issued and the hours of work had been announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the case of three other tribal groupings and in the case of all identification which took place outside the Territory and the camps, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> procedure would be modified, the letter said In those areas also, identification would proceed even if a party representative, a sheikh and/or the OAU observer was absent While the sheikh who was present would be able to assist in identifying the applicant, the latter's claim for inclusion in the electoral role would be evaluated on the basis of documentary evidence: a birth certificate issued by the competent authorities in the country of the applicant's birth to substantiate that he or she is the child of a father born in the Territory or has other links with the Territory; and a document issued by the competent authorities within the internationally recognized frontiers of the Territory before 1974 to substantiate the father's birth in the Territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General states that both parties and the OAU had been informed of those decisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -Statement by the ANC Youth League on the Matriculation Results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now that the 1995 matriculation results have been announced, the African National Congress Youth League urges the matriculants who have passed to grab the opportunities the new democracy has opened up for them. We applaud them for their achievements and wish them well in the future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We appeal to institutions of higher learning to open their doors to them. We urge that no aspirant student be turned away from any of our universities and technikons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We urge funding organisations and other financial institutions to generously assist students in need of financial assistance to proceed with their studies. We also urge students to make use of the resources made available by the Government of National Unity for study purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To those students who have not made it we appeal to them to work harder next year. There is always a reward for greater efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We applaud the Minister of Education, Professor Sibusiso Bengu, and the different MECs for the historic achievement of this year. For the first time in the history of the country, there has been no racial division in the release of matriculation results. We have to add on to this momentous achievement in the coming years by increasing our pass percentage. The must crucial players in this regard will be the students themselves and their teachers. The government has to play a facilitating role to ensure that the climate is established for that to be achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the coming year, let us build on the maturing culture of learning in our schools. Let us stamp out crime and drug abuse, practices which are still prevalent in our schools, and work harder to achieve better results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC Youth League views the general state of the matriculation results for 1995 as representing a curve in the direction of stabilisation in our schools, more especially at a secondary level. We believe that in the coming years there will be a steady increase in the pass rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC Youth League commits itself to work much harder and more closely with the education authorities and other bodies, including student organisations, to ensure that 1996 becomes an even better year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC Youth League advises political parties and organisations to assist the Minister of Education and the MECs to achieve the results every South African desires for our country and our children. The time for political point scoring on matters of national importance as crucial as the future of our children has passed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations -SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN BURUNDI SUBMITS INITIAL REPORT: Testimony Appears To Indicate Smoldering Civil War May Be Spreading in Burundi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights mandated to examine the human rights situation in Burundi, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, in his initial report, emphasizes that, according to evidence provided to him, a smoldering civil war was spreading further and further in Burundi. The situation had in particular deteriorated since the beginning of the year, and significantly so since May. The general climate of insecurity, fear and hatred affected all segments of the population, both Hutus and Tutsis, and had led to a renewed breakout of violence committed by extremists on both sides, leading to the death of soldiers and many civilians each week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aggression, assassination and massacres, torture or arbitrary detention were the daily lot of the Burundi people. The Special Rapporteur noted, among other things, that complete impunity was still enjoyed in Burundi. The insecurity and grave violations of human rights were increasing constantly throughout the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Mr. Pinheiro, the ethnic tension between Hutu and Tutsi was reflected in the Government, in which the number of cases of blockage between the two ethnic groups had increased. This accentuated the lack of effectiveness at all levels of State activity, whether it was a question of maintenance of security and order in the country, the administration of justice, the functioning of the army or the police forces, the economic management of the country or the conducting of education at all levels, from primary to university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the view of the Special Rapporteur, this state of affairs was also due to the inertia -- even complicity -- on the part of broad segments of the ruling classes in Burundi, the criminal responsibility of extremist groups of all ethnic origins, as well as the slow international response to the need to aid the country's moderate political forces to overcome the crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite its recognition of the horrors committed in the country, particularly after the events of October 1993, the international community continued to demonstrate a profound indifference and a grave inability to act in a concrete and effective manner, according to the Special Rapporteur.  Burundi's institutions were deteriorating and arms were being smuggled into the interior of the country as in the border regions. Also, certain media, in Burundi as well as in the neighbouring countries, were transmitting unrelenting messages of hatred aimed at destabilizing the country. By its attitude of omission, the international community had, for the greater part, allowed the development of the extremism raging in Burundi. It had also contributed to the progressive deterioration of the country's socio-economic infrastructures, rendering economic survival more and more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, the converging political and social factors underlined a real danger that the deteriorating situation could explode any time in the country, with consequences as grave as those seen previously in Rwanda. In this regard, the tensions provoked by the refugees or displaced and dispersed persons and the &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; operations frequently could result in the concentration of the Tutsi population in the urban zones and the forced migration of the Hutus to the rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among his recommendations, the Special Rapporteur stresses that the administration of justice must be reformed as a matter of urgency to combat impunity, possibly through the assistance of magistrates from other African countries. He further recommends that measures be adopted to combat insecurity in the country, particularly by creating a national rapid alert mechanism which could prevent violence from degenerating into massacre or genocide. Also, measures must be taken to reinforce the civil society of Burundi by supporting the efforts of local non-governmental organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appropriate assistance had to be allocated to the development of the media, particularly by training journalists in accordance with the ethics of the profession. The Special Rapporteur requested the strengthening of the United Nations human rights office at Bujumbura and the acceleration of the process of deployment of human rights observers in Burundi, as provided by resolution 1995/90 of the Commission on Human Rights. The Rapporteur stressed the necessity to set up a close coordination between the three Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on Rwanda, Zaire and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Pinheiro was appointed Special Rapporteur last April, in conformity with resolution 1995/90 of the Commission on Human Rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations -LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have the honour to refer to the statement by the President of the Security Council of 9 March 1995 (S/PRST/1995/10) requesting me to continue to keep the Security Council fully informed of developments in Burundi. In this connection, I should like to share with you my deep concern about the persistence of violence and the further escalation of human rights violations communicated to me in recent reports from the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office of my Special Representative in Bujumbura and other sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of June 1995, the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the human rights situation in Burundi, Mr. Paolo Sergio Pinheiro, undertook a visit to the country. According to his report, Burundi is the scene of a smouldering civil war. The situation has continued to deteriorate since May 1995 and is characterized by daily killings, massacres, torture and arbitrary detention. The human rights situation &quot;reveals an increasingly marked genocidal trend of a socio-ethnic nature&quot; and perpetrators are still enjoying impunity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the light of his findings, the Special Rapporteur puts forward a number of recommendations ranging from the consolidation of democratic institutions and the reform of the judicial system to the establishment of a national police force accepted by both communities and the deployment of human rights observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deteriorating situation is underscored by recent decisions of international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the World Food Programme and most non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to curtail or suspend their activities in Burundi following a spate of violent attacks against their personnel and assets.  Furthermore, Burundi's borders with Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania have remained closed for several days. There are also recent reports of a crowd numbering several thousand gathering in the vicinity of the Presidential Palace in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the existing circumstances, I fear there is a real danger of the situation in Burundi degenerating to the point where it might explode into ethnic violence on a massive scale. In view of the extremely grave consequences of such an explosion, I should like to recall once more the proposals I made to the Security Council on 19 August 1994 and repeated in my report of 11 October 1994 (S/1994/1152).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In particular, I suggested the maintenance in Zaire, subject to the agreement of the Zairian Government, of a military presence capable of intervening rapidly in the event of a sudden deterioration of the situation in Burundi, a preventive measure that could help to avoid a repetition of the tragic events in Rwanda. My proposals also included the deployment of a contingent of guards, similar to those sent to Iraq, to protect the humanitarian organization teams; and the deployment of human rights observers as recommended by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur and several other missions that visited Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of the worsening situation, the Security Council may now wish to give renewed consideration to my proposals for preventive deployment of military personnel and guards. As for the deployment of human rights observers, I regret to inform you that the High Commissioner for Human Rights has not yet been in a position to secure the necessary funds for this purpose despite numerous and repeated appeals to potential donor Governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of the seriousness of the situation, I have asked the High Commissioner for Refugees, Ms. Sadako Ogata, to travel immediately to Bujumbura as my personal envoy in order to discuss with the government authorities, at the highest level, steps that might be taken on an urgent basis to defuse the situation and enable international organizations to function effectively. I shall inform the Security Council about the outcome of Ms. Ogata's mission as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, I should like to confirm that my new Special Representative for Burundi, Mr. Marc Faguy, left for Bujumbura on 28 December 1995 and will assume his functions there with immediate effect, upon his arrival on 30 December 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tunis - In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow-citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is with great pleasure that I take the opportunity offered me by the new year to express to you my warmest congratulations and my best wishes, praying God to make this year one of abundance and prosperity for Tunisia and for all Tunisia's citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This occasion allows me once again to say how determined we are to continue strengthening our gains, enriching our accomplishments, confirming our country's invulnerability, and raising it to a favored position among developed peoples.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In pursuing this effort our approach will, as always, take support from the strengthened cohesiveness of our people, the solidarity of all members and categories of the population, the necessity for continued self-reliance, and perseverance in completing the reforms we have undertaken in the different sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The year we are now entering marks the beginning of a decisive stage in our development process, in the sense that we have set ourselves the goal of achieving widespread upgrading by the beginning of the next century, and have begun preparing all sectors and fields to integrate themselves into this ambitious national program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have also regarded our human resources as an effective practical instrument for meeting this challenge, through judicious use of our energies and potential; the devising of better methods of work, organization and training; constant, lucid adaptation to progress in science, in knowledge and techniques of communications and technology, in the establishment of channels for exchange with regional groups and world markets; and consistent interaction with our environment and with our time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fellow-citizens,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national and regional consultations we launched last year to explore prospects for the next century and to prepare for implementation of the Ninth Development Plan illustrate well the resolutely democratic option of the Change of 7th November, calling for a contribution by all the country's parties, organizations and skills, who participated in these consultations and shared their viewpoints and suggestions regarding our country's prospects for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We shall continue to follow this approach at all levels during the coming year, to provide all the country's active forces with greater opportunities for participating in public life and to strengthen every citizen's sense of responsibility to accomplish his or her duty to society and in the service of the general interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just as we are anxious to create every possible condition for enriching economic development, so also are we working to ensure that human and economic development are interrelated and complementary. For that reason we continue to devote considerable attention to education, training, employment, health care coverage, public housing, the promotion of disadvantaged regions, and the protection of the poor, the aged and the handicapped, so that no Tunisian man or woman will be excluded from the advantages provided by our reforms and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the coming year, social negotiations will begin among the professional organizations concerned.  It is our hope that these negotiations will, as usual, confirm the path of dialogue and consensus, in a spirit that ensures constant respect of the country's interests and the safeguarding of the rights of all parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amidst the changes and challenges that characterize every sphere of life in the world today, each of us must contribute his or her share of labour and accomplishment, so as to endow our country with the means by which it may enter the next century having reached the level we aspire to in terms of security, serenity and progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fellow-citizens,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the beginning of this new year, we express once again our hopes for a strengthening of the peace processes in the Middle East and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for confirmation of the harmony among all Arab nations, for reinforcement of the Arab Maghreb Union, for enhanced understanding and cooperation in international relations, and for the propagation of security and peace throughout the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we reiterate our wishes for happiness on the occasion of this New Year, we also address to all the members of our colony abroad, and to our brothers, citizens of Maghreb, Arab and Muslim countries, our sincere congratulations, as we pray God that we may celebrate many further such occasions, in well-being and success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wish you all, and I wish Tunisia, a happy and successful new year.</SPAN></P>
