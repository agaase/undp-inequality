#### How does Conflict affect Inequality in Africa?

Countries in Africa have gone through a number of conflicts since their independence from colonial rule.  Violence due  to conflicts not only results in deaths and destruction of property, but a greater collateral damage leading to a complete breakdown of society. With this visualization, I try to understand different drivers of societal inequality due to conflict violence.

 > Research Question

 > I am studying the nature of ethnic conflicts in sub-saharan africa because I want to find out what are the different types of conflicts and what causes them in order to understand how the nature of conflicts hamper the growth and inequality of a country or in this case the whole SSA. I am using variables related to conflicts such as type of conflict, duration and intensity. My visualization is based on [Uppsala Conflict Data Program] (http://ucdp.uu.se/) data.

### Qualitative Asssignment -

#### Causes and Impact of Conflicts in Africa : What have Scholars researched?

With this project I try to understand what kind of research academic scholars have carried out around conflicts in Africa specifically related to its impact and cause. For this I analyse top 1000 search results from  [Google Academic Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=africa+conflict&hl=en&as_sdt=1,33&as_ylo=1960&as_yhi=2010&as_vis=1) for each year between 1970-2016. Each search result is analysed for its headline to understand its focus which is ultimately aggregated with all other results to find a larger focus over a time period.  

 > Research Question

 > I am studying the Google Scholar results (e.g [here](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=980&q=africa+conflict&hl=en&as_sdt=1,33&as_ylo=1960&as_yhi=1960&as_vis=1)) on the search keyword - "Africa and Conflict" because I want to find out what research was done over the years on that topic in order to know what were the impacts and causes of conflicts in Africa as perceived by the research community. I am using variables related to conflicts such as crisis, war, ethnicity, coup etc to  make my results more relevant.

## UNDP Questions

- While trying to find a list ethnic groups in Africa, the data set I found  [here](https://worldmap.harvard.edu/data/geonode:GREG_0vV)  and  [here](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cc2324e45ace44d09c333b4b4a1c14a3#data); both have their source of data as the  Atlas Narodov Mira (1964). However one research paper [here]() points out - "the Atlas only provides a list of population by ethnicity with no documentation of its methodology" and many others (one example [here](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9411.pdf)) have questioned its validity. Can we use this data at its face value without really understanding its methodology?



## Data Review
### Selected data sources

#### 1. Table 2: Sectoral breakdown of economic activity in Africa, 1990, 2000 and 2010-2012 (Page 13, Growth, Poverty and Inequality Interactions in Africa: An Overview of Key Issues)

This table provides the breakdown of economic activity in Africa. What would be interesting to visualize is the relationship between manufacturing and inequality for Africa and rest of the world.

Questions

Is it always safe to assume that a transition towards manufacturing industries will always lead to more positive growth in a country or there are caveats to this assumption?

#### 2. Ethnic fractionalisation in Africa - Using data from 18 SSA countries, Jackson (2013) shows that, in ethnically diverse communities, access to water, electricity and education is lower. (Page 13, Growth, Poverty and Inequality Interactions in Africa: An Overview of Key Issues)

With this data set it would be interesting to explorw how the ethnic groups are leading to more inequality in Africa and probably also how history or the colonial rule led to the state of inequality as it is today by causing ethnic fractionalisation.

Questions

Can you quantify the impact of ethnic clash within a country ? If there are several clashes of a severe nature, how will it impact the inequality?

#### 3. Figure 7. Estimated impact on the Gini coe cient of additional income that escapes the national accounts, Côte d’Ivoire, 2008 (Page 15, Building the integrated inequality database and the seven sins of inequality measurement in Sub-Saharan Africa)

We already know that capital flights would lead to further increase of Gini coefficient but what we are interested to know is that how the distribution of capital flight between different countries would look like. Are there specific countries where there is a huge impact and which in turn with it brings along other additional consequences.

Questions

Does capital flight has a double effect on the inequality within the country? 1. The money it generates would increase the income of the rich by some percent and 2. If its illegal money (and mostly it is) it deprives the redistribution of the same money as tax benefit or other schemes to the poor? If that is the case how can quantify the second effect?

#### 4. Figure 8. Monthly consumer price of millet (CFAF/gg): 2005 vs. 2004 and average 2000-2004 (Page 15, Building the integrated inequality database and the seven sins of inequality measurement in Sub-Saharan Africa)

There are three biases while calculating the GINI coefficient using the consumption expenditure per household

- all households pay the same price for all goods included in CPI consumption and changes over time in prices affect all households in the same way
- consumption are generally recorded on a monthly or weekly basis assuming implicitly that such prices are stable through out the year.

What would be interesting to see is how the variation of inequality would look like in a year. If there is a lot of variation then the effective Gini coefficient should be up from its current level. For this we can take the food prices for multiple years and see how that would have effected the actual level of GINI.
