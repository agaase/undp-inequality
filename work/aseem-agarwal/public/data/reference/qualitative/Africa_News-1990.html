<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberian government troops are indiscriminately killing villagers in a crackdown against rebels in Nimba county in the northeast of the country, according to exiled government opponents and refugees who have fled into neighboring countries. The rebels, said to number about 100, entered the country from Cote d'Ivoire on December 24, They, too, have apparently been killing civilians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 35,000 Liberians are reported to have fled into Cote d'Ivoire to escape the fighting, and another 13,000 have arrived in Guinea.  Amnesty International has called upon the government to stop extra-judicial killings by government forces. Last week, Liberian President Sam Doe warned soldiers they would face severe penalties if they harassed civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has responded to the invasion by arresting opposition political figures in the capital, Monrovia, which has been untouched by the fighting. Two members of the Liberian Action Party have been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nimba County has been a center of opposition to Doe's rule, but the uprising there is not connected to any of the established political movements.  The rebel leader is Charles Taylor, who fled Liberia in 1986 amid accusations of embezzlement. But he was detained in the U.S. where he jumped bail while facing extradition proceedings, Reuters reports.</SPAN></P>

Based on several months of interviews with Somali refugees, the report calls for &quot;decisive&quot; international intervention to halt the violence that has plagued Somalia under the military rule of Mohamed Siad Barre. Africa Watch says that if world opinion becomes aware of the tragedy in the north-east African nation, it will find &quot;the anguish of its people&quot; impossible to ignore.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been a wave of strikes this month in Mozambique, where labor action has been rare. The strikes began on December 28, when more than two dozen journalists walked out at the weekly newsmagazine Tempo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then there has been strike actions by dockers, railway, factory and construction workers, city employees and hospital staff. Some of the strikes, like those at steel and textile mills, were resolved in a few hours. But a walk-out and picketing by nurses and support staff at the country's second largest hospital in the port city of Beira caused wards to close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actions have been prompted by an economic adjustment program that has devalued the currency, pushed prices up and left employers unable to pay year-end bonuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of President Joaquim Chissano, which has outlined a draft constitution that will guarantee workers the right to strike, has taken a moderate position on the disruptions. A statement released by government ministries said the workers' demands were just, but it also said that strikes which endanger lives and the national economy are &quot;immoral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed new constitution, based on recommendations from the ruling Frelimo party's fifth Congress in July, includes a lengthy list of citizens' rights and freedoms and provides for a nationally-elected president who will be limited to three five-year terms. Currently, government officials are elected by a tiered system, beginning with popular votes at the local level, with each elected body choosing representatives to the next level, ending with the national Peoples' Assembly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka: In a move Zambians are regarding with mixed feelings, Canadian banker Jacques Bussieres has taken up his post as governor of the Bank of Zambia. The appointment is widely viewed as a failure by 65-year-old President Kenneth Kaunda to appoint qualified Zambians to the critical post.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Zambia's independence in 1964, each bank governor's term has lasted only about two and a half years. In the past three years, 11 senior officials of the bank have been sacked for corruption or incompetence.  Bussieres' predecessor, Francis Nkhoma, has appeared in magistrate's court here charged with five counts of corruption and contravention of foreign exchange regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With debts that total over $ 1,000 per capita and inflation hovering around 130%, Zambia's government needs a massive injection of hard currency.  Although Kaunda says the decision to appoint Bussiere was his own, sources here say it was one of the conditions for reaching agreement with the International Monetary Fund for new loans. Zambian officials are due to hold meetings in Paris in March with representatives of the Fund, the World Bank and other international donors and lenders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several typographical errors cropped up in the review of V.Y.  Mudimbe's book, The Invention of Africa, in the last issue of 1989.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them, which probably left attentive readers shaking their heads, dropped a phrase in quoting a 1965 reissue of Mary Kingsley's Travels in West Africa. Our sentence has Kingsley making the comment in 1965. Since her African travels took place a century ago, any recent pronouncement by Mary Kingsley would have been bigger news than we made of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those interested in the impressions of a modern traveler who followed Kingsley's footsteps, the London firm Bloomsbury has published One Dry Season, an account of West African travels by Caroline Alexander.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Devotees of the British Broadcasting Corporation's Africa reporting can now keep up with the coverage, even when sunspots impede the reception. To mark the Africa Service's 50th anniversary this year, the BBC has launched a quarterly magazine named after the Service's 30-year-old flagship program, Focus on Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magazine's editor, Robin White, who also edits the radio program, says he expects regular publication to begin this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, an inaugural issue is giving readers a glimpse of the qualities that have won the Africa Service a loyal listenership over the years: sophisticated design, writing that integrates a lively personal style into the reporting, and a spirited dialogue with the audience. What the printed version of Focus loses in you-are-there sound, it gains in vivid photography. Copies of the special issue are available for $ 3.00 each from the BBC, Bush House, LondonWC 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, who is teaching at Dartmouth, is publishing a new monthly called African Commentary.  The journal will, Achebe says, invite leading writers and scholars from around the world to &quot;meditate on the condition of Africans and of people of African descent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Achebe says the magazine's staff is committed both &quot;to reclaiming the rich heritage of Africa&quot; and to pondering &quot;the question of Africa's and the Black's place in the world today.&quot; Out of the complex mix of perspectives that will be presented, he says, there will emerge &quot;a sound, clear vision of the way forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos -- Nigeria's feisty press, easily the liveliest in Africa, is a study in paradox. Hemmed in by various restrictive laws, constantly under the watchful eye of the military government and buffeted by a severe newsprint scarcity, the press in Africa's most populous country manages to maintain a reputation for freedom and high quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press tradition is an old one. Newspapers began publishing in Nigeria on December 3, 1859, 100 years before the West African country became independent from Britain. The first paper, Iwe Irohin Yoruba, &quot;Newspaper for the Yoruba&quot; was established by the Reverend Henry Townsend, an Anglican missionary, in Abeokuta, western Nigeria. It sold for 120 cowries -- about $ .01-- and carried news of church activities, trade reports, marriage announcements and post office notices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today there is a riot of over 100 newspapers and magazines. The serious dailies include the government owned Daily Times and New Nigerian, and the privately owned Guardian, National Concord, Punch and Vanguard. Privately owned news magazines include Newswatch, The African Guardian and African Concord. Human interest magazines include Quality and muckrakers such as Vintage People and Climax -- African versions of the American National Enquirer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proliferation of publications has spurred the emergence of a new generation of journalists -- better paid and more educated, in response to an increasingly critical readership, and more respected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some aspects of the negative image of journalists remain, notably the &quot;brown envelope&quot; phenomenon -- the buying of publicity through cash &quot;gifts&quot; to journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the government owns most dailies, an increasingly significant proportion is owned by private individuals and organizations, unlike in most African countries. However, radio and television are still wholly owned and controlled by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite long stretches of military dictatorship, the Nigerian press prides itself as being the freest on the continent. Sven Harold Jurchewsky, a Canadian diplomat who recently served in Lagos, says the degree of press freedom in Nigeria is remarkable. &quot;You have a freer press than most places in the world&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, that freedom is provisional. &quot;This Government Has AIDS&quot; screamed a recent headline in The New Horizon, a leftist Lagos magazine, quoting Gani Fawehinmi, a leading government critic and human rights lawyer.  Perhaps only in Nigeria, of all the military-ruled African countries, could a newspaper carry such a banner. But Fawehinmi was arrested and is being tried under a law which forbids statements that could &quot;jeopardize&quot; the military government's program of transition to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That process is at a delicate stage. Last December, the military government of General Ibrahim Babangida announced that none of the six new political parties which had been formed to contest the elections scheduled for 1992 had &quot;qualified.&quot; The government, itself, he said, would organize two national parties, free of the corruption and backroom wheeling and dealing that had characterized previous civilian governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many politicians were dismayed, other observers were impressed with the abrupt move, which they hoped would curb influence buying and make the campaign process more truly democratic. Ray Ekpu, editor-in-chief of Newswatch magazine, which has often been a vocal -- and besieged -- government critic, called Babangida's action a &quot;master stroke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the Nigerian press really free? Ray Ekpu, of Newswatch , says that compared to many other African countries, the Nigerian press is better off.  &quot;But then,&quot; he says, &quot;Africa can be compared to the community where there is no maiden.&quot; In such a community, according to Nigerian folklore, old women are regarded as maidens. &quot;In the context of the African press -- where there are no maidens,&quot; Ekpu says, &quot;Nigeria is its maiden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various laws, enforced irregularly and selectively, hang like a Sword of Damocles over the Nigerian press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Official Secrets Act of 1962 prohibits the reproduction or retention of &quot;classified matter&quot; by, or the transmission of such classified matter to &quot;an unauthorized person.&quot; Matters are &quot;classified&quot; and persons are &quot;unauthorized&quot; as defined by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although rarely invoked, the law discourages investigative journalism concerning government activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, the military government of Major-General Muhammadu Buhari enacted Decree 4, a law allowing jail terms for journalists who publish reports that &quot;embarrass&quot; the government. Two reporters, Nduke Irabor and Tunde Thompson, both of the Guardian, were jailed under the law for prematurely publishing a list of government ambassadorial nominees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a time, the Babangida government, which took power in 1985, enjoyed a honeymoon with the press. But the romance had turned sour by April 1987, when Newswatch was proscribed for six months for publishing a secret document on Nigeria's political transition to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree -- popularly known as Decree 2 -- has been the most recent government instrument for muzzling the press. Under the decree, the government can detain anyone indefinitely and without trial for &quot;reasons of state security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another law -- The Media Council Decree of 1988 -- has generated such a furor that it has been inoperable. It provides for an 18 member media council whose chairperson and secretary, along with ten other council members, are appointed by the country's president. The Nigerian Union of Journalists will have just four representatives, and the Newspaper Proprietors Association and the Guild of Editors will each have two. The council will have the power to register and de-register journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predictably, Nigerian journalists have rebelled against the decree, although the government-owned press, which cannot protest as loudly as the private press, has kept out of the fray. Pini Jason, editor of a national newsmonthly, compared the legislation with South Africa's recent abortive attempts to &quot;licence&quot; journalists through registration requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when the laws themselves are not employed, journalists who publish what the authorities regard as offensive articles are regularly invited for &quot;chats&quot; -- a euphemism for brief detentions -- with security agents. Thus, many editors tread softly, imposing substantial self-censorship. But if there is worry here about government controls, there is concern, too, about the effect that civilian rule will have on the press. The time-worn cliche, &quot;He who pays the piper dictates the tune&quot; applies to private as well as government-owned newspapers. Editors who wish to retain their jobs avoid running stories that contradict the views of their proprietors, whether they be government or not. With the coming of civilian rule, many journalists are fearful that their papers will become -- as has happened in the past -- mere mouthpieces for the political views of their various owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if the problem of retaining editorial independence is not enough of a headache, Nigeria's press has been adversely affected by the country's economic structural adjustment program. The devaluation of the country's currency, the naira, has made it difficult for the Nigerian Newspaper Manufacturing Company to afford the importation of raw ma-terials, leading to severe shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The little newsprint available is costly. High paper prices have meant expensive newspapers on the streets, leading to reduced demand. Prices have more than doubled, with newspapers selling for N1.00 ($ .15), up from 50 kobo ($ .07) before the economic reform program. Erratic fluctuations in the naira's value, which also affects the price of newsprint, have made rational planning by publishers difficult. Numerous publications have been forced out of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the daunting problems, most Nigerian journalists believe that their publications have largely lived up to their role as a watchdog for the people, even while they have maintained an emphasis, common to less industrialized countries, on &quot;development&quot; coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the price has been high.  Journalists have discovered that, all too often, the sword is mightier than the pen. Late in 1986, Dele Giwa, the crusading founding editor of Newswatch was killed by a parcel bomb delivered to his home. Nobody has been charged with the murder, which has cast a pall over the efforts of other investigative journalists, who never know what reaction to expect when they break an important story. As Newswatch wrote in an editorial after its 1987 ban was lifted, practising journalism in Nigeria is like &quot;walking blindfold through a minefield.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka -- Zambia's annual population growth rate of 3.7% -- one of the highest in Africa -- has become a major source of concern to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its independence in 1964, Zambia could afford to offer its three million citizens free medical care and education as well as subsidized food.  Today, the country has a population of 7.5 million and is unable to provide them with even basic services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the problem is that Zambia, like many African countries, is heavily reliant on the export of commodities, whose prices fluctuate unpredictably on international markets. Copper, which provides 80% of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings, has dropped precipitously since the mid-1970s, despite a modest recovery last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is a severe strain on health, housing and education.  Thousands of children are being denied advancement beyond seventh grade because of limited places in secondary schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little the government can do to control copper prices. But it has begun to take firm measures to stem the population boom. Officials here have been formulating a policy designed to reduce the population growth rate to 3.4% by the year 2000 and to 2.5% by 2015. In its early stages, the program should enhance health and welfare by preventing premature deaths and illnesses, especially among mothers and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government says the population policy will play a central role in national development strategies. The goal is to integrate a consideration of population factors into all development planning and to assure the right of every couple and individual to freely and responsibly decide on the number and spacing of their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, a privately-funded organization, the Environment and Population Center, has been formed to increase awareness of population issues among both policy makers and the general public. The group says it wants to dramatize the adverse effects of unchecked population growth, such as indiscriminate exploitation of the country's natural resources and the degradation of the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian government policy aims to slow population growth by initiating new measures and by improving and sustaining those already in place. Among the components of the new plan are a national program of education and assistance for family planning and an expansion of the country's population data base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Environment and Population Center will conduct briefings, seminars and workshops. It plans to produce and distribute information on such topical issues as women's reproductive health, women in development, the place of the child in society, adolescent pregnancy, migration patterns, deforestation and erosion trends, environmental protection and pollution control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Center's chair, Willa Mung'omba, a former president of the African Development Bank, says there are good reasons for linking population and environmental questions and for being concerned about both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The major one,&quot; he says, &quot;is that the economies of the Third World are not growing as fast as their populations.&quot; In Zambia, if the current population growth rate is maintained until the year 2010, the country's population will more than double to about 15 million people. &quot;To maintain a decent and satisfactory life,&quot; Mung'omba says, &quot;the rate of economic growth will need to grow much faster that it has done since 1964.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this does not happen,&quot; Mung'omba warns, &quot;we are likely to have a much poorer society than we have today, less educated, malnourished and without adequate health facilities to look after itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mung'omba argues that the success of any population policy lies in the active participation of women. In most societies, women outnumber men, and most of them are poor. Because the poor in most countries have little influence over the course of national events, women are, in effect, powerless, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A country like Zambia, he says, where the biggest sector of women are always poor, powerless and pregnant, cannot hope to have sustained development without drawing women fully into the development process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the linkage between environment and population, Mung'omba says that the technological revolution that has produced unprecedented levels of economic growth and prosperity for the industrialized world also has exacted immense and growing costs. The environmental resource base of the planet is being degraded, risking its life support system and, therefore, human health and well being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are literally living off the earth's capital,&quot; Mung'omba warns, &quot;and that capital is being seriously depleted. If you are a businessman, you will understand that we cannot continue to run our planet this way any more than we could run a business for long by running down and living off its capital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the current rate of exploitation, the Center's director says, the earth is headed for bankruptcy. And just as &quot;a bankrupt company offers no hope for its employees, a bankrupt earth will leave its population lost and hopeless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mung'omba hopes that the Center's focus on both environmental and population problems will add a new dimension to the new national effort to curb Zambia's population growth and inform its people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only dramatic action can avert the continuing decline of African living standards during the 1990s, according to the latest assessment of Africa's economies by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA). But African planners are increasingly fearful that international events will further strain the continent's resources and blunt its ability to implement necessary reforms. The attention and financial resources being directed towards Eastern Europe are, to many Africans, a realization of those fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting preliminary figures for Africa's performance during 1989, ECA Executive-Secretary Adebayo Adedeji said the year will be most remembered as the end of a lost decade of development opportunities. In a January 15 statement at ECA headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Adedeji pointed to a rapid deterioration in social welfare and the disintegration of productive capacity and infrastructural facilities during the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989, Africa's GDP (its overall output of goods and services) grew by 2.9%. Although that was an improvement on the previous year's growth of 2.4%, per capita incomes continued to decline.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because population is rising faster than the rate of economic growth, the average person's income fell by 0.7% in 1988 and dropped 0.3% last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ECA figures portray a continent highly vulnerable to factors beyond its control. Much of last year's improved output is attributed to exceptionally good weather conditions. And because Africa's relatively small industrial sector is heavily reliant on agricultural materials, better agricultural performance contributed to increased manufacturing output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the challenges Africans must confront is the growing economic integration of Europe. Many fear that Africa, faced with a formidable new trading bloc, will become even less able to escape the legacy of colonialism, which left African countries with weak economies oriented towards producing the raw materials which fueled European growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A boom in prices for those commodities in the early post-colonial years encouraged African governments to plan -- and lenders to advance the funds -- for ambitious and often ill-conceived development projects. But steady declines in the world commodity market since the mid-1970s has left Africa saddled with debts it is unable to repay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of Africa's economic growth in 1989 is due to an improvement in some commodity prices. Higher international fuel prices boosted export earnings for the region's oil producers and countries like Zambia and Zaire have benefited from a rise in copper earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, prices for commodities that provide virtually all the foreign exchange earnings for many countries continued a downward plunge.  Leading the decline were cocoa and robusta coffee, the principle variety grown in Africa. Cocoa prices dropped nearly 17% last year while coffee fell by 12.5%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this environment, Adedeji said, the nations of Africa must look to their own resources and strengths. Echoing the themes of recent ECA and African proposals for economic recovery, Adedeji said African governments must implement a new generation of economic and political reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary document laying out the emerging African concensus on economic policies is the African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programs.  AAF-SAP, as it is called, says that African countries must curb spending, diversify exports, and switch expenditures to the most promising sectors for self-sufficiency, such as food production. And they must democratize the development process, including freeing women to participate more fully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AAF-SAP argues -- and Adedeji in his presentation emphasized -- that regional cooperation within Africa must replace some of the continent's dependence on the industrialized nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans must rely on themselves, Adedeji said. Donors can &quot;give a helping hand, and no more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, no one argues that Africa can recover -- or even arrest its decline -- on its own. Every plan that has been advanced for Africa, whether from Western financial institutions like the World Bank or Africa's own proposals, calls for increased levels of international assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that, say the analysts, is unlikely. In fact, total American assistance to sub-Saharan Africa for the last four years has already declined over the levels of the mid-1980s, dropping from just over $ 2 billion in 1985 toa proposed level of slightly more than $ 1 billion for this year (although emergency food aid could push the final total higher).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African leaders have watched with some uneasiness as events in Eastern Europe and Central America have monopolized media coverage of international affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What worries everybody,&quot; says Bertram Collins, who heads the Africa Recovery office at the United Nations, &quot;is that there may be a preoccupation with other parts of the world whose interests are now on the front pages of every newspaper and whose concerns will certainly attract a good deal of the attention of the world's leading policy makers -- and perhaps also a large part of the resources available for rehabilitation, reconstruction and development&quot; in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Congress late last year voted $ 840 million in economic assistance over the next three years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Poland and Hungary alone. President George Bush pledged that similar aid would flow to other Eastern European countries which adopt economic and political reforms, while talk was heard on Capitol Hill that Panama's needs would top $ 1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African worries about where those resources would be found were not soothed by public discussion of the issue in the U.S. In a series of interviews and statements, the Acting Director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Mark Edelman, has pointed out that in the new aid game, somebody has to lose. &quot;Money for Eastern Europe will come out of what would otherwise have gone to Central America, Africa and the Middle East,&quot; Edelman said, indicating that as many as a dozen nations that would normally expect to receive U.S. aid this year will now get nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kenya, where government officials have been expressing concern about the future of Western aid funds, Nairobi's Daily Nation news-paper quoted U.S. Ambassador</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith Hempstone as saying that Washington's interest in Eastern Europe will deplete the resources previously allocated to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see the source is still the same,&quot; Hempstone told the paper, &quot;but the recipients are increasing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other U.S. officials say Africa probably will not be caught in that squeeze, and certainly not this year. One of the reasons is that a significant chunk of assistance to Africa comes from the Development Fund for Africa (DFA) -- a portion of worldwide development aid that Congress set aside for Africa for 1988 and has continued to fund. The DFA designates a pot of funds -- separate from other aid monies -- to programs that deliver development assistance to Africa, so that they can be more flexible and responsive to Africa's special needs. Projected DFA funds for this year are approximately $ 569 million. &quot;There is a conscience-driven momentum for keeping at least that level of assistance going for Africa,&quot; says one State Department economics officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the official concedes, there are &quot;natural and psychological to say nothing of strategic reasons&quot; for guessing that African aid won't rise. &quot;The Africans have been getting a fair piece of money for a long time, and only recently have a lot of them been trying to use it in ways that we would think were good,&quot; the official says. &quot;The Eastern Europeans haven't had the chance, haven't fed at this particular trough -- either the World Bank, the U.S. or the Japanese trough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans see things differently. For some time now, many African economic planners have been arguing that their countries have been making the painful economic adjustments that international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have advocated. African nations have been moving towards more open economies and away from government ownership and central control. In addition, some are, even in the midst of the economic dislocations that accompany the reforms, moving towards more participatory political systems. Yet, they say, Western governments have fallen short of the commitments they made to support these difficult processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Africans see similar reforms in Eastern Europe generating broad enthusiasm and immediate financial backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's natural, says the State Department official. &quot;In our case, cultural and historic links are much closer to Europe than they are to anywhere else. A lot more Polish-Americans live in the United States than, say, Malian-Americans. And that does make a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference a domestic lobby makes can clearly be seen in the case of Israel, which, with a population of only four million, gets $ 3 billion this year. One North African country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">does benefit from the Israeli constituency though; Egypt, whose aid from the U.S. is tied to Israel's by a formula agreed upon in the Camp David accords, is getting around $ 2.1 billion in 1989 -- twice the amount going to all of sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bertram Collins says that there is an emerging consensus between African countries and international donors about the way ahead for Africa. Despite some continuing differences on strategies, Africans accept the need for far-reaching reforms -- and donors have recognized the danger of quick fixes that focus only on balanced budgets. Collins points to a major World Bank report released late last year (see Africa News, Dec. 25, 1989) as an important document &quot;that admits to certain errors and failures in the past.&quot; It calls for increased support for far-sighted programs in such areas as health care and education which have been hardest hit by economic adjustment. &quot;That would have been front page news at another time,&quot; says Collins. But developments in the Soviet Union and its allies have pushed Africa out of the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am concerned that Africa might become increasingly marginalized,&quot; Collins says, &quot;and that the good will that exists and the clear vision which is now becoming more and more evident will not bring about the results we all want.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is part of a year-long research project on the secrets of Zairean state finances. The investigation was begun by Africa News contributor Steve Askin, with follow up by Reed Kramer. An earlier report (Africa News, June 12, 1989) documented the disappearance of funds from the Zaire treasury and apparent diversions of export revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Askin's writings for the Christian Science Monitor and Business Week were the first to explore the role of a senior member of Congress, Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-CA), in promoting business opportunities in Africa for his associates. Further articles probing Dymally's activities have appeared in recent months in Legal Times, the Journal of Commerce, the Los Angeles Times, and the Washington Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Askin's forthcoming book on Zaire under Mobutu explores more more fully the complex web of financial connections between the Zaire government and a number of leading Americans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only extensive recent interview with President Mobutu Sese Seko to appear in the U.S. media was published by Africa News on March 7, 1988. The interview was conducted by Dr. Jeffrey Elliot, a political science professor from North Carolina Central University and Rep. Mervyn Dymally, on his first visit to Zaire. Elliot and Dymally had previously collaborated on an interview with Fidel Castro for Playboy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa News received the full transcript of a several-hour question and answer session with Mobutu, which we edited to be one of a four-part series on Zaire. Elliot and Dymally were paid at our standard per-word rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its April and May, 1988 issues, the French monthly Jeane Afrique Magazine reprinted the interview from Africa News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month, the full text, as well as Elliot/Dymally interviews with seven other Zaireans including two Mobutu opponents, will be released in book form, Voices of Zaire: Rhetoric or Reality, by the Washington Institute Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when Africa is actively courting American business, U.S.  firms have found their path to one of Africa's largest mining companies blocked by an unorthodox arrangement with a New Jersey food broker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire has granted a lucrative contract to a company controlled by one of his long-time American supporters, Grover Connell. Under the agreement, Connell Rice and Sugar Company holds exclusive rights to procure most of the equipment, spare parts and other items obtained in the U.S. by Gecamines, the government-owned mineral giant in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the handful of diplomats, bankers and corporate officials who have known about it, the Connell contract illustrates the extent to which U.S.  relations with Zaire revolve around a group of prominent Americans, whose ability to do business there is based on personal ties to Mobutu, and whose financial interests are closely intertwined with efforts to win friends and influence for Zaire and its leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although not a public figure, Grover Connell is a wealthy businessman with good political connections. On Capitol Hill, he is well-known for an unusual $ 84,000-a-year seminar program, under which members of Congress have been receiving honoraria for visiting Connell headquarters in Westfield, New Jersey.  According to data compiled by Common Cause, Connell Rice disbursed $ 2,000 each, the legal limit, to 39 House members and three Senators in 1988 and paid out the same amount in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program makes Connell the largest corporate donor of Congressional honoraria, a controversial channel for political contributions. (Under the pay-raise legislation adopted by the House of Representatives in December, members are now barred from accepting honoraria, but the Senate still permits the practice.) Only four large trade associations, led by the Tobacco Institute, gave more to members of Congress than Connell did in 1988, the last year for which figures are available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, four House members who have received Connell honoraria travelled with Grover Connell to Zaire, where his company handles the largest share of U.S. government food aid contracts under the Food for Peace program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire, a strategically-located central African nation bordering nine other countries, has one of the world's most impoverished populations and one of its most flamboyantly wealthy leaders. Since seizing control of the former Belgian Congo in a 1965 CIA-backed coup, Mobutu has held virtually absolute sovereignty. He also relies heavily on support from Western governments, particularly France and the U.S. -- and sometimes from Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler with whom relations have been stormy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Successive American administrations have backed Mobutu on the premise that he is the only leader capable of holding together the vast nation -- about the size of the U. S. east of the Mississippi River -- and a treasure house of minerals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mobutu's reputation for human rights abuses, lavish spending and corruption has tarnished his public image. &quot;Congress has restricted aid to Zaire partly because it is a plutocracy where resources are diverted from their assigned destinations and have historically been so,&quot; Rep. Howard Wolpe, chairman of the House Africa subcommittee said last year. &quot;We have seen, in this subcommittee, evidence that literally hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars have vanished into the hands or the bank accounts of the president and his collaborators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to diplomatic sources, Connell Rice and Sugar has been collecting a 30% commission on Gecamines purchases in the U.S. since the contract was signed in early 1988. The purchases normally average about $ 5 million a month, providing annual earnings for the Connell company of more than $ 15 million. These fees are &quot;far out of line with anything anyone else is charging,&quot; says one knowledgeable official. Although he expressed his willingness to talk with Africa News, Connell repeatedly failed to be available for an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was heavy resistance to the Connell contract at Gecamines, says the official. &quot;They had no desire to have this rice dealer charge them for something they had been doing for themselves,&quot; the official says. But Mobutu -- whose photograph appears on the frontispiece of the annual report -- effectively controls the company by appointing its top officials. And he apparently wanted the contract signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, where Zaire is seeking assistance to meet payments on its crippling $ 8 billion foreign debt, Connell's lock on procurement and his price tag have caused dismay. Gecamines is by far the country's largest business, producing copper and cobalt worth about $ 800 million to $1.3 billion a year (depending on market conditions) and providing up to three-quarters of Zaire's export earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of its vital role in contributing foreign exchange to Zaire's ailing economy, Gecamines is kept under close scrutiny by the international lending institutions, and irregularities have been uncovered throughout the mining company's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the contract with Connell is seen as &quot;perfectly legal,&quot; according to one knowledgeable official, there is concern that the high commissions are reducing revenues that are badly needed for Zaire's overdue loan payments and for budgetary outlays under an IMF economic stabilization program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following protests by Zaire's lenders and donors, Gecamines payments to Connell have been reduced, the official says. A number of Gecamines suppliers are now refusing to work through Connell and are making sales directly to the mining company, as they did before the contract was signed, industry sources report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the contract is regarded as part of a continuing pattern under which Zaire's budget and its mining revenues serve as a &quot;private pool of funds for Mobutu and his friends,&quot; in the words of one senior international economist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Frankly, I'm not sure what the hell is happening to that money,&quot; says a lending institution officer. But many officials are convinced the funds are somehow being rerouted to seek greater support for Zaire in Washington and around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For more than a quarter of a century, Mobutu has assiduously wooed America's leaders. He has been a frequent visitor to the White House since 1963, when, as head of the army but not yet head of state, he was received by John F. Kennedy. He has already managed three separate encounters with President George Bush -- more than any other African head of state -- twice at the White House last year and once at Emperor Hirohito's funeral in Tokyo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush is probably the closest friend Mobutu has had in the Oval Office.  By Mobutu's count, the two men have met 15 times since Bush first visited Kinshasa in 1972 while serving as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Bush has sailed on Mobutu's luxurious Zaire River yacht, and the Zaire president has been included in a congenial family dinner at the Bush retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu told interviewers last year that Bush came to &quot;know Zaire's problems by heart&quot; during his year as head of the CIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Democratic side, Mobutu's most important and longest-standing relationship has been with New York diamond magnate Maurice Tempelsman, a leading political fund-raiser who is also current chair of the African-American Institute. His business involvement in the country is as old as the Mobutu government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, Tempelsman has served as an important intermediary with both Democratic and Republican administrations and has negotiated business deals in Zaire worth hundreds of millions of dollars for American, South African and Japanese firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, the Zaire leader has developed ties with several members of the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly the immediate past chair, Mervyn Dymally of California. In 1988, at Dymally's request, Mobutu contributed $ 250,000 to a California charity, Coalition for a Free Africa (CFA), founded by Dick Griffey, a friend and campaign contributor to both Dymally and former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu has also made extensive use of paid lobbyists to plead his case in Washington. Currently, Zaire employs two firms. One of them, van Kloberg and Associates, headed by Edward J. van Kloberg, III, has a history of representing controversial governments, among them Zaire's closest East European ally, Romania. Zaire's other contract is with Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly, a public relations company with high-level Republican ties which also represents the Unita rebel movement of Angola, headed by Jonas Savimbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Zaire's earlier Washington representatives were drawn from the world of the fabulously wealthy. In the mid-1980s, they included Nael el-Assad, a relative of Saudi Arabian arms merchant Adnan Khashoggi, once one of the richest non-head-of-states in the world; and Robert Maheu, the ex-FBI man who helped the CIA recruit a Mafia hitman to try to kill Fidel Castro and in the 1970s served as chief assistant to that decade's richest American, the late Howard Hughes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Altogether, Zaire has spent over $ 3 million in the past five years seeking to influence American policy. But the debate in Washington has shifted very little. Each administration has continued supporting Mobutu, seeing him as the only viable option for pro-tecting the interests of Zaire, while his critics in Congress have fought to restrict and reduce foreign aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest and most serious challenge to the Zaire leader on Capitol Hill is the near-total aid cutoff -- on grounds of &quot;uncontrollable corruption&quot; -- proposed by Rep. Ronald Dellums (D-CA), who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus. When he first introduced the legislation in 1988, Dellums received the backing of most of his Caucus colleagues and many other members as well. But Mobutu has made inroads into that support by aggressively reaching out to the Caucus membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the center of the effort has been Mamadi Diane, a Guinean-born businessman who heads a shipping brokerage firm, Amex International, which is the agent for U.S. government food aid shipments to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diane and Connell have business connections dating back to the mid-1970s, when Diane worked for the St. John International Company. Connell was part owner of an affiliate company, St. John Maritime, which was implicated in the Tongsun Park Koreagate rice-buying scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Park, a U.S.-educated Korean businessman, gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to members of Congress, both to boost support for South Korea's military dictatorship and to win Food for Peace contracts for his business associates. He was convicted of making bribes, but charges against Connell were dismissed in 1979, after Park withdrew his allegations that Connell knew about the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, all three men have close ties to Mobutu, as well as overlapping African involvements. Diane serves as shipping agent for Food for Peace consignments to Zaire, while Connell Rice supplies much of the food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Park's precise relationship with Mobutu remains a mystery, but he appears to be playing both a political and a business role. When Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana, the ranking Republican on the House Africa subcommittee, stopped off in Zaire after visiting Savimbi in Angola last year, he says he was surprised to encounter Park at Gbadolite, Mobutu's presidential palace. Last June, according to columnist Jack Anderson, Park was present when Paul Manafort met with Mobutu to secure the lobbying contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Connell and Diane have been active in promoting Congressional visits to Zaire. The four members of the House who accompanied Connell there this month include two liberal Democrats from his state, Robert Torricelli and Robert Mrazek, as well as Mike Espy, a black Democrat from Mississippi, and Bill Lowery, a Republican from California. Torricelli has received $ 6,000 in honoraria from Connell over three years, Lowery $ 4,000 and Mrazek and Espy $ 2,000 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, Mrazek authored a letter to Mobutu, co-signed by 47 other House members, which expressed disquiet about &quot;persistent reports of widespread government corruption and human rights abuses.&quot; Torricelli and Espy were among the co-signers. Mrazek says he is still concerned about political freedoms in Zaire, but he is hopeful of a &quot;more forthcoming attitude on the part of the Zairean government with respect to human rights.&quot; Mrazek says his airfare was paid out of Congressional travel funds; while in Zaire the four Congressmen were guests of the Zaire government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diane has organized trips to Zaire for Dymally and other black members of Congress, and he has actively lobbied Zaire's cause on Capitol Hill. In 1988, he established the Zaire American Research Institute (ZARI) in Washington, D.C. to &quot;promote friendship, cooperation, and improved relations&quot; and to engage in research and disseminate information, according to incorporation papers filed with the District of Columbia government. The organization's 1988 tax records indicate that initial funding of $ 100,000 was used to open an office on K Street and hire an executive director, Marva Jo Camp, who had been an aide to Dymally. Last year, Camp was replaced by Glenwood Roane, an attorney who has been director in three African countries for the U.S. Agency for International Development, AID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding for the institute has come from Zaire businessmen, Roane said in an interview. The largest contributor has been Bemba Saolona, chairman of Zaire's principal business organization. Bemba is widely regarded as one of Mobutu's closest advisors and business associates.  He owns a string of manufacturing, agricultural and distribution companies, as well as SCIBE, the country's second largest airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roane says Bemba contributed about $ 90,000 to ZARI in 1989 -- out of a total budget of some $ 220,000. Another $12,000 was given by the General Motors subsidiary in Zaire, GMAZ. In addition, Bemba provided air transport for a group of black mayors who were taken to Zaire by ZARI in June. In May, ZARI received an $ 80,000 transfer from the Swiss Bank account of Idrissa Toure, a Guinean believed to be associated with Diane in several business ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the coming year, Roane says, ZARI will concentrate on helping Zaire formulate a &quot;responsible policy&quot; for handling its immense rain forest.  &quot;President Mobutu is fully aware of the importance of that resource,&quot; Roane says, &quot;and we want to move quickly to assist efforts to preserve it.&quot; Whether Zaire can obtain a reduction of its debt by promising to preserve its forests, in the sort of &quot;debt-for-nature&quot; exchange that international lending agencies have been discussing with Brazil, is undetermined. But ZARI hopes to coordinate an international conference to examine all aspects of the rain forest question to be held in Zaire late this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While ZARI and Diane have concentrated on the Black Caucus, van Kloberg has focussed on improving Zaire's image among other members of Congress and in the news media. Working under a two-year, $ 300,000 agreement, the firm made most of the arrangements for Mobutu's official trip to Washington last July, which included not only an Oval Office visit but also meetings on Capitol Hill and a session with reporters at Blair House. Van Kloberg also handled a follow-up trip by the vice prime minister, Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi, whom Mobutu has put in charge of &quot;citizen's rights and liberties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, the firm has put together two issues of a newsletter, Zaire News and plans to establish a Zaire-American friendship committee, composed of prominent figures from both countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his June visit, Mobutu beefed up the PR effort. He signed a one year, $ 1 million contract with Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly immediately following his departure from the U.S., where he reportedly wasangered by criticisms of his government in news reports and from members of Congress. The Black Manafort firm has managed three successful visits for Jonas Savimbi, whose warm welcome here is something that has eluded Mobutu. Charles Black and Paul Manafort, the firms' principals, played leading</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">roles in the Bush presidential campaign of 1988, alongside their former partner, Lee Atwater, the Bush campaign manager and current chair of the Republican National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the forefront of the campaign against Mobutu over the past two years has been the Rainbow Lobby, a Washington, D.C.-based group affiliated with the New Alliance Party but unconnected to Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. The Rainbow Lobby has actively promoted the Dellums Bill and has forged links with leading Zaire opposition figures. The group has attacked Dymally for his Zaire-related activities, and Dymally has responded in kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Glenwood Roane of ZARI sued the Lobby for defamation in connection with remarks made by Howard University professor Nzongola Ntalaja at a Rainbow Lobby-sponsored seminar. But Roane has recently dropped the suit. In another counter-attack, a forthcoming article in the magazine American Spectator by David Brock, who is highly critical of Mobutu's Congressional adversaries, alleges that the Lobby &quot;set up&quot; Rep. Gus Savage (D-IL) to keep him from joining the Black Caucus defections from the Dellums bill. Savage has been accused by a Peace Corps volunteer of sexually molesting her during a visit Savage made to Zaire with Diane last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Kloberg has led the campaign against the Rainbow Lobby and is credited with achieving results on Capitol Hill for his controversial client.  Black Manafort's role, on the other hand, remains fuzzy. &quot;We never see them at all,&quot; says one administration aide. As with the Connell contract with Gecamines, insiders are asking what the firm is doing to earn its high fee.  Black Manafort officials won't comment on their activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dymally's role in obtaining gifts and contracts in Africa for political associates has provoked questions about possible conflicts of interest, including a complaint to the House Ethics Committee from the U.S.- Congo Friendship Committee, a Rainbow Lobby ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, the Journal of Commerce reported that Dymally had written to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, protesting his govern-ment's decision to hire as its agents for food aid shipments &quot;a firm other than Amex International,&quot; Diane's company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dymally has also intervened with the Angolan government to obtain oil shipping contracts for Dick Griffey, who owns Solar Records and the African Development Public Interest Corporation (ADPIC), a Hollywood trading company.  Griffey says during one trip to Luanda, Dymally introduced him to Angolan officials and said &quot;the best way&quot; for the government to resolve its problems with the United States is &quot;to make contact with the African-American community&quot; and &quot;to find a black American and do business with him.&quot; Angola has been seeking to convince Washington to end its support for the Unita insurgency and normalize diplomatic relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another occasion, the Washington Post has reported, Dymally used a meeting in Washington with Angolan oil minister Pedro de Castro Van-Dunem Loy to ask that Luanda expedite processing of a $ 12 million shipment already agreedto for Griffey's ADPIC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988, Griffey's Coalition for a Free Africa paid part of the expenses for part of an African tour which took him to seven nations, and later to Brazil. During his travels, Dymally says he sought to raise additional funding for CFA. So far, the only sizeable donation the coalition has received beyond Mobutu's $ 250,000 is some $300,000 contributed by Griffey, according to Virgil Roberts, Griffey's general counsel and president of ADPIC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dymally also sought an oil contract in Angola for Camp, the former ZARI executive director and part-time Dymally aide. He made the request in a letter to Angola's ambassador in New York Manuel Pacavira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Griffey and Dymally adamently dispute charges that they are involved in conflicts of interest or profiteering at Africa's expense. Dymally insists that his efforts are a legitimate and important part of his role as a black political leader. &quot;I see nothing wrong with helping black businessmen get contracts in Zaire or anywhere else,&quot; Dymally said in an interview.  Criticism of him for these actions &quot;is all racism,&quot; he says. White Americans and Europeans have a corner on most business opportunities in Africa,&quot; he charges, &quot;and they don't want to share them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffey says he is not getting involved in Africa to make money. The $ 250,000 Mobutu contribution to CFA had &quot;nothing to do,&quot; Griffey says, with hisbusiness activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to do something that helps the people,&quot; he says. &quot;I see Africa as the new frontier, the world's richest continent, the world's poorest people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Researchers from the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) have formally announced the development of a drug which they say eliminated most of the symptoms of AIDS during clinical trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the drug's apparent success first was made public in December, when Kemri celebrated its tenth anniversary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although some local press reports hailed the trials as a breakthrough, with headlines suggesting that a cure for AIDS had been found, the magazine Weekly Review criticized Kemri for announcing the drug before publishing the research in a scientific journal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An announcement without professional or academic publishing has little or no standing in scientific circles,&quot; wrote Weekly Review editor Hilary Ng'weno.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, in a cover story on the drug, called KEO89, the magazine said the new treatment shows genuine promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference in Nairobi last Tuesday, Kemri director Dr.  David Keoch stressed that the interferon-based drug offers no cure for AIDS.  But he said trials on more than 100 patients at Kenyatta National Hospital had reversed most symptoms within weeks after therapy began, without serious side affects. The only drug currently recognized as an effective AIDS treatment, AZT, shows results only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after being taken for longer periods and its side effects are severe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keoch said the clinical results of KEO89, which is being developed in collaboration with Texas and Japanese-based laboratories, will soon be published.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time in recent months that Kenyan scientists have shared results of potentially important research. Late last year the International Center for Insect Parasitology and Ecology, located just outside Nairobi, was able to demonstrate that its inexpensive insect traps could virtually eliminate the destructive tsetse fly from test tracts of infested land.</SPAN></P>

The decisions to unban the African National Congress (ANC) and other opposition groups, suspend the death penalty, lift restrictions on political activists and the media, and release Nelson Mandela have required a re-evaluation of both tactics and strategy by all sides.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* lifting all bans and restrictions on organizations and persons;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* removing all troops from the townships;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* ending the state of emergency and repealing all legislation, including the Internal Security Act, designed to circumscribe political activity; and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* ceasing all political trials and political executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar preconditions are detailed in the U.S. Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 (for a summary, see Africa News, August 1989).  Congress determined that the sanctions against South Africa imposed by the Act would automatically expire if the South African government agrees to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* free Nelson Mandela and &quot;all persons persecuted for their political beliefs or detained unduly without trial;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* repeal the state of emergency and release all detainees;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* legalize &quot;democratic political parties;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* repeal the Groups Areas Act and the Population Registration Act; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* enter into &quot;good faith negotiations with truly representative members of the black majority without preconditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president also is empowered to lift or modify the sanctions, after giving Congress 30 days notice to disapprove. The South African government must take the first step outlined above, along with three of the other stipulations, and make &quot;substantial progress towards dismantling the system of apartheid and establishing a non-racial democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A comparison of these two sets of criteria with the decisions outlined in de Klerk's speech, indicates that the South African government has now agreed to much -- but not all -- of what has been demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Commission in South Africa says only about 25% of the approximately 2,500 convicted political prisoners now jailed will be released by de Klerk's announcement that Nelson Mandela, and all other persons imprisoned for belonging to previously-proscribed organizations, will be freed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the State of Emergency remains in place, de Klerk removed various regulations restricting education and the media, while retaining the ban on television coverage of unrest. In a statement last week, the Washington, D.C.-based Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said that even if &quot;these draconian provisions of the State of Emergency regulations are repealed, the South African government retains all of those powers and more under the permanent legislation, the Internal Security Act, which remains unaffected by President de Klerk's announced reforms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the toleration of dissent, in addition to unbanning the ANC, the government legalized the Pan Africanist Congress and the South African Communist Party, which was outlawed in 1950. Restrictions were also lifted on another 33 anti-apartheid groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk has taken no action to pull soldiers and police from black townships, nor has he asked parliament to repeal the Group Areas Act or the Population Registration Act. The ANC, however, has not made abolition of racially exclusive legislation a pre-condition for talks, leaving this for negotiation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he did not abolish political executions, as the Harare declaration asked, de Klerk went further than most observers expected by completely suspending executions, pending an inquiry into the issue of death sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government opponents, including the ANC, have called de Klerk's speech an important first step towards creating a &quot;climate for negotiations.&quot; Although wide gaps still di-vide the two sides, both appear to be groping towards a common ground that would enable talks about South Africa's future to begin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare, Zimbabwe -- Former South African policeman Dirk Coetzee buries his head in his hands during a conversation about his role in death squad activities. Asked how he would feel if he came face to face with two children whose father he had murdered in 1981, Coetzee, who once commanded a police counter-insurgency unit, visibly fights to contain his emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coetzee has admitted that he participated in killing human rights lawyer Griffiths Mxenge, who was a prominent defender of political prisoners, including members of the African National Congress (ANC). Coetzee says he acted under orders fromtop police officials, who told him to make the murder appear to be part of a robbery attempt. Mxenge was hacked to death and his skull bashed in by African policemen under Coetzee's command. Three years later, Mxenge's widow Victoria, also a lawyer, was assassinated in front of her Durban home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't face the Mxenge children right now, nor any of the women I made widows,&quot; says Dirk Coetzee, struggling both with English and with remorse. &quot;Maybe some years from now, after I have testified to everyone I can and exposed my superiors, maybe then they will be able to forgive me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coetzee says he was a senior member of a counter-insurgency unit operating from a farm outside Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.  He describes a number of similar units that functioned as death squads to kill hundreds of anti-apartheid activists inside South Africa, in neighboring countries and in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social anthropologist David Webster was the leading researcher into political assassinations until he himself was assassinated last year. Shortly before being gunned down outside his Johannesburg home, Webster wrote that at least 121 anti-apartheid campaigners -- 60 in South Africa and 61 in exile -- had been killed since 1978. Those numbers were given credibility late last year, when another former member of a police anti-terrorist unit, Butana Almond Nofomela, detailed his involvements in numerous killings of suspected or known activists. Nofomela named former Captain Dirk Coetzee as the field commander of his assassination squad (see Africa News, December 4, 1989).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the Nofomela allegations, Coetzee fled, first to the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius -- where he told his story to a reporter for the anti-apartheid Afrikaans-language newspaper Vrye Weekblad -- and then to London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I realized it was all over,&quot; says Coetzee. &quot;I knew I would be charged, I knew my superiors would duck and dive and dump me, and I knew if I told the truth in South Africa they would get me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Coetzee interview was published in November, South African human rights groups pushed for an independent investigation into the charges of both Coetzee and Nofomela. Government officials initially said that police investigators could handle the job. But on January 31, South African Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said President de Klerk had decided to appoint an independent judicial Commission of Inquiry into the allegations. In response, the Campaign for a Judicial Inquiry Into Hit Squads canceled a protest march scheduled for February 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dirk Coetzee says now that it was the ANC underground inside South Africa, with which he was able to make contact, who helped arrange his escape from the country. When he got to London, he says, he was questioned at length by Jacob Xuma, a member of the National Executive Committee, the ANC's policy-making body. &quot;I spilled my guts out,&quot; Coetzee says. &quot;I told him if he didn't believe my story, I would need help for four months to get on my feet, get a job, so my wife and two children could join me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ANC did believe him. The details he gave of his activities coincided with growing revelations from other former policemen and from the ANC's own intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three days of conversations in London, Xuma and Coetzee flew to Zimbabwe. Here he has spent his time telling ANC officials about the inner workings of the death squads, implicating scores of men he says are still in the police force, as well as a former Minister of Police, Louis le Grange, now speaker of South Africa's parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with no ANC members present, Coetzee says he underwent a transformation in the weeks he has been closeted with ANC intelligence operatives. &quot;I discovered the South African government had lied to me all my life,&quot; he says. &quot;They told me the ANC were communist terrorists who wanted to push whites into the sea. I hunted them down, I murdered without any conscience. I felt I was justified that I was saving South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coetzee says that Jacob Xuma and the other ANC members he has met have convinced him that he himself was a victim of apartheid. &quot;Last September,&quot; he says, &quot;I voted for the &cent;far-right/ Conservative Party. Now I am with the ANC.  That's because I learned the truth. I will serve the ANC in whatever way they decide for the rest of my life.&quot; He says he would like other policemen, especially those who are black, to understand that they are &quot;just cannon fodder&quot; who will be dumped when the going gets tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers from South Africa are expected to visit Coetzee at the ANC's exile headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, to take evidence for the Commission of Inquiry. Coetzee says he would also like an opportunity to share his experiences in Europe and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cynical but common view of Coetzee is that he has cleverly saved his life by defecting to the ANC. But those who have heard Coetzee apologize to families of his victims in an anguish-strangled voice find it easy to believe his sincerity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&cent;Police officials in South Africa argue that Coetzee was a renegade who had already left the force under a cloud, after a 1983 departmental hearing into various criminal activities, such as drug dealing and pornography, within police ranks. Some have suggested that his fervent embrace of the ANC, like his previous &quot;true believer&quot; work in death squads, may be a sign of a mental instability caused by diabetes, which was the formal reason for his premature retirement from the police./</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever Coetzee's original motivation or current state of mind, many of his charges are expected to receive further support. The ANC says that within weeks it will hold a press conference to present about a dozen of Coetzee's death squad colleagues whose names have not yet been released, in addition to two former secret policemen, Heine Human and Martin Dolincheck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human, a Swede who left South Africa in December, reportedly has told the ANC that he was involved in arrangements to assassinate the organization's representative in France, Dulcie September, who was killed in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolincheck had been sentenced to death in the Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles, after a South African-sponsored mercenary group failed in a 1981 attempt to overthrow the government of President Albert Rena. He was reprieved and allowed to return to South Africa a year later, but defected to the ANC in 1986.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With starvation threatening as many as ten million people in the Horn of Africa, pressure is growing on the military regimes in both Ethiopia and Sudan to allow relief shipments to reach needy populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the immediate focus is on the creation of safe zones of passage for relief supplies in the war-ravaged regions of the two countries.  Last month, Senators Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA) and Alan K. Simpson (R-WY) issued a joint appeal for the opening of &quot;mercy corridors&quot; for the delivery of food to stricken areas under the auspices of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar has also called upon the Ethiopian government and two rebel movements to allow distribution of food to needy civilians, and various church agencies have made similar requests. The UN has been trying to launch Operation Lifeline II in Sudan, modeled on a largely-successful campaign in 1989, to get provisions into strife-torn areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, John Prendergast, a coordinator of the church-related Coalition for Peace in the Horn of Africa in Washington, D.C., says the &quot;endless negotiations&quot; over safe passage of relief supplies are &quot;ill-fated.&quot; During the 1984 famine, he argues, much effort was wasted on attempts to se-cure these transit agreements, when more accessible channels existed for bringing in supplies from neighboring states. The pattern is being repeated in the current crisis, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cross-border shipments are usually fraught with political complications, which is why the international community has sought to obtain the cooperation of the Ethiopian and Sudanese authorities. But in both countries, with insurgents gaining ground in the fighting, the regimes have refused to allow relief shipments into the areas of the heaviest conflict -- where the need for food is usually the greatest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, a seven-person delegation from American humanitarian agencies returned with grim news from Eritrea, Ethiopia's northern-most province where the guerrilla movement fighting for independence has the upper hand over the Ethiopian army in large areas of the territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eritrea has run out of food,&quot; says one delegate from InterAction, the 120-member coordinating council for U.S. relief groups. &quot;Farmers are selling their goats, their livelihood,&quot; she adds, &quot;because there is no grass for them to eat.&quot; Although the Ethiopian government agreed last month to allow church agencies to deliver food into certain rebel-held areas, and over 90 metric tons of food aid have been donated by the international community for Eritrea, relief is &quot;just starting to trickle in,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Altogether, one million people are believed to be facing starvation in Eritrea. An additional three million are said to be at risk in Tigray, south of Eritrea, where another insurgent movement has taken control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sudan, fighting between government forces and the Sudanese Peoples' Liberation Army (SPLA) in the south has been heavy in recent weeks. Relief workers were forced to evacuate Juba, the largest town in the south, after the SPLA took up positions on the outskirts of the city and began shelling in what some observers believe was an effort to close the airport and severely limit supply access to the region. Thousands of civilians fled into the northern regions and into Uganda and Zaire in search of food and safety.  Although the shelling appeared to stop last week, residents face immediate and severe food shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, current head of the Organization of African Unity, began another mediation effort last week, hosting talks in Cairo between the Sudanese government and the SPLA.  Discussions involving the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean Liberation Front -- one of several rebel groups operating out of Eritrea -- were reportedly planned for Sanaa, the Yemeni capital. But the prospects for success in any of these efforts appear poor, following the unsuccessful attempt at mediation of both conflicts by former President Jimmy Carter last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennedy and Simpson, who serve as chair and ranking minority members of the Senate subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, have said that heightened international pressure may be required to get the two governments' agreements on safe passage arrangements. The United Nations Security Council stated that they should be convened to debate the issue if the two regimes refuse to allow food deliveries to non-combatants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Prendergast says the level of pressure should be even greater. He calls for a cut off in all bilateral and multilateral forms of aid and trade with the Ethiopian and Sudanese governments and for a vigorous effort to &quot;make food, medicine, seeds, and tools available, no matter where the victims of conflict reside.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What is your reaction to what President de Klerk has done?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen: We welcome the announcement of the legalization of organizations and the impending release of political prisoners because we think it is a giant leap toward the normalization of political life. As long as the anti-apartheid groups can organize and communicate with the masses and develop negotiating strategies we think it's a good basis for beginning the negotiating scenario. But it is only the beginning, it doesn't solve the problem of apartheid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: How does the current approach of the South African government differ from what you have seen before?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen: Pre-de Klerk, you had what I call the policy of co-option. Now you have a desire to negotiate and compromise and bargain for a new constitution. That is what has turned the situation around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What do you want to see happen now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen: I would hope that within the next few months you will see the release of all the political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, preliminary discussions about how to negotiate a new constitution, and -- hopefully before the end of the year -- the beginning of a full-fledged negotiation on rewriting a consti-tution to bring about a democratic, non-racial, representative society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What about the ANC's concern about amnesty for its exiled members?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen: This should be resolved in what I call &quot;talks about talks.&quot; Before you can get into a real negotiating situation you have to develop a framework, so the question is, who is a political prisoner and who is not? And who abroad should be allowed to come back and who would be subject to prosecution? All this should be discussed between the two sides. And I hope that when Nelson Mandela is released he could play a major role in that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Has de Klerk taken the steps required for negotiations to begin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen: We have always agreed with the mass democratic movement that before you can negotiate you have to set up the right climate. And we think a lot of the climate has been created already. There are still a few steps to be taken -- principally the lifting of the state of emergency -- but I am hopeful that they will be taken within the next few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: The Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act sets out five requirements for terminating the U.S. sanctions (see page 10). Is it premature to talk about lifting them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen: It is not premature. At such a time as four out of five of the requirements of the anti-apartheid act have been fulfilled, we will consult with Congress to discuss the suspension or modification of sanctions as called for by the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: But doesn't the legislation require government to first enter into &quot;good faith&quot; negotiations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen: It says the government must &quot;agree to enter into good faith negotiations.&quot; And I believe that in his speech F.W. de Klerk effectively agreed to enter into good faith negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Are you saying he has satisfied the conditions of the law?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen: No, there are two discriminatory laws that must be repealed.  There is also a requirement that the government &quot;has made substantial progress&quot; toward dismantling apartheid, which is a very subjective requirement that could be debated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What role do you see for the U.S.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen: We are clearly not mediators or facilitators, but since we do have a sanctions program we feel we do have influence. Our policy is to encourage both sides to negotiate in good faith and to criticize either or both sides if they show signs of not negotiating in good faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Are you saying U.S. leverage is a result of the sanctions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen: I think we always had leverage because there was always the threat of sanctions. We also have international political and diplomatic strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Why did President Bush invite both de Klerk and Mandela to Washington?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen: The purpose is to encourage a political settlement by talking to them and giving our point of view. The invitation itself is a recognition of what they have been doing in recent months, which we consider to be positive on both sides.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC-- Until Africans &quot;get into step with the rest of the world&quot; and move away from one-party rule, &quot;they will find it difficult to maintain the attention of the international community,&quot; says Herman J. Cohen, the assistant secretary of State for African Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviewed in his sixth floor office last week after one year as the Bush administration's top Africa policymaker, Cohen called upon African governments to &quot;seriously think&quot; about the implications of the democratic wave now sweeping such areas as eastern Europe. &quot;The single party state may no longer be accepted in the world as inherently democratic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interview, which touched on a broad range of topics and countries:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cohen called South African President F.W. de Klerk's February 2 speech legalizing black opposition parties a &quot;giant leap,&quot; but said &quot;it doesn't end apartheid.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* He condemned the Angolan government's current military offensive against the Unita rebel movement and said U.S. support for Unita will be maintained at a &quot;necessary and sufficient&quot; level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* He said the U.S. is ready to offer military assistance to soon-to-be-independent Namibia for safeguarding its valuable offshore fishing areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* He denied that Africa &quot;is being discriminated against&quot; in the new administration foreign aid requests that give the continent a declining percentage of worldwide economic aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* He said that while the administration opposes U.S. right-wing support for Renamo insurgents in Mozambique, &quot;we know of no American laws being broken by anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* He defended the administration for &quot;doing everything we can&quot; to prevent massive starvation and encourage an end to the conflicts in the Horn of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* He said indiscriminate killing of civilians in Liberia in reaction to an invasion in northeastern Nimba county has been halted, with the assistance of two American military advisors sent to the area to work with government soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen, who served as senior director for Africa on the National Security Council staff during the final 24 months of the Reagan presidency, has won generally good marks from African governments and Congress for his first year's performance. His predecessor, Chester Crocker, who held the same State Department post throughout the previous administration, had a rocky relationship with Congress. But Cohen assumed office with bipartisan backing on Capitol Hill and has managed to keep the confidence of key senators and House members of both parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he is also regarded here as less influential in shaping policy than was Crocker, who generally set the course of African issues for the Reagan administration. Cohen is not part of Secretary of State James Baker's inner circle of advisors, and at several critical junctures, Cohen has had to give way to his immediate superior, Under Secretary Robert Kimmett, a long-time Baker aide (see Africa News, November 1989).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa hands in Congress were disappointed when the new administration aid request arrived on Capital Hill last week with a smaller proportion of foreign aid for Africa than in any year since 1985. And some blamed the assistant secretary for not fighting for a larger share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aid budget asks $ 616 million for development assistance and economic support for Africa in fiscal year 1991 -- 10.9% of the worldwide total, compared with 11.1% this year and 13.95% in 1984. In the interview, Cohen denied that the request is a reflection of an &quot;anti-Africa attitude,&quot; calling it a result of &quot;our overall budget crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until reduced defense spending frees funds for foreign aid, the level of assistance for Africa is unlikely to increase, he said. And much depends on what steps Africa takes politically. &quot;As Africa demonstrates more commitment to economic reform and democracy,&quot; he said, &quot;I will advocate that we should reflect that in increasing aid levels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first year, Cohen has focussed heavily on events in southern Africa. Last month, he visited South Africa for discussions with President de Klerk, his senior ministers, and other politically-involved leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of de Klerk's actions this month, Cohen says he hopes to see &quot;full-fledged negotiations&quot; before the end of the year. With the release of Nelson Mandela, he said, the government will have taken sufficient steps to warrant consideration by Congress and the administration of the easing of American sanctions against South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 lists five actions the South African government must take to terminate the sanctions. It also offers the president the option of easing some of the restrictions if four of the five conditions are met. Cohen suggested that President George Bush may wish to exercise that option soon, if de Klerk follows through on his reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether Namibia, which is adopting a liberal democratic constitution, can expect to receive U.S. assistance, he said a &quot;modest&quot; program is planned for fiscal year 1991. But immediately upon independence next month, the new government will be offered the kind of military assistance program aimed at fisheries protection that has been tried successfully in several west African countries, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a stopover in Luanda last month on his way back from South Africa, Cohen encouraged the government of Angola to give up on &quot;trying to win on the battlefield.&quot; Until a process of national reconciliation takes place, he reiterated, U.S. aid for Unita will be maintained. In the interview, Cohen said the administration continues to back the mediation efforts of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has proposed an unconditional cease-fire and direct talks between the government and Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assistant secretary offered little prospect for any decisive U.S.  role in helping to resolve the conflicts in such places as Mozambique, Liberia, or the Horn of Africa. Asked if the American government might increase the pressure for peaceful solutions by calling greater attention to the troubles, he said &quot;there are only so many press releases we can make and so many messages we can send.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">735 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC -- Well-paid lobbyists and publicists are doing a booming business with African governments whose leaders are visiting the U.S. With the size of the contracts on the rise, competition for some of the most lucrative deals is intensifying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last fall, two lobbyists with long-standing White House ties won contracts to assist in arranging a trip by Congolese President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who is making the first State visit by an African leader to the Bush White House this week. Thad Garrett, a minority affairs aide to Bush when he was vice president, and Peter Hannaford, a former partner of Michael Deaver and top Reagan White House advisor, are said to be handling different aspects of the three-day stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garrett was also reported to be in the running for the contract to arrange Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida's visit, which was planned for January and then cancelled by the Nigerian leader. The Nigerians eventually took their business to other firms. Nigerian Ambassador Hamzat Ahmadu signed up van Kloberg and Associates for $ 70,000 to assist with arrangements. Edward van Kloberg, a former American University dean, represents Zaire and Cape Verde and has handled recent visits by the King of Lesotho and President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But two rival firms went to Lagos to make separate deals. The largest was a one-year, $ 1 million contract to &quot;provide professional services&quot; of a &quot;general nature,&quot;signed in December with Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly.  Known for its representation of the Angolan Unita rebel movement -- and for involvement in the ongoing scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban Development -- the firm had previously signed up another van Kloberg client, the government of Zaire, for a similar amount (see Africa News, January 29, 1990 and November 1989).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For additional trip preparations, Lagos engaged -- with an initial payment of over $ 40,000 -- the services of the Evans Group, composed of four former Republican Congressmen and a former Black Manafort employee, John Aycoth, who has filed suit against his former employer for breach of contract.  The four ex-House members include Mark Siljander, who served on the House Africa subcommittee after being elected in 1981 but lost a bid for re-election in 1986 after making an appeal to religious fundamentalists to &quot;break the back of Satan&quot; and support him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the money was never put to use. Nigerian President Babangida canceled following a major shake-up in the military command structure and the Armed Forces Ruling Council, which governs the country. According to West Africa magazine, Nigerian and foreign companies spent huge sums on other arrangements and publicity for the visit, including a 12-page color spread in the February issue of Ebony magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Manafort also assisted with the private visit this month of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi. The firm's contract with Kenya, signed last April, is a one year, $ 500,000 deal. Black Manafort handled media contacts during Moi's trip, including a press briefing by Foreign Minister Dr. Robert Ouko. Last year, Black Manafort managed publicity when the Kenyan government lit a bonfire of $ 3 million worth of ivory, publicizing its campaign for a worldwide ban on ivory trade to protect elephants, which are endangered by poaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' planned visit this month -- which, like Babangida's, was also cancelled -- Luanda engaged the services of the law firm of Laxalt, Washington, Perito and Dubuc, for a reported $ 800,000 a year. Soon after the representation became public, Paul Laxalt resigned from the firm. A conservative Republican from Utah, the former senator -- who chaired Ronald Reagan's presidential campaigns -- came under strong pressure from right-wing Unita backers over the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overlapping contracts signed by many African governments is evidence that lobbyists are considered essential when doing business with Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just how useful these often-expensive representations are for impoverished African governments remains unclear to many observers. One administration official involved in the visit argues that Sassou-Nguesso never required the costly help of a high-prestige lobbyist. The trip was already approved -- though not specifically scheduled -- before either of the contracts were signed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With his scheduled visit to the White House on Monday, Congolese President Denis Sassou-Nguesso became the first African leader to be accorded a State visit during the Bush administration. High on the U.S. agenda for the bilateral discussions is the intense fighting in Angola, Congo's southeastern neighbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the trip was announced only last week, it has been long in the planning, largely as an outcome of the key role Congo played in the U.S.-brokered 1988 negotiations which resulted in the Angolan and Namibian peace accords. &quot;It's a thank-you,&quot; one official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, before arriving in the U.S., the Congolese leader met with the presidents of Zaire and Gabon, Mobutu Sese Seko and Omar Bongo, in a renewed attempt to find a solution to the Angolan conflict.  Sassou-Nguesso, who has headed the central African nation since 1979, will be the third African president to visit Washington this month. Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Pierre Buyoya of Burundi attended the National Prayer Breakfast on February 1, where they talked with President George Bush. Scheduled visits last month by two other leaders -- General Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos -- were both canceled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a State visitor, the Congolese president is having an arrival ceremony on the White House grounds and a formal State dinner in the evening.  For an official visit, such as the one by Buyoya, the pomp is missing and meetings with top level officials are the only formalities on the schedule.  Moi came on a private visit, which does not require extensive pre-arrangements with U.S. officialdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Bush prepared to welcome Sassou-Nguesso, who enjoys generally good relations with the Angolan government in Luanda, the subject of Angola is again claiming the attention of U.S. policymakers. Fapla, the Angolan army, is engaged in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">major assault in the southwest corner of the country against the Unita rebel movement led by Jonas Savimbi, which is supported and armed by the U. S.  A fierce battle has been raging, with both sides last week claiming to hold the strategic town of Mavinga, only 20 miles from Unita headquarters at Jamba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Luanda announced that Fapla had captured Mavinga, the State Department issued a sharp condemnation of the government's &quot;futile offensive&quot; and called for negotiations to end the conflict. Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen visited Luanda on January 24 to press for a halt to the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day, Cuba announced a suspension in the withdrawal of its troops from Angola --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as agreed under the 1988 accords -- after a Unita attack on a southern Angolan village killed four Cubans and three Angolan soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Havana said it was the second time Cuban troops had been subjected to &quot;terrorist and criminal actions&quot; by Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuba, which has stayed ahead of the withdrawal timetable, having removed over half the 50,000 Cubans that were in Angola when the accords were signed, accused the U.S. of &quot;sabotaging&quot; the agreement by its continuing assistance to the rebel movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola's President dos Santos had planned to precede his Congolese counterpart to Washington. In response to an invitation from 34 members of the House of Representatives, dos Santos had been expected in the capital city on February 6, on a private visit arranged by TransAfrica, the African-American lobby. The trip was canceled after the Bush administration pressured dos Santos not to come, TransAfrica's Executive Director Randall Robinson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration officials say &quot;no obstacles&quot; were placed in the way of the trip. Rather, they say, Luanda's decision was based partly on advice from the Portuguese government. Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva met in Washington last month with senior U.S. officials, including President Bush, who reportedly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Angolan offensive. The Portuguese leader, who had hoped to persuade the Bush administration to improve relations with Luanda as a prelude to resumed negotiations, returned to Lisbon convinced that American backing for Unita remains firm, diplomatic sources report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dos Santos' visit was predicated in large measure on the premise that support for Savimbi is eroding in Congress, where the rebel leader has enjoyed broad bipartisan backing. But, the current fighting has prompted renewed expressions of support for Savimbi from his staunchest allies on Capitol Hill.  Although there has not been any broad mobilization of pro-Savimbi activity this year in either the Senate or the House, the current government offensive and Luanda's reported refusal to accept new terms for negotiations have hindered efforts to improve Angola's reputation among members of Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the peace talks advocated by Angola's neighbors, including the Congo, have been stymied by the level of mistrust dividing the Angolan parties. Savimbi, meanwhile, has sought to boost his backing in Europe. At the end of January, he began what was to be a five-nation tour with a four-day stop in Portugal, Angola's former colonial ruler. Although he met with both Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva and Portuguese President Mario Soares, Silva played down the significance of the encounter, saying he met the Unita leader in his capacity as a party leader, not as the head of government. After Lisbon, though, Savimbi cut short his trip and returned home because of the Mavinga fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush is expected to ask Sassou-Nguesso to persuade Angola to end the fighting and to begin talks with Unita. The Congolese leader, dos Santos, and six other African heads-of-state have scheduled to meet to discuss peace efforts, but the summit has been postponed at least three times since November.  Meanwhile, the fighting has steadily increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials believe the government is intent on handing Unita a major defeat. &quot;They have thrown everything they can into this,&quot; one analyst says, &quot;and they are pushing Unita to the limit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Congress, Unita's friends are pushing for an increase in covert American assistance for the rebel movement, which is believed to have risen to about $ 50 million this year. On February 1, six conservative Republicans asked Secretary of State James Baker to &quot;ensure that Unita is sufficiently supplied during this critical period.&quot; The letter was signed by Senators Malcolm Wallop, Connie Mack, Larry Pressler, Steve Syms, Gordan Humphrey and Jesse Helms.  &quot;Given deterioration of the situation from Unita's standpoint,&quot; they said, &quot;we must seriously question the adequacy of U.S. support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate letter, Minority Leader Robert Dole called on Baker to raise the Angolan issue during his February 8-9 meetings with Soviet leaders in Moscow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a task force on terrorism and unconventional warfare, set up by the conservative House Republican Research Committee, has been issuing regular briefings on the fighting. &quot;The actual situation in the field seems to be very grave for Unita,&quot; last week's report said. &quot;The ceaseless aerial and artillery bombardment, already among the heaviest in Angola's history, is continuously intensifying.&quot; A major</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government assault is still to be expected, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their letter, the six Senators refer to &quot;disturbing rumors&quot; that supplies have been &quot;either non-existent or intermittent&quot; since a CIA cargo plane crashed in November while ferrying weapons and other supplies to Jamba.  Sources with access to information on the classified operation say air flights were suspended for several weeks after the accident, which killed four Americans. &quot;A new plane had to be obtained, painted, and put into service,&quot; one official said, &quot;and that all took time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the flights were resumed by the first of this year, the sources say, and the frequency of the flights has increased in recent weeks. The CIA is sending in fuel, spare parts and ammunition for anti-tank and other heavy weapons, the sources report. Before the December 1988 peace accords, South Africa was supplying most of Unita's fuel, trucking it into Jamba from Namibia. Unita claims to be self-sufficient in food and to be capturing the small arms and ammunition it needs from government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last June -- at the time President Mobutu emerged as mediator after arranging a brief meeting and handshake between dos Santos and Savimbi during a 19-nation summit at his palace in Gbadolite -- Mobutu halted U.S. shipments to Unita through Zaire. But after a visit to Washington, Mobutu allowed the operation to resume, U.S. officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the fighting rages, the peace process remains mired in disagreements. Angola charges that Savimbi reneged on promises made at the July summit, including a pledge that Unita would negotiate within the framework of the country's current one-party constitution. Unita blames the Angolan government for rejecting Mobutu's subsequent plea to begin talks immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to break the impasse the Congolese, Zairean and Gabonese presidents, in their meeting in Kinshasa last Wednesday, reportedly considered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a new Angolan proposal. It is that discussion that Sassou-Nguesso was expected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to share with President Bush, in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hope of securing U.S. backing for a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">new round of diplomacy to end the fighting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like most Mozambican children, twelve-year-old Jorge once was surrounded by people who loved him: parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then one day the rebel group Renamo arrived at the village in Inhambane province where Jorge lived. The invaders were searching for porters to transport their supplies and for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> people to populate the rural areas under Renamo control and grow food for the soldiers. Jorge and his parents were force-marched to a Renamo base camp, but his baby brother was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The baby was baggage; he didn't suit Renamo's goals or purposes,&quot; says Neil Boothby bitterly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boothby is a Duke University psychologist just back from two years working with Mozambique's children of war. In the process of helping to set up treatment programs, Boothby and his colleagues conducted 210 in-depth interviews and compiled questionnaires from talks with over 1,200 children who had been kidnapped by Renamo. What they learned is staggering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the five million children living in the war-affected areas -- which is virtually all of Mozambique outside ten urban centers -- 75 out of every 100 will see people murdered, often in large numbers. Eighty-eight percent will witness people being tortured by Renamo. Seventy-three percent will witness women being raped. Over half -- 63% -- will be kidnapped and taken from their families and communities. Of those, three-quarters will be forced to be porters and laborers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most tragic stories come from the 28% of kidnap victims between the ages of five and 15 who are forced to participate directly in Renamo's tortures and killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jorge's story is sadly typical. His father was killed and his mother was turned over to a group of soldiers for their sexual satisfaction. He himself was &quot;adopted&quot; by a Renamo chief as a personal servant. He was beaten and eventually was forced to beat others. In all of these situations, he and other children in the camp were warned to show no emotion and were taught not to care. When he was 14, Jorge was made leader of a gang of youths who were sent to attack villages over the course of the next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally he was able to escape, and what he told the adults who have tried to help him cope with his memories has haunted Neil Boothby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have had two lives,&quot; Jorge said. &quot;My first life was with my mother and my father and my family. My second life began when Renamo took me to their base camp. I was reborn in that camp and am not the same as before. What I saw, what I did, those were the things that changed me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Jorge may be one of the lucky ones. Some children have been forced to kill or to participate in the torture of members of their own families. And many have responded with a numb withdrawal from human interaction. The first goal of therapy for such children is to provide a safe, loving environment. Only after the children feel secure, are they encouraged to communicate their experiences through socio-dramas, re-enactments and drawings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neil Boothby's acquaintance with Mozambican children began at an orphanage, where 42 &quot;very tough&quot; boys between the ages of six and 16 were lodged.  Mozambique has had limited experience with orphanges, because strong families and community networks have cared for homeless children.  But this war has not only overwhelmed the traditional systems; it has produced a breed of children who cannot be cared for in a conventional setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was scared to death,&quot; Boothby says.  The boys had made themselves knives and razor blade weapons, and they were totally suspicious of adults. It took two to three months of spending time with them before the team of psychologists, health workers and care givers could break through the protective walls the children had built around themselves. &quot;If there was anything healing about any-thing we did,&quot; says Boothby, &quot;it was being there and caring about these kids and providing consistency and love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the techniques for helping the children understand and cope with what happened to them have helped, Boothby says. But the key to the children's chances for a normal future, he believes, is the relationships that are formed between the children and the members of the Organization of Mozambican Women, the OMM, which has taken on the task of helping young war victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the orphanage, the OMM women who came daily and who stayed with the boys at night were themselves scared in the beginning. But they were able to work through their fears and become close to their young wards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Girls in Renamo's custody, although less likely to be forced to torture and kill, endure their own nightmares. &quot;It's virtually impossible not to be raped,&quot; says Boothby. &quot;It's virtually impossible not to have children you don't want.&quot; And often those children are killed or abandoned, he says, because they don't meet the needs of Renamo. Boothby hopes that treatment programs run by women experienced in dealing with rape victims can be established in Mozambique soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his two years in Mozambique, Boothby helped the Ministry of Health develop and coordinate programs for the thousands of children across the country who have been exposed to or have participated in Renamo's brutality.  The results, so far, have been glimmers of hope in an otherwise grim story.  Although the children are tormented, most of them, over a period of time, have become able to express both their experiences and their feelings. A prime concern of the adults who work with them is to help them understand that they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">may have had little choice, either in the things that happened to them or the things they were made to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're so vulnerable, so small in comparison to the people that are asking them to do this,&quot; Boothby says. &quot;It begins with fear. If they don't do it, they themselves will be killed. And afterwards they're so humiliated that rage takes over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therapists working with children who have been forced to commit atrocities believe that the fear and the rage eventually obliterate moral sensibility. The child loses both a sense of self and the link between self and the rest of humanity. Re-establishing those links is the final step in re- storing the kidnapped children to their lives in the Mozambican community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way you can re-enter that life is through forgiveness,&quot; says Neil Boothby. &quot;You have to be able to forgive yourself, but you also -- probably more importantly -- have to be forgiven by the community, often by the very people you have victimized.&quot; And that, the therapists found, is often a difficult relationship to negotiate. Much of the early work of the treatment teams was helping the Mozambique government develop amnesty protocols for the children, and working with communities, teachers, government officials, and other children to help all of them see the returnees as victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health is working to identify all displaced children, whether or not they were captured by Renamo. In all, some 200,000 children are thought to be separated from their families -- some because their parents were kidnapped or killed and others because they were lost in the confusion or aftermath of an attack. Using information from the children, Polaroid photos, voice recordings and simple circulars, researchers have been able -- in the last four to five months alone -- to reunite over 3,000 children with a family member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent effort in Sofala province, over 200 children were documented in a two-week period. Officials now hope that as many as 80% of the displaced children can be returned to a family or community unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the work is difficult, and like all efforts to alleviate the suffering of Mozambicans, it is dangerous. From 70-90% of the country cannot be traveled safely. And it is the social service systems -- schools, churches, day care centers and clinics -- that are Renamo's prime targets. Many, if not most, of the children who are returned to their families risk being kidnapped again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those tactics have bemused anyone who has seen their effects.  &quot;It is beyond my ability to imagine,&quot; says Boothby, who has also worked with children from other war-wracked countries, including Cam-bodia under the Khmer Rouge.  &quot;The only thing I can come up with is that for Renamo, people are basically abstractions.  They have a political agenda, and everything is oriented towards accomplishing that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just what that agenda is, and who the shadowy figures behind it are, has eluded most observers. The Mozambique government has expressed its willingness to negotiate with anyone who can control what it calls the Renamo &quot;bandits.&quot; It authorized Mozambican churches to hold secret talks with Renamo representatives, and it has backed an attempt by Kenya's President Daniel Arap Moi and Zimbabwe Prime Minister Robert Mugabe to arrange direct talks between the government and the rebels.  So far, nothing has come of those efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Living in Mozambique has left Neil Boothby with his own anger. As a clinician, he says, his focus was on the children with whom he was working and what he could do to help them. Back in the U.S., he has begun to think about the meaning of his experiences. &quot;OK,&quot; he says. &quot;You've heard hundreds of children tell you their stories, you've listened to that. What does it mean? What does it mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What it means, he has concluded, is that Renamo -- a group founded by the intelligence services of the former white government of what is now Zimbabwe, and maintained by South Africa after Zimbabwe's independence -- is now supported by money and supplies from West Germany, Portugal, the U.S., Australia and South Africa. Relief workers, he says, constantly see signs of that support, which is believed to come through an international network of right-wing political and religious groups. (see Africa News, November 1989).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've personally arrived in at least half a dozen &cent;places/,&quot; Boothby says, &quot;and seen evidence of various &cent;U.S.-based/ churches involved with Renamo. It's something that makes me very sad as an American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, Boothby says, the official U.S. presence in Mozambique is heartening. Ambassador Melissa Wells presides over an active aid program, including the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded project, run by Save the Children, which took Boothby to Mozambique. U.S.  support for such programs will rise by a million dollars this year, over the nearly $ 350,000 appropriated in 1989, according to an AID official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other government and private projects are part of an international effort for Mozambican children. Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, is active, as are European aid programs, particularly from the Scandanavian countries.  Canada has long had a strong presence in the country. In the U.S., the Chicago-based Mozambique Support Net-work (MSN) has just launched a campaign to raise funds for an orphanage housing 30 children in Zambezia province, one of the areas hardest hit by Renamo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as long as Renamo can conduct its campaigns, there is a limited amount anyone can do to save the children of Mozambique. Renamo's style of building its base camps, where rings of civilians are confined between rings of Renamo soldiers in expanding concentric circles, discourages government troops from attacking -- even when they locate a Renamo stronghold and have the means to dislodge it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of U.S. policy argue that the Bush administration should be doing more to end the war, including putting pressure on South Africa to block support for Renamo, whether the aid program is covert, as in the past, or is unsanctioned by the current South African administration. &quot;It's important,&quot; says MSN's Lisa January, &quot;to identify exactly who is providing the support, both in South Africa and in the United States, and to see that it's stopped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the drive to ameliorate the suffering of those children who can be reached is continuing. Neil Boothby is back in Mozambique this week, to brief his replacement, who will join the effort to help the most severely disturbed children reforge their links with the human family.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senegal's opposition Labor Party has called for a government of national unity that would bring together the various parties competing for power in the west African nation. The party's secretary general, Abdoulaye Bathily, said the economic policies of the government of President Abdou Diouf have created an explosive domestic situation and that deteriorating relations between Senegal and its neighbors are a pressing concern.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senegal has been living under a harsh austerity program as part of a structural adjustment agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Abdou Latif Gueye, who heads a non-governmental organization that aids troubled young people, says the growing number of drug addicts, alcoholics and prostitutes reflects increasing unemployment and desperation.

A lack of voting materials was cited as the reason for the postponement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elections are the first free balloting in the Indian Ocean nation, which has been ruled for a decade and a half by authoritarian governments that have been backed -- and many believe, controlled -- by white mercenaries. That era appeared to end last November, when President Ahmed Abdallah was assassinated and mercenaries took direct control of the government, before being persuaded to leave three weeks later by France and South Africa. French officers replaced the mercenaries who had commanded the feared &quot;presidential guard,&quot; which has been renamed the Comoran Security Forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Comoros consists of three islands that declared independence from France in 1975. Mayotte, a fourth island in the group, retains its French ties. The islands, which have seemed a paradise to thousands of European tourists, are gripped by an economic crisis that has left government workers without pay for over three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election campaign has stirred intense popular interest in the devoutly Islamic country. Everywhere in the islands, crowds came out to greet the field of candidates, who range from a 70-year traditionalist serving as interim head of state to a 42-year-old Marxist recently released from prison.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC. -- When Congolese President Denis Sassou-Nguesso arrived here on the day Nelson Mandela was released in South Africa, it was clear that his visit would attract little media attention. But at the end of a three-day stay, which included a meeting and formal dinner with President George Bush at the White House, the 46-year old leader seemed pleased with the welcome he received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1986, while serving as chair of the Organization of African Unity, Sassou-Nguesso visited the U.S. but was denied a meeting with President Ronald Reagan. This time, as the first African leader accorded a state visit since Bush took office last January, the Congolese president literally received red carpet treatment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the formal arrival ceremony on the White House lawn on Feb. 12 until his send-off by helicopter two days later from the Washington Monument grounds -- to the accompaniment of military honor guards and a 21-gun salute -- much of the schedule was occupied by ceremonial activities. It was something the for-mer military man seemed to revel in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a breakfast meeting with reporters at Blair House, the official U.S. government guest house, Sassou-Nguesso talked about the prospects for an end to war in Angola, Congo's western neighbor. He said he was looking to another neighbor, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, who has assumed the task of mediating in Angola, to &quot;take some initiative.&quot; In a meeting earlier this month, he said he had encouraged the Zaire leader to become more active in promoting talks between the Angolan government and the Unita rebel movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he said he had discussed Angola with Bush, Sassou-Nguesso refused to criticize U.S. backing for Unita, despite Congo's good relationship with the Angolan government in Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are highlights of Sassou-Nguesso's remarks about his country's political and economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Is Congo a Marxist state?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sassou-Nguesso: We have always said that our long term goal is the building up of socialism in our country. But for the time being we are still laying the foundation of a nation and creating a democratic society. We need to make sure all national forces participate in the development of the affairs of our country. Economically, we favor the coexistence of the state sector, the mixed sector and the private sector, even the cooperative sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: The title &quot;peoples' republic&quot; conjures up in the West an image of a heavily government-dominated economic system such as has existed in China and eastern Europe, for example. To what extent do you want to abandon socialism and move to free market economics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sassou-Nguesso: We don't understand the comparison that is sometimes made between our country and eastern Europe, because we have never sought to imitate what is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">going on in other societies. We have always wanted to develop according to the wants of our people, taking into account the realities in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The openness our country has always had to private enterprise and a free market takes into account the situation we face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: Do you think that your country one day may have a multi-party political system?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sassou-Nguesso: Yes, of course, because we are not systematically opposed to the idea of multi-party systems. For your guidance, I must tell you that in the past we had a multi-party system. At the time of independence, there were many political parties in our country. It is from that experience and the strife which resulted that the people decided to have a one-party system. I think that normal development will lead to creation of multi-party systems in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: To what extent do you think the economic development of your country and of Africa in general is tied to the process of democratization?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sassou-Nguesso: I think that we have to set free -- to liberate -- productive forces and the initiative taken by people, and I think African leaders understand that very well. We first have to build stable states and create the bases of nations, with the participation of all the people. And I think if these conditions are created, we will move towards economic and political development because everyone will be participating in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: What percentage of your gross national product is represented by private enterprise?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sassou-Nguesso: Our gross national product comes mainly from oil, a sector mostly run by private companies. In the agriculture area, private enterprise accounts for about eighty percent of our production, and it's about the same for forestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: Do you expect any concrete economic benefits from your visit to the U.S.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sassou-Nguesso: We have felt some real interest on the part of several companies. And the government -- President Bush himself told me -- is committed to encouraging American investment. The bilateral investment treaty we have signed will serve as a basis for promoting that activity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberians in that country have grown to 56,000 and are continuing to rise. &quot;More people arrive from Liberia every day, and tell us their villages have been attacked,&quot; one refugee was quoted as saying. &quot;They have no choice but to try to escape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Gossopah, Guinea, Reuter reported that 80,000 Liberians are now exiled there. They are being fed and housed by the local inhabitants, themselves impoverished, with whom they share ethnic ties. &quot;We like the Liberians,&quot; Gossopah's chief Mussah Mamy told Reuter, &quot;they are our own people. But we wish there were a better road out of here so they could leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. has contributed $ 25,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross to aid the refugees. Other donors are expected to offer assistance following the release of recommendations from a United Nations High Commission for Refugees survey of conditions and needs, which was completed last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels are led by Charles Taylor, a former Liberian government official who has said in interviews with the BBC that he is seeking the overthrow of President Samuel K. Doe. But the incursion has not gathered popular support, despite the fact that Doe has many opponents in the country.  Taylor's background -- he fled Liberia for the U.S. in 1986 amid accusations of embezzlement -- and the methods adopted by his previously-unknown National Patriotic Forces of Liberia have won him little backing from established political groups or the general citizenry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels are said to have carried out hit and run attacks on villages and government installations. In retaliation, government troops are said by refugees to have destroyed villages and captured and killed civilians.  The troops are also reported to have engaged in sexual assaults on women in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Africa Watch, last month issued appeals for an end to extrajudicial executions.  Earlier this month, Africa Watch called upon the Bush administration to withdraw military advisors recently dispatched to work with Liberian forces in Nimba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department says the two advisors have accompanied the commander of the Liberian army, Gen. Moses Craig, to Nimba to advise on &quot;matters involved with restoring and maintaining discipline&quot; among government troops. In a recent interview, Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Herman Cohen said the presence of the two Americans has &quot;greatly helped&quot; improve the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a letter to Secretary of State James Baker, Africa Watch argued that the stated U.S. objective of minimizing abuses by military personnel has &quot;rarely been achieved&quot; in the places by the introduction of training programs and advisors. &quot;It is unclear whether the administration seriously believes that they can have any effect on an army alleged to have killed hundreds of civilians in the past six weeks,&quot; the organization said in a Feb. 2 statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the capital, Monrovia, news of the fighting in Nimba County has been filtering in slowly. But opposition political figures report a growing unease about the government's intentions towards its critics. Doe has already announced that funds designated for the registration of voters in preparation for elections in 1991 have been used to pay for the counter-insurgency effort.  Many of Doe's opponents expect him to interfere with the electoral process. He is widely believed to have manipulated the results of the last national election in 1985 to squeak out a narrow victory over the Liberian Action Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pervasive sense of fear was heightened last month by the brutal slaying of Robert Phillips, a former LAP leader who was one of several Doe opponents tried for treason in 1986. In the early hours of Jan. 4, relatives discovered Phillips' badly-beaten body in the bedroom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of his house in the capital. According to accounts provided by the rela-tives, his wrists were slashed to the bone, his fingers broken, and his throat was slit from ear to ear. Neighbors said they had seen four army troops and one civilian at the door before the slaying, the relatives report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official inquest into the murder ended abruptly, leading to suspicions of high level interference. A U.S. official, speaking on condition that he not be named, said last week that authorities in Monrovia have assured the American embassy that the investigation is continuing and the results will be made public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid student demonstrations charging a police cover-up, two British detectives and a pathologist arrived in Nairobi last week to help their Kenyan counterparts investigate the death of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The popular politician from the Lake Victoria area of western Kenya was found dead near his farm on Feb. 16, less than two weeks after returning from the United States, where he accompanied President Daniel arap Moi on a private visit. At a press conference in Washington,D.C., Ouko displayed the spirited defense of Kenyan policies for which he had become known during a decade as the country's chief foreign affairs official. He disputed charges of political repression, including concerns raised by the human rights group Amnesty International about political detentions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Moi said the circumstances of the foreign minister's death -- Ouko's body was found badly burned and with a gunshot wound -- suggest &quot;foul play,&quot; and that every effort would be made to find those responsible. Despite suggestions from some officials that the killing may have been linked to problems within the Ouko family, Kenyan newspaper reports fueled public speculation that the death may have been politically motivated. Comparisons were made to the assassinations of politicians Tom Mboya in 1969 and Josiah Kariuki six years later. However, both those figures were prominent government opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although official police statements issued when the body was found did not mention suicide as a possibility, several hundred students chanting, &quot;We want the truth,&quot; said the police were trying to present the death as a suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, environmentalist Wangari Maathai is trying to assume a low profile after her highly publicized protest against the construction of a 60-story commercial building in Nairobi's downtown Uhuru Park (see Africa News December 25, 1989). In the wake of her opposition to the building, Maathai was castigated by President Moi and other Kenyan officials, and her tree-planting organization, the Greenbelt Movement, was evicted from its offices. In recent weeks,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maathai has tried to avoid rehashing the issue but finds that it still haunts her. She has replied at some length to a statement by the member of parliament for Mount Elgon, Wilberforce Kisiero, who has banned her from his constituency. Maathai said she feared that the rural women who are the driving force behind the Greenbelt movement will be frightened away by the continuing controversy and that thousands of seedling trees may die for lack of care.  While Kenyans were wondering whether a ban against a Kenyan citizen traveling freely within the country could be enforced, the Kenyan government, under pressure from international donors, quietly agreed to postpone the tower complex, &quot;for the time being.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gambia celebrated a quarter century of independence on Feb. 18, in ceremonies marred by the deaths of three people among the 30,000 that were packed into a stadium in the capital, Banjul. Two Gambians and a West German tourist were killed when the gun of a policeman who was jostled by the crowd accidently discharged. In a somber independence message, Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara said the country had fallen short of its expectations of 25 years ago. Jawara said the Gambia's high rate of childhood deaths, its illiteracy, its lack of economic infrastructure and the gap between the living conditions of urban and rural areas are all signs of the country's weakness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gambia's improbable boundaries are a graphic reminder of Africa's colonial heritage, which carved the continent into pieces that ignored practical realities. The country is a 190 mile sliver of land -- averaging only 20 miles in width -- that juts into French-speaking Senegal along the Gambia River, one of Africa's most navigable waterways. Several post-independence attempts to unite the two neighbors have faltered, partly due to cultural and linguistic differences stemming from the colonial experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poor economic performance of the Gambia is an illustration that African countries have faced an uphill battle to prosperity, regardless of what path they have followed. At independence, the Gambia attempted to diversify its economy away from a dependence on peanuts, and -- unlike many developing countries -- it opted to concentrate its resources in agricultural production.  But the country's promising beginnings floundered, first when drought hit the Sahelian region, and then in the adverse economic climate of the 1980s. The country was set back, President Jawara told West Africa magazine, by a culmination of difficulties: &quot;the drought, the fall in the price of commodities and deteriorating terms of trade, high interest rates in developing countries, currency instability on the international scene, etc.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a multi-party democracy and champion of human rights both domestically and abroad, the Gambia had hoped for more support from the international community, but, in fact, Jawara says, there has been &quot;a considerable decline in the amount of official development assistance.&quot; Smallness, the president says, has meant a lack of power. Still, he says, Gambians can be proud of their sense of unity and of the democratic principles their small country has promoted around the world.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2062 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Socialism is undoubtedly in the throes of a crisis greater than at any time since 1917. The last half of 1989 saw the dramatic collapse of most of the communist party governments of eastern Europe. Their downfall was brought about through massive upsurges which had the support not only of the majority of the working class but also a large slice of the membership of the ruling parties themselves. These were popular revolts against unpopular regimes; if socialists are unable to come to terms with this reality, the future of socialism is indeed bleak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mounting chronicle of crimes and distortions in the history of existing socialism, its economic failures and the divide which developed between socialism and democracy, have raised doubts in the minds of many former supporters of the socialist cause as to whether socialism can work at all.  Indeed, we must expect that, for a time, many in the affected countries will be easy targets for those aiming to achieve a reversion to capitalism, including an embrace of its external policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shock-waves of very necessary self-examination have also been triggered off among communists both inside and outside the socialist world. For our part, we firmly believe in the future of socialism; and we do not dismiss its whole past as an unmitigated failure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Among other things, statistics recently published in The Economist (UK) show that in the Soviet Union - after only 70 years of socialist endeavour in what was one of the most backward countries in the capitalist world -- there are more graduate engineers than in the U.S., more graduate research scientists than in Japan and more medical doctors per head than in western Europe. It also produces more steel, fuel and energy than any other country.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Socialism certainly produced a Stalin and a Ceaucescu, but it also produced a Lenin and a Gorbachev. Despite the distortions at the top, the nobility of socialism's basic objectives inspired millions upon millions to devote themselves selflessly to building it on the ground. And, no one can doubt that if humanity is today poised to enter an unprecedented era of peace and civilized international relations, it is in the first place due to the efforts of the socialist world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is more vital than ever to subject the past of existing socialism to an unsparing critique in order to draw the necessary lessons. To do so openly is an assertion of justified confidence in the future of socialism and its inherent moral superiority. And we should not allow ourselves to be inhibited merely because an exposure of failures will inevitably provide ammunition to the traditional enemies of socialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commandist and bureaucratic approaches which took root during Stalin's time affected communist parties throughout the world, including our own. We cannot disclaim our share of the responsibility for the spread of the personality cult and a mechanical embrace of Soviet domestic and foreign policies, some of which discredited the cause of socialism. We kept silent for too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">long after the 1956 Krushchev revelations. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implications for socialism of the Stalinist distortions have not yet been evenly understood throughout our ranks. We need to continue the search for a better balance between advancing party policy as a collective and the toleration of on-going debate and even constructive dissent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do not pretend that our party's changing postures in the direction of democratic socialism are the results only of our own independent evolution.  Our shift undoubtedly owes a prime debt to the process of perestroika and glasnost which was so courageously unleashed under Gorbachev's inspiration.  Closer to home, the democratic spirit which dominated in the re-emerged trade union movement from the early 1970s onwards, also made its impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we can legitimately claim that in certain fundamental respects our indigenous revolutionary practice long ago ceased to be guided by Stalinist concepts. This is the case particularly in relation to the way the party performed its role as a working class vanguard, its relations with fraternal organizations and representatives of other social forces and, above all, its approach to the question of democracy in the post-apartheid state and in a future socialist South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have always believed (and we continue to do so) that it is indispensable for the working class to have an independent political instrument which safeguards its role in the democratic revolution and which leads it toward an eventual classless society. But such leadership must be won rather than imposed. Our claim to represent the historic aspirations of the workers does not give us an absolute right to lead them or to exercise control over society as a whole in their name. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This approach to the vanguard concept has not, as we know, always been adhered to in world revolutionary practice and in an earlier period we too were infected by the distortion. But, in our case, the shift which has taken place in our conception of 'vanguard' is by no means a post-Gorbachev phenomenon. The wording on this question in our new program is taken almost verbatim from our Central Committee's 1970 report on organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1970 document reiterated the need to safeguard, both in the letter and the spirit, the independence of the political expressions of other social forces whether economic or national. It rejected the old purist and domineering concept that all those who do not agree with the party are necessarily enemies of the working class. And it saw no conflict between our understanding of the concept of vanguard and the acceptance of the African National Congress as the head of the liberation alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the inevitable limitations which illegality imposed on our inner-party democratic processes, the principles of accountability and electivity of all higher organs were substantially adhered to. Seven underground Congresses of our party have been held since 1953. The delegates to Congress from the lower organs were elected without lists from above and always constituted a majority. The incoming Central Committees were elected by a secret ballot without any form of direct or indirect 'guidance' to the delegates. In other words, the Leninist concept of democratic centralism has not been abused to entrench authoritarian leadership practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our structures, down to the lowest units, have been increasingly encouraged to assess and question leadership pronouncements in a critical spirit and the views of the membership are invariably canvassed before finalizing basic policy documents. Our 7th Congress, which adopted our new program, &quot;The Path to Power&quot;, was a model of democratic consultation and spirited debate. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we have already noted, one of the most serious casualties in the divide which developed between democracy and socialism was in the one-sided relationship between the ruling parties and the mass organizations. In order to prevent such a distortion in a post-apartheid South Africa we have, for example, set out in our draft Workers' Charter that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trade unions and their federation shall be completely independent and answerable only to the decisions of their members or affiliates, democratically arrived at. No political party, state organ or enterprise, whether public, private or mixed, shall directly or indirectly interfere with such independence.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The substance of this approach is reflected in the way our party has in fact conducted itself for most of its underground existence. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do not regard the trade unions or the national movement as mere conduits for our policies. Nor do we attempt to advance our policy positions through intrigue or manipulation. Our relationship with these organizations is based on complete respect for their independence, integrity and inner-democracy. In so far as our influence is felt, it is the result of open submissions of policy positions and the impact of individual communists who win respect as among the most loyal, the most devoted and ideologically clear members of these organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Old habits die hard and among the most pernicious of these is the purist concept that all those who do not agree with the party are necessarily enemies of socialism. This leads to a substitution of name-calling and jargon for healthy debate with non-party activists. As already mentioned, our 7th Congress noted some isolated reversions along these lines and resolved to combat such tendencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, in general, the long-established and appreciable move away from old-style . . . sectarianism has won for our party the admiration and support of a growing number of non-communist revolutionary activists in the broad workers' and national movement. We also consider it appropriate to canvass the views of such activists in the formulation of certain aspects of our policy.  For example, we submitted our preliminary conception of the contents of a Workers' Charter for critical discussion not only in our own ranks but throughout the national and trade union movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our party's program holds firmly to a post-apartheid state which will guarantee all citizens the basic rights and freedoms of organization, speech, thought, press, movement, residence, conscience and religion; full trade union rights for all workers including the right to strike, and one person one vote in free and democratic elections. These freedoms constitute the very essence of our national liberation and socialist objectives and they clearly imply political pluralism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both for these historical reasons and because experience has shown that an institutionalized one-party state has a strong propensity for authoritarianism, we remain protagonists of multi-party post-apartheid democracy both in the national democratic and socialist phases. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows that, in truly democratic conditions, it is perfectly legitimate and desirable for a party claiming to be the political instrument of the working class to attempt to lead its constituency in democratic contest for political power against other parties and groups representing other social forces. And if it wins, it must be constitutionally required, from time to time, to go back to the people for a renewed mandate. The alternative to this is self-perpetuating power with all its implications for corruption and dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We dare not underestimate the damage that has been wrought to the cause of socialism by the distortions we have touched upon. We, however, continue to have complete faith that socialism represents the most rational, just and democratic way for human beings to relate to one another. . . .The all-round development of the individual and the creation of opportunities for every person to express his or her talents to the full can only find ultimate expression in a society which dedicates itself to people rather than profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opponents of socialism are very vocal about what they call the failure of socialism in Africa. (They conveniently ignore the fact that most of the countries which tried to create conditions for the building of socialism faced unending civil war, aggression and externally-inspired banditry; a situation in which it is hardly possible to build any kind of stable social formation -- capitalist or socialist.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they say little, if anything, about Africa's real failure; the failures of capitalism. Over 90% of our continent's people live out their wretched and repressed lives in stagnating and declining capitalist-oriented economies. International capital, to whom most of these countries are mortgaged, virtually regards cheap bread, free education and full employment as economic crimes. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way forward for the whole of humanity lies within a socialist framework guided by genuine socialist human-itarianism and not within a capitalist system which entrenches economic and social inequalities as a way of life. So-cialism can undoubtedly be made to work without the negative practices which have distorted many of its key objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But mere faith in the future of socialism is not enough. The lessons of past failures have to be learnt. Above all, we have to ensure that its fundamental tenet -- socialist democracy -- occupies a rightful place in all future practice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regular listeners to the broadcasts of Radio South Africa, have been able to track the fast pace of events in that country through the plethora of new voices on the air. Not only has the government-controlled overseas service been carrying the speeches and interviews of Nelson Mandela and other recent political prisoners, but it also has included in several newscasts the comments of Joe Slovo, the general secretary of the South African Communist Party (SACP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SACP spent the last 40 years as an outlawed organization -- a decade more than Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) -- before it was legalized along with other anti-apartheid movements on Feb. 2. Slovo, a lawyer from Johannesburg who has lived in exile since the early 1960s, has long been portrayed by the government and the South African media as a devil figure, a pawn of Moscow deceptively plotting intrigue and violent revolution from outside the country's borders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela quickly reaffirmed his admiration for the SACP, commending &quot;its sterling contribution to the struggle for democracy&quot; in his Cape Town speech on the day of his release and calling Slovo &quot;one of our finest patriots.&quot; The ANC national executive committee has declared that &quot;the historic alliance&quot; with the SACP will &quot;continue to function with the necessary restructuring,&quot; following the unbanning of both organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the party has not released membership figures, it has said that the numbers increased by 90% between 1984 and 1989. In a breakdown of members provided to the Johannesburg publication Work in Progress, the party said 70% are African, 16% white, 10% Indian, and 4% mixed-ancestry (&quot;Coloured&quot;). The externally-based members are drawn more heavily from ex-students, professionals and intelligentsia -- all of whom are more likely to seek exile -- than the workers, who comprise 75% of the party's members inside the country, a SACP official stated in written answers to Work in Progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future of the party is now unclear, in the wake not only of its unbanning but also of the demise of Communist Party rule in eastern Europe, where the SACP has enjoyed close relations. Last month, before de Klerk's action, Slovo published a critique entitled &quot;Has Socialism Failed?&quot; It is intended, he has said, to spark discussion and debate about the party's practices and policies, both within and outside the organization. The paper has been widely discussed in anti-apartheid circles in South Africa; major portions were published by the Johannesburg weekly, the New Nation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day of Mandela's release, police manned roadblocks along the access road into Victor Verster prison, mainly to control the flow of traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By midday, a 4,000-strong crowd of ecstatic African National Congress supporters and journalists had encircled the gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were two types of organization set up to control the crowds and ensure the occasion went off smoothly. Marshals from the United Democratic Front (UDF) maintained strict control over foreign and local television crews and photographers. A makeshift rope barrier was strung across the verge of the road opposite the entrance and the crews were instructed to remain behind it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This prompted some quick improvisation from the media people. Some had brought their own portable ladders. Others simply climbed onto the roofs of taxis and vans. One TV station had the foresight to hire an old municipal crane with a platform to hold the camera crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warning from the marshals that if anyone stepped out of line, Mandela would simply be taken by car straight to Cape Town had the desired effect. None of the photographers broke the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other UDF marshals linked arms and formed a human chain to prevent the chanting crowd from blocking the prison entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the ring of marshals, about 100 uniformed police strolled around while their officers maintained radio contact with authorities inside the prison. Sometimes the two systems of law and order cooperated with each other. At other times they engaged in light-hearted competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the day, the &quot;people's police&quot; -- dressed in the khaki uniforms of the ANC -- could be seen talking to the government police in their blue SAP uniforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 4:10 P.mM., the police contingent formed a human barrier between the crowd and the marshalls and signalled that Mandela was about to come out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's walking,&quot; yelled a photographer. &quot;He's walking to his freedom.&quot; -- E.K.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a special edition marking the release from prison of Nelson Mandela, the South African newspaper Weekly Mail described the frantic, behind-the scenes effort that greeted the announcement that Mandela would be freed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elaborate groundwork and logistics for the reception of Nelson Mandela were planned and executed by members of the Mass Democratic Movement, literally overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheryl Carolus, publicity secretary for the United Democratic Front (UDF) in the western Cape said that Dullah Omar, Mandela's attorney, and other anti-apartheid leaders, were notified of the impending release by phone calls from the office of President F.W. de Klerk, just an hour and a half before the president's news conference on Feb. 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional reception committee in the western Cape had a basic framework in place but no immediate plans to carry out the vast task of organizing for the people of Cape Town to welcome Mandela.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we knew at 3:30 P.M.,&quot; Carolus says. &quot;At 5:30 we convened a local reception committee meeting and by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7 P.M. we were able to hold a much larger meeting of senior comrades who volunteered to do the work. Everything had to be arranged from scratch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jets had to be chartered to bring members of the Mandela family as well as the Rivonia trialists &cent;who were convicted and sentenced along with Mandela 27 years ago/. Accommodation had to be arranged for visiting dignitaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health services had to be provided at both the prison and the rally.  Banners needed painting. Marshalls needed to be recruited and briefed. Posters and pamphlets to advertise the event had to be printed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there was the brigade of journalists from the world's richest and most powerful media corporations who were relying on the Mass Democratic Movement to arrange for them to get the first pictures and interviews with Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within an hour, Carolus says, sub-committees had been formed, tasks identified and the work set in motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We worked through the night, and at times it seemed that nothing was impossible for us to do,&quot; she says. &quot;The Western Cape Traders Association agreed to provide the taxis for transport. The mayor and deputy mayor of Cape Town were amazing. They agreed to throw the city open to Mandela. That's how we got the Grand Parade for the rally and the Cape Town civic center for the press conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work committee decided to print 4,000 posters and 210,000 pamphlets. &quot;We phoned Allied Press in Elsie's River and asked them to be on standby to print,&quot; says Carolus. They said, 'We understand. We are all in the trenches together. We'll get the job done.' By 2 A.M. on Sunday the posters and pamphlets were done, free of charge. An army of volunteers was ready to take them into the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there were the banners. &quot;In the middle of the night,&quot; Carolus says, &quot;we ran out of calico. So someone went and woke up a few businessmen.  They agreed to open their factories at three in the morning. They gave us the material for free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carolus faced the task of dealing with the army of television crews and photographers who wanted to be at the prison exit to get the first pictures. The reception committee's solution, which was met with some loud grumbling, was to set up a 14-camera pool to take the photos and visuals and share them with other journalists. An infrastructure of first aid services for the day was set up by a volunteer group of doctors and health workers. By 6 a.m. the posters had been put up. The pamphlets were distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just over two hours later, the first of the Lear jets arrived, with Rivonia trialists and other dignitaries of the resistance movement on board.  Food, accommodation, and transport had been arranged. And the banners were being put up on the Grand Parade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the release of Nelson Mandela, United Democratic Front leader Patrick &quot;Terror&quot; Lekota made a promise to an appreciative group of Americans. South Africans, he said, will establish &quot;the kind of government which will make you and us proud -- which will not make you ashamed to stand before the world tomorrow and say, We supported those people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the dramatic changes of recent weeks, the gulf dividing the government and its opponents is large and the transition to a new order will not be easy. With the first tentative steps underway toward negotiating South Africa's future, the complexities of the process are coming into clearer focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government seems to be approaching the process with a four-year timetable in mind. President F.W. de Klerk's comfortable margin in last year's all-white general elections will enable him to remain in office under the current constitution until late 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mandela's now-legalized African National Congress (ANC) and its allies in what is called the &quot;mass democratic movement&quot; (MDM), there are also time considerations, though of a different nature. They arise from a commitment to a consultative approach that by definition is time consuming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key negotiating points will have to be &quot;rigorously and democratically discussed in our structures,&quot; says Jay Naidoo, general secretary of Cosatu, the powerful trade union federation that is a key constituent of the MDM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High level meetings between the government and the recently-unbanned ANC already are being planned, ushering in the phase commentators have labeled 'talks about talks.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no longer need to kick down the door,&quot; de Klerk said in a Feb. 15 interview with Ted Koppel on ABC's Nightline. The ANC and other groups &quot;must walk across the threshold and start to talk,&quot; he said. De Klerk announced the unbanning of the ANC and other opposition groups in a Feb. 2 address to Parliament and Mandela was released after 27 years of imprisonment on Feb. 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a first step toward talks, Mandela and the ANC have said the government must remove remaining obstacles to free expression: lifting the state of emergency and releasing all remaining political prisoners. &quot;We insist that they comply with those preconditions,&quot; Mandela said in an interview with Charlayne Hunter-Gault on the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour, &quot;and then there will be room for further progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaching a compromise on these issues should not prove very difficult, according to Professor Willem de Klerk, a former Afrikaans newspaper editor and elder brother of the president. The government has come to realize that &quot;the ANC is the solution and apartheid is the problem,&quot; a recent reversal in thinking that accounts for the sudden turnabout in policy, he said in a telephone interview from his office at Rands Afrikaans University in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of emergency will be lifted as soon as the continuing violence in Natal province can be ended, Willem de Klerk says. He predicts that in return for freeing the remaining political prisoners, the government will ask for the release of white South Africans jailed in neighboring countries for infiltrating ANC ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC has already outlined its terms for meeting a key government demand -- ending the armed struggle. Rejecting calls for a &quot;unilateral moratorium or suspension&quot;, the ANC national executive committee in a Feb. 16 statement said a &quot;suspension of hostilities by both sides&quot; should be worked out &quot;upon creation of a climate conducive to negotiations,&quot; meaning after the ANC's preconditions for negotiations are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the focus of attention has turned towards talks, there are voices in South Africa still opposed to the process. The Pan Africanist Congress, a rival offshoot of the ANC which was also banned in 1960 and unbanned this month, remains deeply suspicious of de Klerk's intentions.  In a statement welcoming Mandela's release, the PAC expressed doubts that talks could bring about the &quot;return of usurped land&quot; and &quot;self determination for the oppressed majority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The white Conservative Party, which received 30% of the vote in last year's election and is the official opposition in Parliament, is demanding a new election to test de Klerk's popularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But from most quarters the emphasis is on what Thabo Mbeki, the director of foreign relations for the ANC, calls &quot;the beginning of a process which hopefully is going to result in a peaceful resolution.&quot; Willem de Klerk expects that preconditions can be satisfied and &quot;pre-negotiations&quot; initiated by May or June, with the initial sessions focussing on procedures and an agenda for formal negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most observers expect the government to be represented in these early talks by Cabinet ministers who have been meeting with Mandela in prison for the past several years, led by Gerrit Viljoen, minister of constitutional development. The team is likely to include Foreign Minister Roelof 'Pik' Botha, Education Minister Stoffel van de Merwe, and the ministers of justice and police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC has said its negotiating team will be drawn both from leaders based inside the country and members of the externally-based national executive committee (NEC). Currently, a three-person committee is directing the organization in exile during the illness of President Oliver Tambo -- Secretary General Alfred Nzo, Treasurer Thomas Nkobi and Thabo Mbeki, who, among the three, is the one most likely to participate directly in the first round of meetings. Inside South Africa, the ANC is relying heavily on Walter Sisulu, who has already been designated by the national executive to head an internally-based working group to prepare for the relocation of headquarters from Lusaka, Zambia to Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another likely participant in the talks is Cyril Ramaphosa, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, who has played a leading part in the national reception committee that has coordinated Mandela's schedule since his release. His central role is a sign of the importance of trade union support for any eventual agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the issues of the first phase are being resolved between the ANC and the government, Willem de Klerk expects formal negotiations to include many more groups, with the ANC and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the government, on the other, as the main actors. Those talks could get underway by the middle of next year, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the mass democratic movement, the main goals of negotiations are clear -- the creation of a nonracial, democratic system with equal opportunity for all. But many unanswered questions remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None is more important or controversial than economic policy.  Mandela's reiteration of a long-standing ANC call for nationalization of the nation's mines and banks was met with a torrent of criticism. &quot;That would kill the goose that lays the golden egg,&quot; President de Klerk told Koppel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC may decide to alter its long-standing nationalization plank, but the problem of a wide disparity in income in South Africa will continue to be of paramount importance to the broad constituencies represented in the MDM.  &quot;We have always viewed the struggle for national liberation as part of an uninterrupted struggle for social and economic emancipation,&quot; says Cosatu's Jay Naidoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any negotiations, the MDM will be seeking ways to safeguard the interests of all those represented in its structures, he says -- including trade unions, youth groups, women's organizations, and community structures.  &quot;There must always be a significant role for these organizations in any post-apartheid society,&quot; he says, in an interview published this month in the Johannesburg weekly, the New Nation. &quot;We have to insure that the society is fully democratized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vigorous debates about future policies have been taking place within MDM structures for some months. One area of discussion has been about ways to protect &quot;the collective rights of our constituencies,&quot; Naidoo says -- in addition to the protections of individual rights that a Bill of Rights in the constitution should offer. Cosatu already is circulating a draft labor charter aimed at safeguarding workers' interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rights and role of women have also been a lively topic of contention, taking up as much as half the discussion time in some of the recent sessions that preceded the Conference for a Democratic Future in December (see Africa News, December, 25, 1989).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That rigorously democratic process is part of &quot;the promise we have made,&quot; says the UDF's Lekota, &quot;that if we were supported, we would set up a government that would be worthy of human beings. We intend to live up to that promise.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1884 At the April 24 Berlin Conference that divided Africa among Euro- pean powers, South West Africa becomes a protectorate of Germ- any, beginning a period of genocide in which more than 100,000 Africans are killed by the occupying forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1890 Despite fierce resistance by the local population, the region becomes a German colony.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1915 South Africa, fighting with allied powers during World War I, con-quers South West Africa. German forces surrender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1920 Following Germany's defeat in World War I, South Africa assumes control of the territory under a League of Nations mandate on December 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1933 The League of Nations objects to a South African plan to annex the former German colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1960 The South West Africa People's Organization (Swapo) is established.  Ethiopia and Liberia apply to the International Court of Justice for a judgement against South Africa for illegally occupying the territory. Two years later, the Court refuses to rule on the application, saying the two countries have no standing in the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1966 Under Resolution 2145, the United Nations General Assembly revokes South Africa's mandate to govern the territory.  In August, the first armed con-frontation between South African forces and Swapo fighters is reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1967 The United Nations officially recog-nizes the name, Namibia, adopted by the independence movement and derived from the word Namib -- meaning shield or enclosure in the Nama-Damara language. (Namib is also the name of the coastal desert region.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1969 The UN Security Council endorses the General Assembly's authority in Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1971 In June, the International Court of Justice declares South African occupation of Namibia illegal. Six months later, Namibian contract workers stage the largest national strike to date. The action effectively curtails production at most of the territory's industries and consolidates the independence movement's position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1975 In an attempt to find an internal solution to increasing opposition, South Africa convenes the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference with representatives from all Namibia's ethnic groups. Swapo rejects the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1977 South Africa and Swapo agree to allow the five Western countries of the Security Council -- who come to be known as the Contact Group (U.S., France, West Germany, Canada and Great Britain) -- to mediate nego-tiations on Namibian independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1978 In April, the Contact Group introduces a &quot;Proposal for a Settle-ment of the Namibian Situation&quot; -- the forerunner to Resolution 435, which establishes the formula for independence -- to the UN Security Council. The next month, a South African raid on the Kasinga refugee camp in Angola kills over 600 Namibian women and children.  In August, Martti Ahtisaari, appointed as the newly-created Special Representative for Namibia to the UN Secretary-General, goes to Namibia to investigate the possibility of elections. The following month, Resolution 435 is adopted by the UN Security Council. South Africa continues to try to solve the conflict internally, by holding December elections, which Swapo boycotts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1982 In an attempt to persuade South Africa to implement Resolution 435, the UN Security Council adopts a set of constitutional principles. The Reagan administration launches a diplomatic initiative linking Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola with Namibian independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1987 Thousands of copper miners from the Tsumeb Corporation in northern Namibia hold a month-long strike. With labor actions occurring throughout the country, the worker's move-ment gains prominence as an important opponent to South African rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Windhoek, Namibia -- For several weeks now, officials of the Namibian government that assumed power on March 21 have been trying to determine what funds would be left in the treasury to pay salaries and other ongoing costs of running a country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independence means the loss of an annual South African subsidy of $ 200 million to the Namibian budget, even while the Namibian economy remains intertwined with South Africa's. In addition, there is concern that a South African privatization strategy, pursued with increasing vigor in the pre-independence period, has denied the new government control over significant economic resources. The result, some here fear, may be a continuing dependence on outside donors, including South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibian Finance Minister Otto Herrigel has harshly condemned as &quot;plunder&quot; a South African decision last October to privatize assets of employee pension funds. An estimated $ 270 million -- one study puts the amount at nearer$ 400 million -- has been transferred from the formerly state-controlled Statutory Institutions Pension Fund to major South African insurance firms, including Sanlam, Old Mutual and Southern Life.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move has stripped the new Namibian government of its major potential source of local investment capital, which officials had planned to use to initiate productive enterprises and generate jobs -- an urgent task in a country with 25-30% unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another effect of the transfer, Herrigel says, was to encourage resignations by experienced civil servants entitled to full pension benefits -- many of whom the new administration had hoped to persuade to stay on the job.  The finance minister says the government will seek full restitution of the funds from the South African companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privatization has been implemented or attempted in several other areas as well, notably the transportation industry. A reported attempt by conservative church groups to purchase public schools using government loan funds collapsed after angry debate over the issue in the newly-elected Constituent Assembly. Delegates argued that the Namibian government will be forced to build more schools -- not sell off existing ones -- to meet the educational needs of the nation's children, especially in the former war zones of the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy of transferring state assets to private hands was developed by an eight-person Privatization Advisory Committee, set up in 1988 with approval from the Cabinet. The committee compiled a priority privatization list for 20 specific economic areas -- culled from more than 100 that were proposed initially. Among the activities targeted were resorts and conservation efforts, posts and telecommunications, hospital and medical services, including laboratory and pharmaceutical entities, and security services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the hardest goals for the new nation of Namibia to achieve will be extricating its economic priorities from those of the South African economy. In fact, increasing numbers of white businessmen and farmers have begun to chaff at the tendency of South Africa to use Namibia as a &quot;captive&quot; market and to limit the access of Namibian goods to overseas markets. So the attempt to expand Namibia's economic opportunities, independent of South African interests, promises to be a cause around which both black and white Namibians can rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge is multifaceted. The South African rand has served as Namibia's currency, and is likely to continue to do so for at least the next two years. According to Herrigel, only one of Namibia's seven banks is controlled by local capital. For years, most individual savings or foreign exchange earnings deposited in banks, retirement funds, building societies and insurance companies in Namibia have been transferred routinely to South African firms. A labor researcher has estimated that as much as $ 46 million of such funds are passing from Namibia to South Africa each month -- an annual amount equal to 38.5% of Namibia's gross domestic product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, South African banks appear to have been transferring to their Namibian branches large portions of the debt incurred by the previous authorities in Namibia -- a move that may make the inherited debt more difficult for the new government to repudiate. Swapo officials say much of the debt was incurred for South Africa's war effort against the independence movement, as well as for the costly ethnic-based administrations dictated by apartheid policies. Latest figures indicate that the amount owed by the South West African administration may be around $ 192 million -- a sum Swapo says is the responsibility of South Africa, not the Namibian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the highest priorities of Agriculture Minister Gerhard Hanekom is to make Namibia self-sufficient in food. &quot;It is good and well that we are producing diamonds,&quot; Hanekom says. &quot;But we cannot eat diamonds.&quot; Hanekom also is concentrating on the urgent need for jobs in agriculture and in rural development. Opportunities for such expansion are seen as particularly ripe in the north, where production has been curtailed by the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanekom is also responsible for fisheries, water and rural development, a job as imposing as its name. Among the ministry's first moves is extending Namibia's territorial waters to 200 miles offshore, to protect the rich fishing grounds that, until now, have been exploited mostly by South African fleets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the issues perplexing agricultural policymakers is how best to end the exclusion of Ovambo cattle from the national beef market. Since early this century, cattle from Ovamboland were separated from those of southern areas by the &quot;red line&quot; -- a double fence designed to reduce cattle migration.  Built in response to a widespread outbreak of diseases that decimated white farmers' herds, the barrier effectively excludes cattle owned by Africans from white-dominated farming and market regions to the south. In the past, cattle vaccination programs were not extended north of the red line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proposal currently being considered would move the demarcation line northwards to the Angolan border and extend extension services to black communal farmers as well as white commercial farmers. But any changes must be made cautiously, to avoid Namibian meat being excluded from overseas markets.  The European Economic Community, for example, would balk at purchasing meat not guaranteed free of infestation by hoof and mouth disease or other easily-spread cattle ailments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting the beef to market, though, presents another challenge. South Africa retains control of Namibia's largest port, a deepwater facility in the enclave of Walvis Bay which is the terminus of Namibia's rail lines to the outside world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the area's only viable commercial port, Walvis Bay handles some 90% of Namibia's imports and exports. Government officials fear that South Africa will now significantly boost port fees, exercising a continuing influence over Namibia's economic development strategy. In addition, Walvis Bay is the site of nearly all the factories that process the Namibian fish catches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, African leaders attending a special meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Lusaka, Zambia, called on South Africa to give up sovereignty over the enclave and the adjacent islands.  There has been speculation that a compromise plan, giving Namibia administrative authority, might be concluded between Pretoria and the new government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the favorable side of the economic ledger, officials say, is the increasing interest by foreign companies in Namibia's investment opportunities. The new National Planning Commission, headed by an Oxford-educated Namibian official of the Rossing Uranium Mine, is registering record numbers of companies that want to explore local opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An element in the growing confidence shown by businesses is the reiteration by Trade and Industry Minister Ben Amathila that the government has no plans to nationalize the mining sector. Mining is the source of 75% of Namibia's foreign exchange earnings and accounts for 25% of the country's tax base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Swapo does want to see a greater share of the profits reinvested inside Namibia, officials say.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ovamboland, Namibia -- Unexpectedly abundant rains, like a blessing bestowed with independence, have come to northern Namibia, turning a hot, barren terrain into an unexpectedly lush green. Large pools of water look almost like rice paddies, as men and women dot the fields, hoeing and planting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The landscape, bursting with new life and energy, seems to reflect the jubilant mood of the people here. Bordered by Angola to the north, the area was a stronghold of independence sentiment in the long war against South African rule, and local residents have high expectations for the new government in Windhoek, an eight-hour drive to the south.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Casspir armored vehicles of the South African Defense Force -- once a familiar sight on northern roads -- have been heading south for weeks, flanked front and back by United Nations escorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Namibian activist says that the Casspirs are so hated a symbol of South Africa's military occupation and harassment of civilians that they cannot be used in this area, even though the new government is desperately short of transport vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Okatana Mission a few miles from the town of Oshikati, over a hundred Namibian children play lively games in the gathering dusk, racing the wire cars and trucks they have constructed from pieces of scrap. The children are among the more than 40,000 Namibians who returned home after the repatriation of refugees that began last May. Many of their families are still without homes and there are no boarding school places available, so the mission population is likely to remain swollen for some time to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Hubert, one of the Okatana priests, has been in the area for five years. He regales visitors with stories of the times that South African soldiers tried to search for suspected Swapo members at the mission. Once, he says, soldiers entered church while he was conducting worship. &quot;I was so angry,&quot; he recalls. &quot;How dare they interrupt a service to God? They finally got embarrassed and left, but they surrounded the church and waited.&quot; (An activist later recounts how the mission sisters, fearing that he was about to be detained and tortured, once helped smuggle him away from the area.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Father Hubert, a key sign of peace is the ending of the curfew.  People were unable to move around, he says. &quot;And the South Africans would always shoot from several directions during the middle of the night, just to keep people awake and afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much to the delight of staff members, the numerous benches outside the Human Rights Center in Ondangua sit empty. &quot;They used to be filled to overflowing,&quot; a Center worker says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the November elections and the departure of the South African Defense Forces, reports of human rights abuses have dropped to a trickle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs of the November elections still abound -- slogans of the competing parties painted on the sides of buildings, a lonely and abandoned-looking campaign center of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, painted in crisp red, white and blue. But here in Ovamboland, which -- with nearby Kavango and Caprivi -- is home to 70% of Namibia's people, the dominant colors are Swapo's red, green and blue. Small postcard-size flags flutter jauntily atop thatch-roofed houses, bars, poles and incongruously-large trees. A young girl sports plastic shoes in Swapo colors. An old woman shelters from the sun under a Swapo umbrella.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The road from Ondangua is a strip of small bars, grocery stores, shops and shantytowns, interspersed with police and military bases that look mostly unused. Untag -- the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group, which monitored the independence process -- maintained a major observation post at Ondangua. The road used to be alive with trucks and vehicles; now, there is only the occasional sentry posted at sand-bagged check points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the local economy across the north revolved around servicing the consumer needs of South African soldiers and the Namibian units they supervised. The departure of the troops and police has caused a decline in business, although the general sentiment appears to be satisfaction that they are gone. Many exiles have had no work since returning to Namibia, and they are waiting for the new government to take full command of government ministries, hoping that the result will be more jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the legacies of the war economy is a throw-away consumer culture, visible in roadside piles of old beer and soda cans. An Untag official says this habit of waste may be one of the hardest effects of the South African presence to overcome. Northern Namibians have become accustomed to discarding items that in many poor countries are carefully hoarded and recycled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before independence, Swapo declared a half-day holiday to encourage the clean-up of the unsightly trash piles that also are creating a health hazard. Families could be seen working together in front of their small houses, raking the ground and piling up rubbish for collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More difficult to clean up are the damaged schools and clinics and homes that litter the north. The task of reconstruction is immense, as is the challenge of eliminating racial segregation from Namibia's social services and institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a teachers training college in Ondangua, the Namibian National Student Organization called together students from across the northern region to discuss the restructuring of education and the improvement of learning conditions for students and teachers alike. Members of the newly-formed Namibian Teachers Association, also invited to the meeting, faced hard questions. Teachers, some students said, had not challenged the system of apartheid education strongly enough and had acted, instead, to protect their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering was a harbinger of the many tough questions that will be asked when the euphoria of independence begins to die down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the biggest task facing the Swapo government is the need to respond quickly to the raised expectations, especially here in the north where the brunt of the war was felt most acutely. Still, it is clear to an outside observer that the new authorities have assumed control with the advantage of massive support from across this region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carole Collins visited Namibia at the end of a 4-year assignment as Southern Africa international affairs representative for the American Friends Service Committee.  She now resumes her career as a journalist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials of the new Namibian government are drawn largely from the ranks of Swapo, the independence movement which won last November's election. However, several positions are filled by representatives of other political organizations, and appointees are drawn from most of the country's diverse ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Shafilshuna Nujoma, the president of the country, has been the leader of Swapo since the movement was formally launched in 1960. A man whose deliberateness is sometimes seen as an absence of charisma, Nujoma has won respect and loyalty through his solid, steady leadership, Swapo insider's say.  Born on May 12, 1929 in Okahao, in the northern area known as Ovamboland, he attended the Finnish Mission school in the town from 1937 to 1948, before moving to the black township in Windhoek, the capital, to enroll in night school. As Swapo president, Nujoma has travelled throughout the world to lobby for independence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hage Gottfried Geingob, the prime minister, is a member of Swapo's political bureau, the group's top decision-making body, and served as election director during last year's campaign. Known for his charm and his warmth, he was described by one journalist as a &quot;huggy-bear of a man.&quot; Born in Otjiwarongo in 1941, Geingob joined the independence movement in 1962, and from 1964 to 1971, he represented Swapo at the UN and in the U.S. He accepted a United Nations post in 1972 and three years later became the first director of the UN Institute for Namibia in Lusaka, Zambia. In anticipation of independence, the institute has provided training in a wide variety of skills to hundreds of Namibians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the other Swapo veterans in the cabinet are Hifikepunye Pohamba, home affairs; Theo-Ben Gurirab, foreign affairs; Peter Mueshihange, defence; Nahas Angula, education, culture and sport; Hidipo Hamutenya, information and broadcasting; Ngarikutuke Tjiriange, justice; Nicky Iyambo, health and social services; Richard Kapelwa, works, transport and communications; Libertine Appolus-Amathila -- the only woman minister -- local government and housing; and her husband, Ben Amathila, trade and industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the Swapo appointees held senior, and in most cases parallel, positions in the exiled leadership of Swapo prior to their return to Namibia for the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sentimental favorite in the new administration is the minister of mines and industry, Swapo Secretary General Andimba Toivo ya Toivo, who has been called Namibia's &quot;Nelson Mandela.&quot; One of the founders of the independence movement, Toivo was arrested with 36 others, convicted of treason by the South African administration in 1967, and imprisoned until 1984. His deputy minister is Helmut Angula, who has been Swapo's permanent representative at the United Nations since 1986, when his predecessor Theo-Ben Gurirab was appointed Swapo foreign secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government also includes several Swapo leaders who remained inside Namibia throughout the independence struggle. Swapo Vice President Hendrik Witbooi is the minister of labor; Nico Bessinger, a Windhoek architect, is minister of wildlife, conservation, and tourism; Marco Hausiku, president of the teachers union, is minister of lands, resettlement and rehabilitation.  Daniel Tjongarero is deputy minister of information, and Buddy Wentworth is education deputy. Hartmut Ruppel, a German-born Windhoek lawyer who jointed Swapo in 1980, is the attorney general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swapo officials in other top posts include Richard Tsheehama, minister of state for security, and deputy ministers Jerry Ekandjo, local government; Timothy Hadino Hishongwa, labor; Pendukeni Ithana, wildlife; Nangola Ithete, home affairs; Phillemon Malima, defense; Kaire Mbuende, agriculture; and Marcus Shivute, lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two white cabinet members are both businessmen with no active political histories -- Minister of Finance Otto Herrigel, an economist, and Gerhard Hanekom, minister of agriculture, fisheries, water and rural development. Karl Klaus Dierks, a German-born engineer, is deputy minister of works, transport and communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of other political parties in deputy ministerial positions include Vekuii Reinhard Rukuro, president of Swanu and of the Namibian National Front, which won one seat in the assembly. Reggie Diergaardt, deputy minister of trade and industry, is head of the Labour Party and national chairman of the United Democratic Front, which holds four seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hans Berker was selected by Nujoma to be chief justice of the Supreme Court, the same position he held prior to independence.  In its first sitting, the new National Assembly elected another Swapo veteran, Mose Penaani Tjitendero as speaker.  Chosen as deputy speaker was Mburumba Kerina, an important figure in the early history of Swapo, who left in a disagreement with Nujoma and other Swapo leaders in 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bibliographical information on Namibian officials was drawn partly from the Namibian Handbook and Political Who's Who, by Joe Putz, Heidi Von Egidy, and Perri Caplan (post-election edition, 1990), the Magus Company, P. O. Box 22791, Windhoek 9000, Namibia, Tel: 264-61-37930, Fax: 37908.</SPAN></P>

UN officials are reporting that the job was done with money to spare.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the start of the monitoring effort on April 1, 1989, the UN Security Council engaged in heated debate over the efforts of the permanent members -- led by the United States -- to cut both the size of the force and the proposed outlay. Over African objections, the council approved $ 416 millionin expenditures. The Africa Group feared that without larger UN resources, South Africa, which remained in administrative control of the territory, could not be prevented from influencing the outcome of the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures released by the UN show that 7,900 staff, drawn from 109 nations, were part of Untag at its peak. There were 4,300 military personnel and 1,500 police; the rest were civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian operation was the largest -- and by many accounts the most successful -- peacekeeping effort in the organization's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current projections indicate that $ 367 million will be spent by the end of the mandate on March 31, with a few additional bills still to be paid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Windhoek -- Namibia, Africa's newest nation, this week is turning its attention to the difficult tasks of governance, following five days of celebrations surrounding independence on March 21. &quot;From this day on, our people will have the chance to shape their own future,&quot; President Sam Nujoma said in his independence day speech to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma was named president by the Constituent Assembly, elected last November in voting monitored by a United Nations observer team. After 23 years of war and a year-long independence process, the country is now face-to-face with new realities -- most seriously, a stark disparity in living standards between the majority and a privileged minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deep divisions resulting from years of bitter conflict clearly remain.  Swapo won 41 of the 72 seats in the Constituent Assembly, which is now the country's parliament -- enough to choose the government, but not the two-thirds required to approve a new constitution. Despite continuing tensions, however, the assembly's seven rival parties managed in just 80 days to reach consensus on a document that enshrines broad democratic guarantees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having experienced the possibilities of reconciliation, the new nation marched onto the world stage with a sense of having triumphed. Citizens threw themselves into the continuing festivities, which included sporting events and a national service of thanksgiving. Namibia is, statistically, the world's most Christian nation, and the service at the national stadium attracted church leaders from around the world, such as South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Jesse Jackson from the United States. Rock and gospel concerts followed on the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, speaking at the independence celebrations at midnight on March 20, saluted Namibians for &quot;a remarkable lesson to the whole world in the effectiveness of democratic procedures.&quot; President Nujoma said Namibia &quot;has blazed the trail to freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma thanked the international community for &quot;many years of consistent support for our cause.&quot; He said that &quot;the impressive presence&quot; of so many government leaders was evidence that Namibia's independence &quot;is an event of great world importance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turnout from all parts of the globe was almost more than the small country could handle. At the airport, where two or three flights come in on a normal day, there were so many pre-independence arrivals that at several points planes had to sit on the pavement waiting a turn at the official receiving gate for their VIP passengers. An appeal was issued for volunteers to bring vehicles to help ferry guests the 27 miles to town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official representation from Africa was, not surprisingly, the largest. Leading the list of heads of state were Egyptian President Hosni Mubarek, the current chairman of the Organization of African Unity, and Kenneth Kuanda, chairman of the frontline states in southern Africa, joined by their counterparts from Angola, Botswana, Cape Verde, Congo, Djibouti, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania. Other countries sent high-level delegations as well. U.S. Secretary of State James Baker was joined in attendance by the foreign ministers from three other world powers -- the Soviet Union, Britain and West Germany. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat also was on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy rain, which stopped just before the ceremonies began, contributed to a traffic jam that delayed the arrival of dignitaries and the beginning of the ceremonies. The stadium was filled to near-capacity -- and the VIP section was jammed -- when Nelson Mandela stepped through a doorway at the top of the seats behind the official dais, evoking a thunderous ovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both South African State President F.W. de Klerk and Perez de Cuellar gave short addresses before the South African flag was lowered at 12:17 A.M.  and the new blue, red, green, and gold flag was raised. After the banner was hoisted, the UN secretary general administered the oath of office to Nujoma.  Seated side-by-side during the proceedings, the three men exchanged friendly greetings and chatted amiably. Following the festivities, which included a 20-minute fireworks display, de Klerk was the first leader to walk down a red-carpeted pathway to congratulate Nujoma, by then seated in a ceremonial chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also present in large numbers were representatives of anti-apartheid organizations that have actively supported the independence campaign. As special guests of the new government, they took part in two state dinners, one given by de Klerk and the other by Nujoma, and two stadium celebrations -- the midnight hand-over and a rally the following afternoon at which the new Cabinet was installed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his speech at the rally, Nujoma paid homage to &quot;martyrs of our struggle&quot; and gave thanks to the United Nations for its role in winning Namibia's freedom. He also expressed &quot;our deepest gratitude&quot; to the international organizations and individuals &quot;who for so many years have stood by us in our struggle and lent us valuable material assistance and moral support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of the President's address was forward looking, outlining in broad terms the new government's policies. Nujoma cited as Namibia's biggest challenge the fact that two-thirds of the population &quot;are very poor by our standards and by the standards of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called mass unemployment &quot;one of the most crippling legacies of colonialism&quot; and appealed to the country's people to continue subsistence farming &quot;for the immediate future,&quot; while the government explores new avenues for economic growth. He mentioned the potential of agricultural innovations, including the utilization of irrigation methods that minimize water loss, to create jobs and boost farm output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma pledged to promote the development of industries, particularly those related to the minerals and crops already being produced in Namibia. And he called for the involvement of the local business community in the mining sector, which is in the hands of South African and British investors. He said the Namibian government regards the private sector as &quot;an engine for growth and prosperity&quot; and that it will remove laws which have limited business opportunities for black Namibians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are committed to a mixed economy,&quot; he said, and the government wants to enter joint ventures with the private sector to promote fishing, large-scale farming and agriculture-related industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he made no mention of the need for outside aid, Nujoma appealed for foreign investment to help boost employment. He said a new investment code will spell out an &quot;open and inviting&quot; attitude and set forth requirements for commitments by investors to national development goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a country that has had international backing, &quot;Namibia will play an active role in international affairs,&quot; the president said. The country will become the 160th member of the United Nations and the 52nd member to the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namibia may unintentionally have made its first major contribution in this sphere already, as leaders who travelled here for independence took advantage of the opportunity for diplomatic discussions on a wide range of subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One topic on the agenda of several of the officials was the fighting in Angola. By the end of the week of talks and exchanges, the prospects seemed good for agreement on a cease-fire between the Luanda government and the rebel movement Unita, led by Jonas Savimbi. Among the first meetings of the week was one between Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Secretary of State Baker, the first between such high-level American and Angolan officials since Angola's independence in 1975. The U.S. has never formally recognized the government in Luanda and is currently Unita's major military backer, supplying an estimated $ 50 million in covert assistance this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides characterized the session as productive, and dos Santos held subsequent meetings with de Klerk and several other leaders. The dos Santos/de Klerk session lasted 90 minutes instead of the scheduled 45, contributing to speculation that the two countries were close to concluding an agreement that might involve the establishment of trade missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparent thaw in relations comes only 15 months after South Africa withdrew its troops from Angola, ending a decade of South African invasions.  The peace accord between Angola, Cuba and South Africa also led to the agreement for implementing the Namibian independence process and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk was cheered when he opened his independence ceremony speech by saying: &quot;I stand here tonight as an advocate for peace. The season of violence has passed for Namibia and for the whole of southern Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State Baker also discussed Angola with Perez de Cuellar and with Soviet Foreign Minister Edward Shevardnaze, who visited Angola before arriving in Namibia. Assistant Secretary for Africa Herman Cohen, part of Baker's traveling party, held separate talks with the Angolan Defense Force chief, Gen. Franca Ndalu. Baker -- after traveling to Capetown and Johannesburg -- planned to wind-up his trip with a stop in Kinshasa, for meetings with Savimbi and President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, who is recognized as the accepted mediator by both sides in the Angolan conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomats from many countries believe conditions are favorable for a cease-fire that could prove longer lasting than last June's Gbadolite accord negotiated by Mobutu, which failed to stop the fighting. Since December, government forces have steadily penetrated the southeast of the country, as far as the town of Mavingo. Analysts see the advance as significant for two reasons: Unita forces have been pushed back further than ever before -- to within 200 miles of the Unita headquarters -- and the campaign was waged during the rainy season without the assistance of Cuban troops, who have pulled back to the north of the country in accordance with the 1988 tripartite agreement.  (Cuba has removed over 30,000 of the 50,000 soldiers previously stationed in Angola, but last week threatened retaliation against the guerrillas after blaming Unita for the ambush of a Cuban supply column that left one Cuban dead and six others wounded.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may be little more that Angolan government forces can achieve militarily, and the effort to hold current positions against Unita guerrilla assaults would likely be costly. So both sides may be unusually ready to settle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued fighting in Angola could present a serious problem for the new Namibian government as well. Angola served as Swapo's exile headquarters for more than a decade, and Swapo's guerrilla army fought alongside Angolan and Cuban troops in some of the most crucial battles against Unita and its South African backers. But it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Swapo government to make a continuing commitment to the war effort. The cost of helping the Angolan government would be hard for Namibia's strained budget to bear, and opposition parties would be sure to object vigorously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the current Angolan offensive against Unita is exacerbating the already tense situation in northern Namibia, where Namibians who served in the paramilitary South West African police are living in an uneasy truce with local civilians and former Swapo guerrillas. There have been numerous reports that Unita rebels fleeing the Angolan advance are responsible for widespread thefts and violence inside Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma, speaking on independence night, appealed for reconciliation among Namibians of all races and political views. He said Namibians' &quot;collective security and prosperity depend on our unity of purpose and action&quot; and that unity is needed to achieve peace -- in Namibia, and in the region as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the challenges the new government faces, the air of euphoria here may not be misplaced. Namibia produces minerals that other nations covet, including diamonds and uranium, and it exports furs, fish and beef. Its constitution is one of the most democratic in the world, with an unusual provision that commits the nation to helping the most disadvantaged of its citizens.  Unlike many newly-independent countries, its infrastructure is strong, its businesses are buoyant and its leaders are educated and experienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have also proved themselves as adept at diplomacy at home as they have been in exile. Prime Minister Hage Geingob, when he returned to run Swapo's election campaign, disarmed political rivals by inviting them round to his office for tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma himself, who was preceded by an image as a stern ideologue, has flashed his ready smile at friend and foe alike -- and told them all that the nation needs their energy and their skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than a million and a half people in a territory twice the size of California, Namibians are few in number. But this month at least, they are relishing their role as a model for the rest of us.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I stepped off the plane at Maputo airport and looked towards the airport building. The banner was gone. I was no longer welcomed to the zone of free humanity. In the days that followed my fifth arrival in Mozambique, I found myself reacting sharply to other scenes and changes as well.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the two years since my last visit, the deaths and fighting have continued unabated and the International Monetary Fund austerity program has begun to show its impact. Two years ago there were hardly any beggars; earlier there were none. Now there are many, both children and adults, in the market, in front of the stores and hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average salary for a middle-level civil servant is not enough for a family to survive without some other form of income -- a plot of land to grow food, a service to sell, or access to goods at work or elsewhere that can be sold or traded for necessities. Many a family goes hungry between salary checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the city has been spruced up. Because of the influx of donor organizations, the housing shortage in the old Portuguese section of the city is acute (as it is in the nearby shantytowns because of the influx of refugees from the countryside). There is hardly a decrepit structure to be seen, and the repairs go beyond paint and replaced roof tiles to artistic and tasteful renovations of some beautiful colonial houses. &quot;Why is Maputo such a well-kept secret?&quot; asked a visiting United Nations official. &quot;This is a little paradise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once sparsely-stocked market is packed with an array of fruits, vegetables, eggs and meat and the shop windows are filled with goods. But few Mozambicans can do more than windowshop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this backdrop, a speedy process of class formation is taking place, with some living well on aid contracts and associated opportunities while the urban and rural majority sink deeper into poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war is still the major reality, and a deep battle fatigue pervades the life of virtually every Mozambican. With health and agricultural facilities among those most disrupted by Renamo attacks, the toll, on both individuals and social structures, is staggering. Diseases are spreading, and nearly eight million Mozambicans are either totally or to a large extent dependent on food aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is little wonder that news of the prospect of negotiations have been greeted with such relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After their meeting in Washington, D.C. this month, President George Bush commended Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano for &quot;taking steps towards democracy parallel with steps toward economic reform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, as part of an effort to make the political process more accessible to ordinary citizens, Chissano introduced a new draft constitution for public debate. The proposed document provides for direct presidential elections, limits terms of office, and guarantees a broad range of human rights, including freedom of religion and the right to strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Mozambique is implementing an economic austerity plan, backed by the International Monetary Fund, which has spawned a wave of strikes and protests across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the White House, views on the political and economic changes in Mozambique are more ambivalent than those expressed by President Bush. The Canadian publication Southern Africa Report has devoted portions of recent issues to a round- table debate on the implications of the changes in Mozambique. Last month, Agneta Lind and Anton Johnston -- former aid workers from Sweden and Britain -- wrote of their doubts about the effectiveness of economic reforms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the introduction of structural adjustment policies in 1987,&quot; they said, Mozambique's deficit has risen -- by 45% since 1988 -- and the country has become increasingly dependent on foreign assistance. Aid, they wrote, &quot;is often overvalued by the donor,&quot; and a large proportion is used to purchase goods and consulting services and to support aid bureaucracies in the donor countries. Lind and Johnston also worry that aid money encourages corruption and conspicuous consumption among a Mozambican elite. And they are concerned that the government's move away from socialist policies might signal a waning commitment to economic justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers who have spent time in Mozambique tend to argue that the country has always had a large measure of democratic debate. And the process would have evolved further, they say, except for a 13-year war with the Renamo rebel group that has killed 100,000 people, created a million refugees, and threatens five million with starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long-time supporters of Mozambique argue, for example, that the abolition of the death penalty in the new constitution is a return to long-held values of the ruling Frelimo party. At its independence in 1975, Mozambique became one of a handful of countries to abolish the death penalty, but reintroduced it in 1979, amid growing atrocities by Renamo. In practice, however, the death penalty has been unused for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration remains convinced that the economic reform package will bring results. The Mozambique government's moves &quot;to open up the economy to market forces&quot; are directly related to economic development, Bush told Chissano during their meeting. Officials of international financial institutions are hopeful as well. James Edgerly of the Arthur D. Little consulting firm, who has just completed a year's work on Mozambique for the World Bank, says the country's potential in agriculture, fisheries, tourism and mining could make it a wealthy country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, it is one of the poorest and most miserable -- and will remain so, everyone agrees, until the war ends. For several months, Mozambican church officials, along with the leaders of Kenya and Zimbabwe, have tried unsuccessfully to organize peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest stumbling block was Renamo's insistence that Frelimo negotiate not as a government but as a political party, a condition Mozambique dismissed as unrealistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lately, though, Renamo's position appears to be softening. And observers speculate that a recent series of grisly attacks, including one on Feb. 4 that killed nearly eighty Mozambicans on a train, might be Renamo's way of showing its strength before talks begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa News asked Jose Oscar Monteiro, minister of state in the Mozambican president's office, about the current situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: How much does the draft constitution represent a real change in direction, and how much are there threads in the proposed changes that go back to the founding of Frelimo, and are part of long-standing principles?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monteiro: There is both the factor of an evolution of the internal process of democracy and the factor of change. I would say that Frelimo has had a basic commitment to free and open discussion. What does this mean? It means discussing everything with the population, trying to popularize the decisions, and having the feeling of what were the sentiments of the population about any given problem. This is linked to the very intense popular participation that marked the development of Frelimo before independence, and immediately after independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The distinctive mark of Frelimo's action -- more than political principle or completely defined political ideology -- was this popular participation. And I think what we realize now is that we have many more educated people -- 15 years make a big difference, although far from what is needed-- and with the development of society in general, it's normal that people begin having different ways of thinking about problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the beginning it was much easier to reach a consensus; now it takes longer. Therefore, it's an internal need -- the evolution of the society requires more democratization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll give you an example. In the preparation of the party congresses, for a certain period, discussions were held at the level of the party. But the questions relating to the last party congress were discussed by the common citizens in the various neighborhoods. So as the society is changing, there is in fact a transformation. This evolution requires changes. Some are more visible than others; when you make changes in a document like the constitution, it is more dramatic, and calls your attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would say that we remain committed to the objectives of providing always a greater civic participation in the development of the country. Are there changes in the economic policy? Definitely, yes. We have been drawing, not only now, but since '82, '83, the lessons of our experiences. We think now that much more role must be given to the family sector in agriculture. This was said in the past, but in practical terms, we did not manage to do what we were saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Why not?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monteiro: One of the reasons was that the Portuguese network that formed the family sector was disrupted &cent;when Portuguese settlers fled at independence/ and we had to take over, without experience. At the same time, the state had to take over big agricultural estates, and all the resources of the state went to these projects. Of course, if you see it in the global picture, it does not represent much. There was not really global collectivization or anything like this -- but even in the limited scale, it was draining all the resources. The trend in our state machinery, in the sector of agriculture, was to concentrate every effort in these sectors. The idea was that at least these sectors could provide the basic solutions to the problems of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a principle it's not wrong; certain basic things we have to be sure to secure. But finally we realized that a huge state conglomerate does not mean really that it works better, that it is more sensitive to the needs of the people. The state shops &cent;a system of government-owned stores/ came as a result of shops that were abandoned &cent;by the Portuguese/, but at some point we thought that this was a good system. Then we realized, no, this is not the way; the capacities of the state are limited, and the citizen can do much more. I think the society becomes more flexible, and more free. And the state instead can concentrate on what it must do, for instance, to guarantee education -- this is by itself, in my opinion, the most important task for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What are the most important of the proposed constitutional changes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monteiro: Elections will be direct, by universal suffrage, direct and secret ballot at every level, and will no longer be linked to the structures of the party. There will be a limitation of terms of office for the president. I think this is very important, because it is one very concrete way of showing to the people that those who are in a position of command are not there for life.  They are there because they have the trust of people, they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are the servants, the representatives of those who have elected them.  So this is the first principle of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second one is the guarantee of individual rights, where we expect the judiciary to play a more important role than in the past. We have a very young judiciary branch, we don't have many lawyers, but we feel that we have the basis upon which to build an independent judiciary that will guarantee these rights of the citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: These changes are taking place in the midst of a great conflict. Why do you think you can afford to do such things as abolish the death penalty now, when it was first instituted because of the attacks by Renamo?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monteiro: Well, I would say that the death penalty, when we introduced it, was a kind of threat against potential violators. As a threat it might or might not have a certain effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the extent of the attacks made it difficult to use this penalty, which would be excessive, if applied to the hundreds of people who have been committing crimes. We realize these people were mostly led to commit crimes because they were abducted, coerced. I have myself spoken with many of these people who have been &cent;kidnapped/ -- very young people 10, 12, 16 years old.  Therefore, we think that the purpose of such a penalty would not be served by using it. That's the reason why this penalty was abolished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practical terms, I must say that for years the penalty has not been used. What we are doing in the proposed draft of the constitution is to recognize some things that we have been doing already for some years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Some of your critics say the Mozambican government is standing in the way of peace talks by rejecting Renamo's demand that you come to negotiations, not as a government, but as a political party and without any preconditions. How do you see the prospects for peace -- and the obstacles?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monteiro: There are different obstacles. First I think that we should do our utmost to advance in this process because the destruction is too big.  The second thing is that whether you like the government or not, the government is in place; we cannot go back to the times of the Portuguese and discuss about a new state. But there are many things that can be discussed. You see that the proposal of the constitution is not yet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">approved and is open for discussion. Therefore, we have said that Renamo people could come and participate in the discussion of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we say we want to know what we are going to discuss, that is because certain things have to be accepted, not just by the government but by the people. We don't believe that we should make &cent;fundamental/ changes without consulting the population, which has fought for this freedom we have. I think the country should not be held at ransom to make changes, just because some people by force are imposing them. So the changes that must come, including the changes in the constitution, should be accepted by all of the population.  Renamo are a group of people, they are Mozambicans -- despite the type of actions they use, yes, we accept it, and we accept that they should participate in the process. But they cannot impose their will on the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What is it that Renamo wants to put on the agenda for talks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monteiro: Actually, we have been trying to know what they want. We say that they can come, openly, and in the process of discussing the constitution, and later on in the process of elections, they can make their own proposals.  For instance, if they want a multi-party state, this is a question that -- as you have seen in the constitution -- is not mentioned. It is a problem that we decided to put to popular discussion, because it's an important change, and we have to take into account the political culture of the country, the way people have been thinking, and the need for the people to assess the different positions and take a stand. Even if many people might think that one of the systems has more democracy than the other -- even something which is more &quot;democratic&quot; should not be imposed in an undemocratic way! Because then, again, we will have resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: How is Renamo sustained?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monteiro: I think they still get forces supporting them outside of the country. Renamo was founded in 1976 by the white government in what was then Rhodesia.  When Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe, Renamo's base of support shifted to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December, President de Klerk was in Mozambique, and he was asked by the journalists, &quot;What about South African support?&quot; He said the following: &quot;Well, I have given instructions to the official bodies linked to the state to stop every kind of support. But I cannot guarantee that there are not private interests doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is that &cent;supporting Renamo/ was transferred from an official operation into a private operation, in order to leave the government out of the action. Now what is important is to track down the people who are using their positions, their means, their airplanes, to continue providing support. And we know, and everybody knows, that this is going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Different types of support continue to pour in and enable Renamo to continue thinking that they should go on fighting. I think this encouragement -- it's more the encouragement that they are getting -- is really hardening their position. I think they should accept the very open conditions that are laid down now, which is basically no conditions. And this suffering and pillaging and raping people and using young people and trans-forming their minds and provoking constant movement of the population and therefore hunger and malnutrition with what it entails for the future generations -- must stop very quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What, from your point of view, is behind Renamo's actions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monteiro: You have to look into the history of Renamo. It began as a destabilizing factor -- sheer destruction. The objective was to destroy a government. This government had a popular base, for historical reasons, including the fact that Frelimo is the movement that started the victorious war of independence. We took many measures that were in the interest of the people. With the generosity that was typical of this period, we were distributing everything that we could in what we thought was the most just manner. So the way to destroy this base of popular support was not to mobilize support against Frelimo, but to terrorize people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was governor in a province, the province of Gaza, and for some months I was baffled with the kind of actions that the bandits were doing. I said, if they want to mobilize the population, why do they act this way? Only later I realized that you can rule a certain number of people through terror.  Not for a long time -- but people accept terror. Experience all over the world, not only Mozambique, shows that. What was done in Mozambique was to use this experience in a very cruel and open manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was planned a year and a half ago. But last month's conference on Popular Participation in Development, held in Arusha, Tanzania, coincided with a worldwide wave of democratic fervor that gave the gathering an added sense of urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For us in Africa,&quot; said Adebayo Adedeji, who heads the United Nations-sponsored Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), &quot;popular participation is not a mere slogan. It is a matter of life and death.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convened by the ECA along with a host of non-governmental organizations, the meeting attracted 500 participants, many from grassroots groups such as trade unions, youth and women's organizations -- constituencies whose views were evident in the final conference declaration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emphasis on people power was visible in the seating arrangements at Arusha's international conference center. After passing through an entrance hall crowded with booths displaying homemade wares and locally-based technologies, governmental and UN representatives were directed to seats in the wings, while delegates from non-governmental organizations were placed front and center under a huge banner that read: &quot;The People.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next five days, participants discussed Africa's development crisis in overtly political terms. The delegates &quot;explicitly identified the lack of participatory processes as the primary cause of Africa's unyielding, decade-long economic catastrophe,&quot; says Salim Lone, editor of the UN publication Africa Recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People kept referring to events in Eastern Europe,&quot; says Carol Capps of Church World Service, an ecumenical relief and development agency.  &quot;The feeling was, if those entrenched governments can change, why can't African governments?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference adopted a 13-page charter that says African governments must &quot;yield space to the people.&quot; But recognizing the reluctance of governments everywhere to cede power voluntarily, the charter calls on African people themselves to press for democracy and &quot;to establish independent people's organizations that are genuinely grassroots, democratically administered and self-reliant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think one result of this,&quot; Capps predicts, &quot;will be that non-governmental organizations in Africa will increase both in number and strength.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conference participants recognized that such a course would not be easy. Mazide N'Diaye, president of an umbrella network of voluntary development organizations known as FAVDO (Forum for African Voluntary Development Organizations), said that non-governmental organizations have learned that most African countries leave little room for people's initiatives. But it is increasingly evident that African governments cannot meet the needs of their people, N'Diaye said, so people must organize themselves to fill the gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflecting the prominence of discussions about the role of women, the charter says that the attainment of equal social, economic and political rights for women must be a central feature of democratic and participatory development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth Engo-Tgeja, a conference organizer who works with Unifem, the UN agency for women's affairs, said that women's issues must be viewed in a new way. In the past, she said, such priorities as water pumps and day care centers were seen as matters of women's rights. &quot;The more we think about these issues,&quot; she said, &quot;the more we believe getting water for the community is not a woman's right. It is a community right . . . &cent;Day care/ should be a mainstream problem and not a women's problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having women in decision-making structures, Engo-Tgeja said, insures a responsiveness to important community concerns. She pointed to the Arusha meeting as a case study of that process. Women on the conference coordinating committee, she said, &quot;were able to bring out issues that could not be perceived by our male colleagues&quot; -- issues that were later adopted as part of the charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference theme of popular participation ensured that the question of democracy would be firmly linked to the debate on economic development issues. Hassan Sunmonu, Secretary-General of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, said that structural adjustment programs (SAPs) have been imposed -- by international institutions and by African governments -- without the agreement of Africa's people. Although economic reforms are needed, Sunmonu said, the SAPs that have been mandated by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank haven't worked, because they put the heaviest burdens on the poorest citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conference delegates generally appeared to share Sunmonu's view that the economic growth rates and increased exports advocated by SAPs have done little to achieve the goal of alleviating poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor unions have played a brave role in exposing the myth of SAPs, Sunmonu said, but governments have responded with arrests and repression. &quot;Our members have paid the price for telling the truth,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arusha conference charter condemns the suppression of dissent. It defends the right to strike and calls for a halt to widespread bans on youth and student organizations and the &quot;arbitrary&quot; closure of educational institutions. It cited ten indicators of popular participation, including media freedom, protection of the environment and flourishing grassroots movements.  The charter also carries a warning to unrepresentative governments, noting that &quot;the forces of freedom and democracy are contagious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a few delegates expressed uneasiness at the reception they might receive upon returning home. But the response of a Tanzanian government representative, who said the host country would not only endorse the charter but would seek ways to implement it, ended the meeting on a note of cheer. It was left to the ECA's Adedeji to issue a challenge to the delegates themselves. &quot;No one else will solve our problems for us,&quot; he told the group. &quot;Achieving a turnaround in our society is our primary responsibility. Let us show the increasingly skeptical world that we can make it and that we are determined to make it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">A SEASON OF DISCONTENT</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">679 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Laurent Ghagbo, an opposition leader in Cote d'Ivoire, was scheduled to go to Paris this month to appear on a live television program about pro-democracy movements in Africa. But the French Embassy denied him a visa. And the Ivorian government cooperated by placing him under house arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the restrictions lasted less than a day, the incident typifies the sensitivity of African governments -- and their Western backers -- to a growing surge of popular pressure for political reforms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In neighboring Benin, a national movement of workers and civil servants has forced Brigadier General Mathieu Kerekou to accept an entirely new Cabinet and a new prime minister and to free all political prisoners. Although Kerekou remains head of state, he has agreed to call a national conference to draw up a new democratic constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military leader of Niger, Ali Saibou, has also had to yield to protests, in this case from students who forced him to sack four Cabinet members regarded as taking a hard line against demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabon, too, is responding to pressures for change. Earlier this month, the national assembly began discussing political reforms that it says will lead to elections within six months. The debate followed weeks of strikes and protests that led President Omar Bongo to dissolve the ruling Democratic Party on February 23. By mid-March, the embattled leader had promised to come up with pay raises for Gabonese workers by the end of the month -- a pledge he may have trouble keeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Africa's northern tier, Moroccan dissidents have been emboldened by political reforms in Tunisia and in next-door Algeria, where strikes and demonstrations have become a daily affair. As in other African countries, economic crisis has fueled the demands for democratic reforms that are coming from across the political spectrum. &quot;The current economic dead end reflects the dead end of democracy in Morocco,&quot; said the Al Alam newspaper, an organ of the rightist Istiqlal party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After five years of internationally-mandated austerity programs, Morocco's economy has not improved. Last year its trade deficit doubled, and citizens are bracing for a new round of price hikes and wage cuts. In oil-rich Gabon, a sharp drop in buying power spurred the protests. President Bongo blamed the problem on restrictions imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Explosions will be hard to avoid,&quot; warns the French magazine Jeune Afrique. &quot;African leaders multiply their SOS calls in the direction of Western countries. But the appeals are forwarded to the IMF and the World Bank who tighten the screws more and more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the unrest, as in Cote d'Ivoire, where students and civil servants have been engaged in running battles with the police, has been violent. In Kenya, students and police tangled at the funeral of murdered foreign minister Robert Ouko. Their calls for government accountability have coincided with increasingly outspoken appeals for greater democracy from human rights advocates, especially church leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Ethiopia to Mozambique to Benin, a move away from explicit Marxist policies has been part of the pattern. That trend has encouraged analysts in Western governments, who believe that free market economies are the key to easing Africa's development crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African economists are not so quick to agree. Multi-party democracy doesn't have to mean embracing capitalism, many say, especially on a continent where investment capital is scarce or non-existent. Both governments and protesters are vigorously questioning the impact of the economic reforms that were designed to pull Africa's economies out of their downhill slide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems facing Africa are daunting and the proposed solutions numerous. But more and more, Africans are insisting that recovery is impossible without greater democracy. In this and future issues, Africa News will examine the winds of change sweeping Africa and the response of the outside powers who still, to a great extent, influence Africa's destiny.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the jubilant independence celebrations in Namibia to the quiet end of one-party rule in Benin, a wave of democratic sentiment is sweeping across Africa. Virtually ignored by the outside world, African students, professionals, trade unionists and clerics are pressing for a greater say in their countries' affairs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A coalition of South African labor and environmental groups in cooperation with Greenpeace in the United States has won an apparent victory in a campaign against a U.S. company which ships toxic waste to South Africa. Mercury waste from the British firm Thor Chemicals in Natal has polluted the Mngeweni River, used by the local people for washing and drinking.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups also say that workers exposed to the toxins in the Thor plant have become ill with mercury poisoning. American Cyanamid has been exporting over ten tons of the used chemicals a year to the waste recycling company. The campaign included protests at the South African plant and at Cyanamid's New Jersey headquarters, a Cyanamid shareholdes' meeting, and at one of its chemical plants. Amid the public outcry over the waste trade, the South African government shut down the Thor plant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Continuing strife in the Horn of Africa has once again plunged large parts of Ethiopia and Sudan into crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ethiopia, an estimated five million people are currently at risk of starvation, as the fighting continues between government forces and two major insurgent armies. In neighboring Sudan, four and a half million people are directly affected by the on-going conflict between the military government of General Omar Al-Bashir and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the wars have attracted little international attention, the seriousness of the situation has prompted international pressure on the governments of Ethiopia and Sudan and on the rebel forces in each country. But experts believe there may not be sufficient pressure or enough time to avert wide-scale famine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Congressional hearings earlier this year attempted to draw U.S.  attention to the crisis. In his testimony Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Herman Cohen called for increased donations, a negotiated free passage of food and international airlifts in government and rebel-held areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Cohen, the Ethiopian conflict may be the largest in the world today in terms of combatants, as well as the most destructive. The Joint Relief Partnership, a coalition of church agencies plus the government relief organ, is distributing food to government-held territories and to areas controlled by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) -- a rebel force fighting to overthrow the present Ethiopian regime. While the joint effort signifies a step toward government/rebel cooperation, it falls short of the estimated 635,000 metric tons of relief needed. However, no similar effort has been mounted in the northern area of Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conflict has intensified in that region, where the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) has been fighting for independence from Ethiopia for three decades. Throughout this month, the government forces of President Mengistu Haile Mariam have been attacking Massawa, the port town captured by the EPLF in February. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has said that without the use of Massawa for major relief efforts, mass starvation cannot be avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the EPLF has said it would allow the port to be a staging area for relief flights, Ethiopian officials want airlifts to be flown into Asmara, a government-held town. But, according to U.S. Congressional sources, a stockpile of undistributed food already exists there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the only effective means of getting food to the rebel-held territories in Eritrea, where over 75% of the famine victims are located, is through cross-border efforts from Sudan. The relief arm of the EPLF is now working at capacity but lacks an adequate supply of trucks, personnel and food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A peaceful settlement between the ruling Workers Party of Ethiopia and the EPLF and other warring factions has thus far been illusive. Negotiations over Eritrea, under the mediation of former President Jimmy Carter, stalled last December on the issue of United Nations participation. As a UN member state, Ethiopia would have to invite the world body to the talks before it would agree to attend. The EPLF has asked the UN to be one of the observers, but Ethiopia refuses to concur. Dayle Powell, the director of the Conflict Resolution Program at the Carter Center in Atlanta, says that the Ethiopian government has agreed to begin substantive peace talks, but that the EPLF will only discuss the relief issue and the UN matter. Because the two sides are so distant, according to Powell, Carter has concluded that talks right now would serve no useful purpose. Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere has agreed to co-chair with President Carter any further peace efforts, a development which even some Ethiopian government critics say may enhance the possibilities for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers see President Mengistu's hold on power as threatened by several factors, including the recent rebel military gains, a disgruntled Ethiopian army which led an unsuccessful coup attempt last May and whose members are tiring of years of forced conscription and poor treatment, and a drop in economic assistance from long-time supporters East Germany and the Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, the President unveiled an economic reform package which allows for private investment, private enterprise and private property. Some Western analysts herald the changes as a major step toward economic liberalization. Others, noting that the program does not mention a reduction in military expenditures, believed to be over 60% of the budget, warn that the announcement may be only a scheme to ensure support from the international donors. A high-level Ethiopian dele-gation, led by foreign policy chief, Kesse Kedebe, visited Washington last month to garner economic sup-port from the U.S., the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The delegation included advisors from the Israeli government, now one of Ethiopia's strongest supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Sudan, international efforts to force the government and the SPLA into an agreement on relief efforts have succeeded. In early April, Operation Lifeline began airlifts into the country's war-torn southern region. Operation Lifeline Sudan, created to assist the nearly 3.5 million displaced persons in the conflict areas, is back in action. About a hundred metric tons of food a day is being airlifted into the southern town of Juba. The needs are great and time will be a crucial factor in the effort's success. The rainy season begins next month, making travel throughout much of the region impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although military offensives in Juba have subsided, fighting continues, and heavy casualties have been reported on both sides. Many civilians are still being forced to flee their homes in search of food and safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peace negotiations between the SPLA and the ruling Revolutionary Command Council, held in Nairobi last December and hosted by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi were unsuccessful. More recently, Zairean President Mobutu Seso Seko has agreed to try his hand at mediating the conflict. And according to one State Department official, the U.S. is actively working behind the scenes to seek an end to the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Winter, head of the U.S. Committee for Refugees, recently returned from Sudan and is less optimistic. He believes that despite its call for peace, the Sudanese government is actually taking steps that will widen the gulf between it and the SPLA. And Winter says that rebel forces, while agreeing to negotiations, feel that talks would be unproductive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since taking over the country in a coup last June, President Al Bashir has been moving his country closer to the fundamentalist positions that the largely-Christian rebel forces have been resisting. Bashir's main internal support comes from the National Islamic Front, a radical fundamentalist party.  Iran, Iraq and Libya have increased their military support for Sudan. Sharia, or Islamic law, was instated last December. And last month, the government announced its plan to eventually unite with Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the governments' human rights record has come under fire.  The U.S.-based Africa Watch recently published a report condemning the Sudanese government for alleged use of torture and imprisonment without trial as well as for a lack of attention to the plight of its starving population. Africa Watch calls the famine situation in Sudan &quot;an entirely manmade disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the Sudanese government reported an attempted take-over by retired army officials, but it appears that Bashir remains firmly in control.  To discourage further in-surrection, the president ordered the execution of 28 officers involved in the coup attempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was 'vintage Mobutu' last week, as one of Africa's longest-serving autocrats yielded to increasing pressures and announced an end to one-party rule. Although Mobutu Sese Seko has held power in Zaire for 25 years by using a deft combination of strong-arm and persuasive political tactics, this latest action is probably his boldest and riskiest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu, who seized power in a 1965 coup backed by the CIA, announced he would step down as head of the ruling party, and he named a new prime minister to head the government. But he made clear he was not forfeiting ultimate political authority. &quot;My role will certainly not be to cut the blue ribbon for bridges and roads,&quot; he told a press conference following his nationally-broadcast address on April 24. He said he would be &quot;above party politics&quot; and &quot;the arbiter, or better still, the last recourse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president also announced an end to a ban on Western-style dress, which has required Zairean men to wear high collar jackets similar to those worn by Chinese rulers. But he said he was retaining the prohibition on use of &quot;Christian&quot; names, saying the employment of &quot;authentic Zairean names is an inestimable cultural acquisition that cannot be put into question.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three political parties will be legalized initially, Mobutu said. The ruling Popular Movement for the Revolution, which all Zaireans have been required to join, will be one of them, along with the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) and a third as-yet unnamed group. He also said UDPS leader Tshisekedi wa Mulumba would be freed from house arrest and allowed to participate along with other opponents in campaigning for elections next April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's about-face comes at a time of growing international and domestic criticism of his regime. Last year, the Zaire leader attained a measure of immunity from attack when he emerged as the accepted mediator between the government of neighboring Angola and the Angolan rebel movement Unita, led by Jonas Savimbi. But Mobutu's failure to bring the two sides together has eroded that status. Last month, two of his prominent Congressional critics, Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-NY) and Howard Wolpe (D-MI) issued stinging denunciations of the Zaire leader's record and called for an end to all U.S.  military aid and a requirement that all economic assistance be channeled through non-governmental organizations. Zaire is currently the largest American aid recipient in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu is widely reported to have amassed a huge fortune -- estimated at as much as $ 5 billion -- at least in part by siphoning off government revenues and aid funds from Western donors. The Zaire leader &quot;certainly should be able to make up any shortfall&quot; in U.S. aid money just from the interest on his wealth, Solarz said in Congressional testimony earlier this month.  &quot;Credible reports of corruption and misuse of aid abound, and make a mockery of U.S. efforts to transfer aid through the Zairean bureaucracy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank has suspended disbursement of funds to Zaire in a dispute with the government over the level of presidential spending, the Wall Street Journal reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At home, Mobutu has also run into an unusual outpouring of complaints.  After announcing a &quot;national dialogue&quot; earlier this year to solicit the opinions of Zaireans throughout the country, Mobutu was deluged with written critiques of the nation's problems and his own performance. Although the government has not released the submissions, many have circulated privately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unusually-critical statement was issued by the conference of Roman Catholic bishops, calling for major changes in the government and in Zaire society. A part of the clerics' ire is directed at the international financial institutions -- the World Bank and International Monetary Fund -- as well as at Western governments which have been insisting on repayment of Zaire's $ 7.4 billion foreign debt. The borrowed funds benefited only a privileged, corrupt few, the bishops say, and they charge that the international lenders sanctioned the diversions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following excerpts from the bishops' statement were translated from the document as published by the Paris-based weekly Jeune Afrique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We, the members of the permanent committee of the bishops of Zaire gathered in an extraordinary session in accordance with the mandate received by the Bishopric Assembly, want, in the name of the latter and in virtue of our pastoral responsibilities, to join our voices with the voices of all the sons and daughters of Zaire, to put forth the contribution of the Catholic Church to the public debate on the functioning of national institutions and the general situation of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other places, decisive events and essential reforms have shaken the geopolitical balance and toppled governmental systems, particularly in Eastern Europe and certain African nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These substantial reforms force us to question ourselves, not only because of the fall into world disrepute, but mainly because the present political system in our country has borrowed a number of concepts, structures and practices from Eastern European countries who have now abandoned them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are the reasons why a public debate is a necessary national step, so that all the institutions in charge of governing the state and managing the public good are subjected to an evaluation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such an evaluation is definitely called for since the Second Republic has just entered its twenty-fifth year of existence. Also, we rejoice at the courageous call by the head of state to all sons and daughters of Zaire, asking that, through critiques, suggestions, and constructive propositions, they each contribute to the search for the path to happiness, for integral development, and for the prosperity to which the whole population aspires. Our conscience as priests compells us to take part in this national debate, because these stakes are of prime importance to the future of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the situation in our country, and after rereading the universal teachings of the church and of our own interior directives, we reaffirm that the principal cause -- if not the root -- of paralysis in our national institutions and the structural crisis of the state resides in the hybrid political system. This system gives us &quot;liberalism,&quot; offers the advantages to a small minority of owning private property, and at the same time borrows from &quot;totalitarianism&quot; the methods of conquering and of maintaining power.  Zaire has inherited the weaknesses of both systems, from which has arisen a system of absolute and autocratic power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the growing ambiguities and incoherences of our hybrid political system we find the institutionalization of the Popular Movement for the Revolution, transformed into party/state four years later. This can only have the effect of an expensive and useless duplication of governmental structures as well as the managing of a political party by the state. In addition, we question whether this party is really a party, since all Zaireans are forced to be members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this hybrid system, the presidential regime, as it is organized in our country, gives the head of state responsibility for the actions of the party and for the executive powers of government.  Such an organization inevitably leads to political monism and a concentration of power that leaves little place for the responsibility of alternative authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This regime risks inhibiting, if not eliminating altogether the freedom to criticize the functioning of institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In such a system, public criticism of institutions made by the head of state and his collaborators is hardly convincing. The criticism gives the impression of the relinquishment of power or of a confession without consequences. In this way, the head of state is placed in a very uncomfortable situation, because -- being both the judge and the party -- he cannot sanction the faults of his subordinates, although they present themselves as his advisors or the executor of his orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why we believe in the necessity of distinguishing the three powers: the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. Furthermore, we think that in a presidential regime, democracy cannot be guaranteed unless the people exercising public functions are truly accountable, and unless the law provides for a structure of checks and balances of the executive by an entity representing the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Bank and its various institutions obey political imperatives, and function as the cashier of the party/state. They are at the disposition of certain people, particularly the authorities of the country, who each take what they want as they wish. In addition, the national budget is quantitatively insignificant, under-estimated in revenues, unequally spread in spending, submitted to arbitrary deductions, managed at whim and without reference to a comprehensive financial law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The functioning of our institutions as described above, is well known and is encouraged by Zaire's foreign partners.  In fact, they know those with whom they have signed contracts very well and they know where the money they have credited to Zaire lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, therefore, abnormal and unjust that those who have established this financial system -- which diverts capital to those who use it to their own advantage, then lend it with interest to the rightful recipients -- demand, in return, budgetary restrictions that bring extreme poverty to populations forced to submit to the weight of debts they did not incur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people are, therefore, double victims of the international money-lender system, sustained by countries who proclaim themselves promoters of social justice and human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The considerations put forth show that our country is at a crossroad.  We are either engaged in a path of deep reform of the system and the political institutions of the state, or we have condemned our country to suffer even greater pains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, the reforms of the political system must be designed to promote the true cultural values of our people; to safeguard national unity, national integrity, and the peace acquired at great expense; to guarantee the fundamental rights and liberties inherent in human dignity; to assure the participation of everyone, not only to exploit the riches, but to reap the fruit of common effort; and to build an economy that functions for the profit of the nation rather than to serve small-group and outside interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond fundamental political reforms needed to address the difficulties, ambiguities and inadequacies of the ruling Popular Movement for the Revolution, the presidential system and the managing of public finances, we want to stress the necessity of a new constitution that would be developed through a national debate involving the entire nation. This new constitution would be the expression of a national consensus and would apply to all Zaireans without exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context of fundamental reform, we believe it is an opportune time to suggest changes and establish priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* It should be unequivocably recognized that the party is not the nation, and that political organizations have to be distinct from the people, and judged and accepted by the people. It is imperative that the party renounce its leading role over the people and put an end to the useless duplication of the institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All Zaireans should enjoy a stable constitution and national laws that will be passed or modified only if the whole nation profits. Procedures established by the law must be respected, and the laws themselves should be ethical and conform to the aspirations of the Zairean people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All legal measures should be taken to avoid a situation where a minority or a group of citizens can gain power and impose it on the nation for their own profit. All citizens who are competent to do so have the right to participate without discrimination in the management of public affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All those who exercise public power should stop complaining about what is going wrong in their jurisdiction. On the contrary, they should fulfill their responsibilities, punish the guilty and reward good and loyal citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* We have to avoid undermining the exercise of authority by giving responsibility to people who are incapable or dishonest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All national agencies, at whatever level, should answer to a hierarchical authority that is able to take necessary actions.  In particular, governmental bodies should be responsible not only to the head of state but also to an agency representing the people that is empowered to rectify deficiencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Freedom of speech, recognized and guaranteed by the constitution, must become effective, because it is indispensable for the exercise of fundamental liberties as well as for the integral and harmonious development of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The managers of institutions and public finances must obey specific and established laws.  In particular, no politician, state functionary or private group can substitute for the Zairean people and manage public funds as though they were personal inheritances. All abuses and infractions in this domain must be severely penalized by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To contribute to solving the problem of national debt, we must encourage foreign investors but also utilize our own financial resources. It is imperative that the flight of capital be stopped, and that Zaireans reinvest that capital in their own country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* One of the primary obligations of the political authorities of any country is to guarantee access to medical care and a quality education to all citizens. This demands the rehabilitation of teaching and medical facilities.  Also, it is urgent that we study the ways to improve the social security system, analyze the politics of salaries and stabilize the national currency.  Experience already shows that in places far from commercial centers and rarely supervised by superior authorities, the cases of administrative abuses multiply. To better protect the population, it is necessary to pay all functionaries of the state and military personnel adequately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* For these types of reforms to suc-ceed, each son and daughter of Zaire must possess a great patriotic spirit, strong loyalties, and a true love for the fatherland and its integral development. To this end, it is necessary that the education given to individuals and communities concentrate on honesty and the distinction between personal and communal good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our country's suffering is explained by inadequate structures and systems that favor the crumbling of morals and the other evils that we deplore. Faced with this situation, we are tempted to believe that only the change of structures and systems will give us moral help and material prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This change is, of course, necessary, but what is even more important is the conservation and the renewal of the heart and spirit of the sons and daughters of Zaire, because it is from the heart and spirit of men and women that spring the desires and aspirations that inspire the economic and political systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social and moral environment in which we live has, in a way, contaminated us all. The renewal of Zaire and the necessary changes demand that we become new people. This is why it is necessary to support the actions of moral people, notably the church, who try to mold consciences and incite people to pursue transcendent values.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">VICE PRESIDENT: OUR SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1571 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: How would you rate Kenya's economic performance -- are you satisfied that government policies are working?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: For the last five years Kenya's economic growth rate has averaged not less than five percent. Indeed, per capita income in Kenya has also been growing positively. This is within a continent where the per capita income for a number of years in Africa actually has been negative. I think there are very few countries in Africa with a positive growth rate, so that is a major success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even more important is that Kenya has been able to feed its own people and has also been able to record surpluses for a number of years, save for the times of very serious droughts. We do have our problems and we do have our challenges. We are sparing no effort in facing up to the challenges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: To what do you attribute your success?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: I have always taken the view that not much economic growth can take place in an atmosphere of political strife. We have had good pragmatic leadership; our president is a very far-sighted person and a person committed to the development of the country. And he has provided political stability. I have no doubt at all that without political stability we would not have been able to achieve what we have achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: There's been concern expressed by African leaders and other people interested in Africa that the developments in Eastern Europe will take attention away from Africa; that investment and aid money will flow to Eastern Europe, to the detriment of Africa. In an interview we just published, U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said that one-party African governments can expect to have difficulty in getting attention and assistance from the United States and other parts of the West. Your government is committed to a one-party system. Are you under pressure to change this system?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: I just had a meeting with the new U.S. Agency for International Development administrator, and he was very explicit in his assurance that it's not the intention of the American government to shift various sources from Africa to Eastern Europe. A similar statement has been made by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. We have received similar assurances from France and from quite a number of other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But having said that we have heard parallels being drawn between Eastern Europe and Africa because the Eastern European countries have all had one-party systems, which have collapsed, and they now are having elections and multi-party structures. I think that is putting things in the wrong perspective. One must go back to history. The one-party system came to Europe immediately after the Second World War along with communism, imposed by Stalin. The people of the European countries were never consulted. The one-party system did not reflect the aspirations of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the one-party systems in African countries, where they do exist, came about as a result of the people's wish. People formed those parties as nationalist movements, movements which reflected the aspirations of the people, movements which were directed at the total emancipation of the people from colonialism. If you take the case of Kenya, we had more than one party. And during the time when there were these several parties -- there were more than two, finally they developed to only two parties -- each party was just a grouping of certain tribes. And during that time there was a lot of violence of a tribal nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the people themselves who then decided that the two party system did not serve their interests, especially from the point of view of uniting the country. And unity is so vital for the development of our country. So the party we have in Kenya is a party which has evolved as a result of the wishes of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We say the advocates of the multi-party system do not understand the situation in Africa properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Critics say that in Kenya there has been an erosion of democratic protections, of human rights, of the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: Let me tell you our own party -- Kanu -- although a single party, allows for a very great deal of debate within it, and this is true even during the elections. Our elections are very, very, very heated elections even at the party level. So, we feel that allowing people to talk the way they want in matters which they feel strongly about is provided for within the party. And within our own parliament, you will find that our debates are very lively. The government ministers are very much taken to task -- even myself as the vice president -- I've got to defend the various questions that are put forth to me by the parliamentarians. I myself, would wonder whether you have visited another country where debate is as openly carried out as it is in Kenya. Even in the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What about a free press?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: We do have a free press. The press does not have to say what the government says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: But the government has banned several publications in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: There have been publications which are very, very, very clearly not Kenyan but are probably being used by external forces. Kenyans have been used as mouthpieces -- but certainly the funding of those papers has come from outside because if you look at the actual circulation, there is no way the circulation can justify the publication of those papers. So, money must be coming from somewhere from outside. And again, if you look at those papers, they are not there for informing people, they are not there for promoting free debate or free press. They are there, basically, to abuse, to create problems; to carry out slander campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Why did your government introduce the practice of queuing, having people stand in line to vote rather than cast ballots? It is a practice which Kenyan churches and international human rights groups have criticized as undemocratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: Elections for the Parliament are still being done through so-called secret balloting. The queuing system is used at the primary stage. So many people, maybe twenty people, could be interested in a position -- and what you want to do is reduce that to two or three people. That is why we use that one at the primary stage, and it is there is to make sure that the election is carried out under the full glare of the people. And the people like it; the people want to say that 'look here, we stood behind so and so, and we expressed our own view'. Secret balloting has bred a lot of corruption in many countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Recently, there have been new criticisms of the churches by Kenyan officials. Do you regard the churches as hostile to the government, as some kind of an unofficial opposition?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: No, no, no, no. The Kenyan Government has always coexisted very well with the church. Our President is a very dedicated Christian. He's a person that attends the church services every Sunday. It is not the church that we have a problem with. If there is any problem, it is with a few individuals who make their own statements. But those are not the statements that represent the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: So you don't foresee a confrontation between the government and, say, the NCCK &cent;National Christian Council of Kenya/? Several assistant ministers in your government have called for a crackdown ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: No, no. I do not think that there's likely to be a problem.  As I say, essentially it is a problem of individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: How would you characterize relations between Kenya and the U. S.  right now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: We consider our relations with the American Government good.  We have been working closely with the American Government over a number of years and we have no reason to believe that there is any tension at all. We are receiving assistance from them, we are collaborating with them in various forms. So, there would be no reason for us to think otherwise. And I don't believe that the American Government has any different view; I've not heard that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: But your government has been criticized in Congress for its human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: We know that Congress, like our parliament, is open; individuals will say what they want to say. The important thing is, it should be understood that we are a democratic country. We are a country committed to development. These are things that need to be taken into account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: The death in mid-February of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko has shaken your country. An investigation is underway, and there have been rumors suggesting his death was ordered by rivals within the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti: Well, the Government is not run on the basis of rumors. The late minister for Foreign Affairs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Cooperation was a very loyal person to the president, to the government, to the party. He was a hard working person. He was a man who was very popular among his own colleagues, and we all feel very aggrieved by his death. Probably the saddest person in the loss is the president himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenya Government has enlisted the support of the British Scotland Yard, which is internationally known as a very competent investigation agency.  We brought them in to work in cooperation with the Kenyan police and the other investigating arms of the government to insure that no stone will be left untouched in really coming to find out what caused the death. That is our commitment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His remarks in Nairobi late last month provoked angry outcries from at least two government officials.

And finally, after several diplomatic answers to questions about Kenya, Tutu minced no words when asked about oppression. After centuries during which people often suffered under those of another race, he said &quot;now in many places those who oppress are often people of the same complexion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archbishop's call for democratic freedoms drew enthusiastic and prolonged applause. &quot;The greatest stability, the greatest prosperity,&quot; he said, &quot;can only come in a situation where people have the freedom to choose freely.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi -- When President Daniel arap Moi summoned leaders of the ruling party from around the country to a day-long gathering here earlier this month, there was intense speculation about what would result. The Kenya African National Union, or Kanu -- the only political organization permitted under the country's one-party system -- has been expanding its authority and control into all sectors of Kenyan society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whenever Kanu meets, we have to wonder who is in for trouble,&quot; said one government critic, referring to purges and crackdowns which have followed party leadership sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest meeting of the Kanu national governing council took place amid signs of renewed tension between the government and top church figures (see Africa News, April 9), leading to conjecture that Moi might be planning a move against the National Christian Council of Kenya (NCCK). It also came just six weeks after the still-unexplained murder of the country's foreign minister, Dr. Robert Ouko, which has spawned a spate of rumors, some of them linking the death to inter-party rivalries or over-zealous Moi supporters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there is no organized voice in Kenya calling for multi-party rule or challenging Kanu's paramount position, events elsewhere in the world apparently have prompted Kenya's leaders, from Moi down, to rush to the defense of the current system. And when Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the anti-apartheid crusader and Nobel laureate, came to town for a meeting of the All Africa Conference of Churches, his comments on the right of people &quot;to choose between different options in any sphere of life&quot; were warmly cheered by a largely-student audience -- and sharply criticized by several government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lively interchange here echoes discussions taking place throughout Africa, as questions are raised about the efficacy and desirability of one-party and autocratic systems, particularly in light of the economic difficulties plaguing most of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have strong pressure developing in Africa, among the elites particularly, for loosening up the machinery of government to allow more opinions, if not parties,&quot; says Hilary Ng'weno, editor of Kenya's leading independent news magazine, Weekly Review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neither the developments in Eastern Europe nor the rumblings at home caused the Kanu council to question the current political structure. &quot;It has definite advantages that far outweigh the costly modern experiments that are strange to the psychology, philosophy and life-style of Kenyans,&quot; the council declared following its April 3 session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Moi has also spoken out on one-party rule on several recent occasions. Last month he was quoted saying a multi-party arrangement could lead to &quot;chaotic situations which would be difficult to reverse,&quot; and more recently he has said it would contribute to &quot;tribal friction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu has been Kenya's sole functioning party throughout most of the post-independence period, although the single party structure was only added to the constitution in 1982. For a period in the 1960s, the Kenya People's Union (KPU) did mount a challenge to Kanu, until violent clashes between the parties' supporters led to the banning of the KPU and the jailing of its leader, Oginga Odinga, by the country's first president, Jomo Kenyatta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That experience, says Vice President George Saitoti, has convinced Kenyans that with a two-party setup &quot;there will be tension and fighting, there will be civil wars, and the country will be diverted from development.&quot; In an interview, he argued that &quot;the two party system did not serve the interests of the people, especially from the point of view of uniting the country.&quot; Saitoti says that within Kanu there is &quot;a very great deal of debate, even during the elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the interchange in the press and the parliament is spirited, Moi has demonstrated a level of intolerance to dissent that has taken his critics by surprise, especially considering the lack of any formalized opposition. The latest victim of the president's displeasure is Waruru Kanja, whose expulsion from Kanu was the main outcome of the national governing council meeting on April 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a 20-year career in politics -- the last two as minister of information -- Kanja was dismissed from the cabinet by Moi the day before the Kanu council convened. Kanja's trouble stemmed from remarks he made last month in parliament, where he linked the Ouko death to the killings of other prominent Kenyan political figures and suggested a connection between the deaths and unnamed government figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Nairobi-based Weekly Review magazine, 29 other Kenyans are currently under expulsion orders from Kanu, including Odinga, who in addition to having lead the only opposition party formed since independence is also a former vice president of both the country and the ruling party. He was ousted from Kanu membership in 1982 when he signalled his intention to set up a new opposition party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's decision that year to institutionalize one-party rule was the first of a series of actions that have eroded the rule of law and protection of individual liberties, says Gibson Kamau Kuria, a prominent Nairobi attorney and human rights advocate. A 1988 constitutional amendment removed the security of tenure from senior judges. &quot;It is a sad state of affairs,&quot; he said in an interview. At Kenya's independence from Britain in 1963, an independent judiciary was established, but &quot;there is no longer any court which can enforce human rights in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preliminary election processes, which require voters to line up behind their preferred candidate rather than cast a secret ballot, has taken the country another step away from democracy, he argues. Kuria says the &quot;queuing&quot; system &quot;which also has been criticized by churches ... is very unpopular.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Vice President Saitoti says queuing is inherently more democratic, because it gives people the assurance that voting is taking place &quot;under the full glare&quot; of public scrutiny. Western-style secret balloting, he says, &quot;has bred a lot of corruption in many countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Saitoti, who is also minister of finance, Moi's leadership has led to stability and steady economic growth, averaging at least five percent annually for the past five years. Saitoti and other Moi supporters say the president is leading the country effectively and enjoys broad popularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But government critics fear the country may be headed for a more repressive future, especially as the problems of economic inequality in the society create wider divisions between the impoverished majority and the political and economic elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa Watch, the New York-based human rights groups, warns that the government may ban the Nairobi Law Monthly, a outspoken journal edited by Gitobu Imanyara.  &quot;The magazine, which was launched in October 1987, remains among the few voices active in the defense of human rights in Kenya, following the ban of other outspoken magazines and a steady campaign of harassment against critics of government policies,&quot; Africa Watch says in a report issued this month. The report appeals to the Kenyan government &quot;to end repression or non-violent dissent and to create an atmosphere within which all Kenyans can freely engage in meaningful public debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three publications have been outlawed in the past two years. Two economic journals, Financial Review and Development Agenda, were banned in 1989, and Beyond, an NCCK magazine was shut down in 1988. But Saitoti argues that Kenya has a free press and that only those publications &quot;being used by external forces&quot; to promote disunity and &quot;slander campaigns&quot; have been banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charges of outside financing and control also have been lodged against Kenya's churches, which form the largest institutional opposition to human rights abuses in the country. The long standing church/state conflict was revived several weeks ago, following the jailing of a Presbyterian minister who was sentenced to six years in prison for making what the government says were &quot;subversive&quot; entries in his personal datebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Church leaders deny any involvement in subversion and have criticized government officials who have been calling for a crackdown against religious bodies. &quot;Our role as churches is to further the Kingdom of God,&quot; says Sam Kobia, the NCCK general secretary. &quot;We are in no way involved in political activities or actions to destabilize the government.&quot; Kobia is hopeful that the recent reopening of a dialogue with government leaders may be helping to reduce distrust and minimize the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Kuria, whose out-spokenness and willingness to take on politically-sensitive cases have earned him international attention and government displeasure, says there is reason to be optimistic. &quot;The world community is becoming intolerant of those who do not respect human rights,&quot; he believes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, Kuria says, there is a &quot;global feeling&quot; that human rights protection is inextricably linked to representative government.  &quot;Although the wind may be blowing slowly in Africa, it is quite clear there will be changes here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The newspaper said the reports of the killings reached the Zambian town of Ndola, on the border with Zaire, 130 miles from Lubumbashi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier last week, the Belgian newspaper Le Soir reported that police had slit the throats of 50 students involved in the unrest. The Zaire government denied the story and threatened legal action against the Brussels-based newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students mounted the protest to demand implementation of the democratic reforms President Mobutu Sese Seko promised in a speech last month, the report says.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president of the Phelps-Stokes Fund for two decades, who helped found the Peace Corps and served as the organization's director for Africa, has died of lung cancer at the age of 72.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franklin Williams was an energetic activist for civil rights, education and African issues, widely admired for his enthusiastic support for equal rights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">As special counsel to the NAACP, he won reversals of death sentences for several young blacks, and as Californ-ia's assistant attorney general, he forced the Professional Golfers' Association to admit blacks to tournament play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was not always in the right place at the right time. In 1966, he arrived in Accra as the U.S. ambassador to Ghana just a month before the coup that deposed pan-Africanist leader Kwame Nkrumah. As a result of public speculation that the CIA had backed the Nkrumah ouster, Williams was plagued by allegations that he had orchestrated the coup. &quot;I was so proud of representing the United States as a black ambassador in Africa,&quot; Williams said later, when asked about the charges. &quot;I knew nothing about it, but I've never been able to escape the suspicion that I got rid of Nkrumah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Williams will be remembered for his constant work at the helm of Phelps-Stokes for disadvantaged American Indians, African-Americans and Africans -- and for the personal assistance he could be counted on to give to countless causes, from the Boys Choir of Harlem to the Bishop Tutu Scholarship Fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A working group established by the South African government and the African National Congress (ANC) has been meeting to resolve several issues which stand in the way of full-scale negotiations about South Africa's future. The group was set up during three days of discussions earlier this month between a ministerial delegation, led by President F.W. de Klerk, and senior ANC officials, headed by Deputy President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The working group is charged with finding &quot;norms and mechanisms&quot; for handling the release of political prisoners and the granting of immunity to persons who took part in illegal activity, such as the guerrilla actions of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the prisoner release and the announcement of immunity is expected to take place soon. But the two parties still differ on what needs to happen next. The government wants the ANC to renounce the use of violence; it blames the group's ambivalence on the issue for encouraging continuing clashes that are claiming lives in various parts of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC is committed to a &quot;mutual suspension of violence&quot; and wants the government to put a stop to the killings of black demonstrators and onlookers by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reed Kramer spoke with some of those who took part in the guerrilla campaign and with friends and families of prisoners awaiting release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town, South Africa -- It takes 45-minutes on the small government-operated ferry -- and an investment of about half a day -- to visit an inmate on Robben Island, one of the world's best-known prisons. But Yasmena Pandy is still making the trip every week to see her husband, Ashley Forbes, who received a 15-year sentence last year for involvement in the military wing of the African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forbes and more than 300 other political activists who took part in the guerrilla campaigns waged by the ANC and by the smaller Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), are expected to be freed as a result of the meetings early this month between the government and the ANC, although no agreement on their release has been announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a long wait for these prisoners and their families since President F. W. de Klerk unbanned the ANC and freed Nelson Mandela in February. &quot;They have been carrying on like they were coming out tomorrow,&quot; Pandy says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men on the island are mostly top echelon members of Umkonto we Size, or Spear of the Nation, the ANC military wing popularly known as &quot;MK.&quot; Forbes was an MK commander in the Cape Town region who is said by the government to have received military training in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a student at the University of the Western Cape when he was captured in 1987, following the detention of a colleague, student leader Peter Jacobs, who confessed to guerrilla activities during interrogation. While questioning Jacobs, using electric shock treatment and other coercive measures to elicit information, the police noticed that Jacobs periodically checked the time. After Jacobs was tricked into thinking it was two hours later than it was, he agreed to lead police to the hide-out which he thought Forbes would have abandoned. But police found Forbes there, still asleep, Pandy says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually Forbes and 14 others, including Jacobs and Pandy, were put on trial. Five were given lengthy sentences with Forbes. Seven others got shorter terms, and Pandy was acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their case was one of many in recent years to provide evidence of the broad scale of ANC underground military activity in many parts of the country.  Most of those convicted in those trials are now serving sentences on Robben Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the top ANC officials imprisoned there is Ebrahim Ismael Ebrahim, who received a 20-year term last year after a trial in which he was accused of masterminding guerrilla attacks from neighboring Swaziland. Ebrahim was abducted from Swaziland in 1986, and although he ended up in police custody in South Africa, the government denied responsibility for the kidnapping. It is the second tour on the island for Ebrahim, who served 15 years after being convicted of sabotage in 1964. After his release in 1979, he plunged right back into ANC activities, his friends say. Ebrahim comes from a politically active Natal family; his brother Gora Ebrahim is a senior PAC official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although conditions have been relaxed in recent weeks, Pandy says she has not managed to have much contact with her husband. &quot;We have to talk through the glass -- and the glass is dirty, our vision is blurred by it,&quot; she says.  &quot;When our time is up they may just close the petition between the glass without any warning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pandy says the thoughts of her husband and the others have turned to life after prison, since President de Klerk announced the unbanning of the ANC. &quot;Ashley nags me about whether I am buying furniture and whether I am looking for a house, &quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there has been little time for house-keeping details as ANC members respond to the organizational demands of the new situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pandy says she has been asked to help a group of striking prison wardens from Pollsmore, the institution where Nelson Mandela was held prior to release on Feb. 11. She had a surprise visit a few weeks ago from several of the women guards she had come to know quite well during the 15 months she spent in the women's section of the prison in 1986. The women, members of the recently-formed Police and Prison Civil Rights Union (Popcru), were suspended after going on strike in a protest against discriminatory pay and labor practices in the prison system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the prisoners emerge from Robben Island, they will be taking up positions in a very different kind of organization from the one they knew before prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC is currently making the transition from a clandestine group with an exiled leadership to the principal aboveground political organization campaigning for democratic change. An ANC office has just been opened in Cape Town, one of 14 being set up to rebuild party structures and establish a presence throughout the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. tour next month by Nelson Mandela is expected to give a boost to the American anti-apartheid movement, which has lost some of its focus since South African President F.W. de Klerk launched his reform program earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Wilkins, national coordinator of the tour, says &quot;the maintenance of sanctions is a key element&quot; of Mandela's U.S. agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For President George Bush, the visit provides an opportunity to pursue the South African policy adopted last year, aimed at promoting peaceful change in South Africa and averting divisive domestic debate. But it could also produce unforeseen political problems, especially if de Klerk's efforts falter or the current moves toward a negotiated solution in South Africa fail.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preparations for Mandela's trip, which will take place between June 20 and 30, have drawn together the diverse coalition which gained passage of a major sanctions package in Congress in 1986 and won approval for numerous divestment and boycott measures in states and localities across the country throughout the 1980s. As requested by Mandela and the African National Congress, American trade unions have a leading role in coordinating the trip, along with churches, civil rights and community organizations, and prominent African-Americans, from the entertainment industry in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to be insane to be trying to do this in a month,&quot; Harry Belafonte told a May 11 meeting of over 100 people convened to set up a national coordinating body. Belafonte and TransAfrica Executive Director Randall Robinson, are principal organizers of the visit. Robinson, who led the 1984-85 demonstrations in front of the South African embassy in support of sanctions, traveled to Johannesburg to finalize arrangements with Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coordinators have had to field a flurry of requests from people and places seeking to be included on the itinerary. Wilkins was chosen to head the effort because &quot;he has the stature and even temperament needed for the job,&quot; one activist said. The George Mason University professor is a former journalist who served in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and was assistant attorney general of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's principal role &quot;is to help spearhead the effort to bring peace,&quot; Wilkins told the Detroit Free Press. &quot;He did not break rocks on Robben Island to enhance the reputation of those who want to get their pictures taken with him,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush issued the invitation to Mandela -- and one to de Klerk -- in February, immediately after de Klerk announced Mandela's release from prison.  It was a natural corollary to previous administration actions, which included White House meetings with a delegation of South African church leaders, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with a delegation from the leading South African anti-apartheid coalition, the pro-ANC United Democratic Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush policy was formally set out in National Security Review (NSR) 15, a secret study drawn up a year ago by an interagency team and signed by the president several month later (see Africa News, May 29 1989). The policy was designed, in the words of Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen, &quot;to nudge both sides to the table by a strong diplomatic effort.&quot; The policy was also fashioned in a manner to attract bipartisan backing in Congress and avoid the disagreements that led Congress to adopt the 1986 sanctions over President Reagan's veto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being overshadowed in Washington by events in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Central America, South Africa is again on the White House agenda. In March, the administration signaled renewed concern about events in the region by sending Secretary of State James Baker to southern Africa. Vice President Dan Quayle had been slated to represent the U.S. at Namibia's independence on March 21. Baker went instead, and visited de Klerk in Cape Town afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mandela agreed to see Baker in Namibia, he criticized the secretary of state for going to South Africa. The ANC has been arguing for a continuation of pressures on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the South African government to insure that real concessions are made when negotiations finally get underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanctions supporters have been fearful that a slippage in American pressure on Pretoria is almost inevitable, unless renewed public anti-apartheid expressions can be mobilized. That is what the Mandela trip promises to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think this comes at a very important time,&quot; says Jennifer Davis, executive director of the American Committee on Africa, the New York-based group which has spearheaded divestment actions in various parts of the country. &quot;It can help underscore support in the U.S. for continued sanctions until apartheid is abolished, and it can help attract American backing for the ANC and progressive forces in South Africa.&quot; The ANC hopes to raise several million</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dollars to support its political activities at home during the Mandela trip, according to Lindiwe Mabuza, the chief ANC representative in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the administration, the visit could create complications that the NSR 15 policy was intended to avoid. The ANC and its supporters have been angered by the decision -- still not formally announced -- to receive de Klerk at the White House a few days prior to Mandela's arrival in this country.  Anti-apartheid groups have promised to dog de Klerk with protests wherever he appears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are just going to have to wait this one out,&quot; one administration official said this week after the controversy over the timing of the two trips arose. &quot;In the end, I ex-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pect both trips will go ahead as planned,&quot; he added. &quot;There would be demonstrations whenever de Klerk comes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">TIGRAY: THE REVOLUTION IS A FAMILY AFFAIR</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1291 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has been fighting the Soviet-backed Ethiopian government for 13 years, the movement has attracted little attention or support in the United States. When it has been mentioned, it has been described most often as 'hard-line' or Marxist-Leninist in orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That perception is incorrect, according to Berhane Gebre, a TPLF Central Committee member who has been in Washington for talks with U.S.  officials, members of Congress and interested groups. He says his movement is a broad front representing the people of Ethiopia's Tigray province and favoring democratic government for all Ethio-pians. Here are excerpts from an Africa News interview with Berhane Gebre last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What happened to the peace talks you were having with the government last year and earlier this year?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gebre: These were preliminary talks dealing mainly with procedures. In the first two rounds, we agreed on some points, but there were two outstanding issues: the composition of the delegation to the substantive talks and the agenda for the main talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These remained to be solved in the third round, but the regime decided to terminate the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: The government refused to continue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gebre: Yes, they refused. We said that the delegates to the main talks should represent the TPLF and EPDM, the Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement. It should be a joint delegation of these two organizations on one side, and the Mengistu regime on the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TPLF is not conducting the war by itself. The TPLF has joined in a united front with the EPDM called the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). This front is conducting war in the provinces of Tigray, Wollo, Gondar and Shoa, where Addis is located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the TPLF cannot deliver peace by itself. Our combatants are fighting together in one trench, so if peace is going to be delivered, it has to be delivered by both. The TPLF said that these two have to come together to the peace negotiations. And the regime said that it wants to discuss only with the TPLF. It doesn't want to involve any other movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other point is the issue of the agenda. The regime said the TPLF could only discuss issues of Tigray, not national matters. But the TPLF is not fighting for secession. The people of Tigray are Ethiopians. We have our rights, and we want to have a democratic Ethiopia, where all the people of Ethiopia have their rights respected. If problems in Tigray are going to be solved, they have to be solved in the context of the country at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: So you don't think there are any prospects for renewed talks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gebre: None at all. The regime is not ready to compromise. The TPLF is flexible. We proposed that we have a fourth round of preliminary talks or that we solve the pending issues in the first phase of the main talks. This was to salvage the peace talks. But the regime decided that it wouldn't continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You see if we go to the main talks, the TPLF's proposal for a transitional government will be tabled. The EPRDF, the united front of the TPLF and EPDM, has proposed there should be a transitional government composed of all political forces. And then there should be a constitution drafted and free elections held for a democratic government. The regime does not want to discuss this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: How does your group propose to deal with Eritrea?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gebre: The Eritrean people should decide their own fate, freely, by referendum. It would be up to the Eritreans to decide whether to be united &cent;with Ethiopia/ or to form an independent state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do not want to continue this war which has gone on for 28 years. If the Eritreans want to be united with us, fine. If the Eritreans decide to form an independent state, we have to respect their will, and we have to try to work on a good relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: The forces of the united front are moving closer and closer to Addis. Do you plan to attack the capital?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gebre: The aim is to remove the Mengistu regime and to establish a provisional government. If the regime accepts a peaceful resolution, then a transitional government could be established. If this regime continues with its stance, then it has to be removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We want to have a smooth and orderly transition. Our main concern at this moment is to broaden our base and bring other opposition forces into the agreement to have a transitional government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Are the people of Tigray receiving food?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gebre: There are three alternative routes, three alternative means of reaching the 2.5 million people affected by famine. The cross-border operation, working through the Sudan, by the Relief Society of Tigray -- REST -- is the most effective. But there are problems. There are not adequate trucks. The second means is for donors to go and buy food in the western part of Tigray, where it's fertile and there is some surplus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third route is the southern corridor, meaning the safe passage that has been conducted by the Ethiopian church organizations -- from &cent;the port of/ Assab to Dessie and from Dessie to Tigray. Their target was to bring in food up to 15,000 metric tons a month, but this is not working effectively.  There are a lot of constraints by the Ethiopian regime -- denying them fuel and creating a lot of bureaucratic problems. At the same time, &cent;the government/ is not allowing other agencies, especially expatriate NGOs &cent;non-governmental organizations/, to work with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can foresee a catastrophe. The famine situation in Tigray is acute.  There are no mass deaths at this moment, but there is mass starvation. Mass deaths are contained because the food that's going through the Relief Society of Tigray is distributed to the most needy ones, who are at the edge of death.  So they are saved from death, but a lot of people are being starved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are worried that the rainy season is coming. When the rainy season starts, transport will be affected, and there won't be much food to be distributed to these people who are in starvation. Food should be transported before the rainy season as much as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Is outside assistance vital, then?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gebre: Yes, yes, there is real need. The people of Tigray are trying to do all they can by themselves. People are working on terracing, on water and soil conservation. They are not folding their hands and waiting for help. What they need at this critical moment is the small support that would enable them to feed themselves and to produce for the coming years. People are really working in a very impressive way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN:Has the TPLF shifted its ideological stance, as has been reported?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gebre: There is lack of understanding of the nature of the TPLF. It has never claimed to be a Marxist-Leninist organization, never. We call it a revolutionary democratic organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TPLF is a broad front; people from all sectors of the population are involved. In the TPLF you'll find dedicated priests, Marxist-Leninists and people with other political and ideological views as well. In Tigray, there is no one who is not involved in the TPLF. The TPLF is a family affair. Everyone has a son, a daughter, a brother, a sister or a husband in the front. So it's a family affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What kind of decision-making structures does the TPLF have?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gebre: The front calls a congress every four years, a congress that is composed of the fighters of the TPLF and people from all villages and regions of Tigray. And, as well, Tigrean exiles from the United States, Europe, the Sudan, and other countries have mass associations which elect representatives and send them to the congress. The congress adopts general policies and elects a leadership for four years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1942 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With his forces suffering repeated setbacks on the battlefield, Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam is grasping for ways to save his 15-year rule over Africa's oldest nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, 12 high-ranking and well-known military officers were unexpectedly executed for their role in an attempted coup against him a year ago. Mengistu, who said recently that he has survived nine attempts on his life, had been expected to grant the men clemency, to avoid further erosion of his popularity in both military and civilian circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the executions are characteristic of a regime that achieved and maintained power through the violent elimination of its opponents. Mengistu was one of a group of army officers who forcibly seized control of the ruling military council, known as the Dergue, in November, 1974. They staged their coup just two months after military leaders deposed Emperor Haile Selassie, ending a half-century of rule by the man known as the &quot;Lion of Judah.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1975, Mengistu emerged from a series of bloody internal feuds as the most influential Dergue member, and he became chairman and head of state in 1977. Under Mengistu's control, the Dergue launched a wholesale assault against the country's major political parties, the largest of which shared the rulers' avowed Marxist-Leninist orientation. After thousands of killings during a period known as the &quot;red terror,&quot; organized opposition to military control was crushed. Mengistu now governs under a 1987 constitution which established an 85-seat national legislature and a council of state headed by the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Soviet support diminishing and Eastern European aid ended, Mengistu has indicated an interest in improved relations with the U.S. In March, he promised to allow additional political parties to compete with the ruling Workers' Party of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, he defended his policies to Charlayne Hunter-Gault of the &quot;MacNeil Lehrer NewsHour,&quot; in his first interview on American television. Here are major excerpts from that conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: Mr. President, the widely held view is that this war has your government up against the wall. Is that wrong?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: This situation in the north, this fighting, is a situation we inherited. It is not our situation. One should ask, what is the origin of this war; what is its genesis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the purpose of the revolution was to provide a solution to the problem in the north, to this long-running struggle. Right away, on the triumph of the revolution, we approached the dissidents in the north. They asked us to recognize their rights to secede from Ethiopia. But how can a government representative of the Ethiopian people allow this demand? To allow the secession of this part of Ethiopia would be, really, to commit national suicide. We do not want to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an endemically drought-stricken area. We have been approached by international donor organizations who want to provide food for the people.  So we said okay, food may come through the port of Massawa. And precisely as we let ourselves provide food for the hungry, the rebels try to encumber international passage. This is the second time they have captured the port of Massawa, timing it precisely with the drought situation in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: But how do you respond to the criticism that both sides are putting military objectives before the consideration of starving people? They, as you say, keep capturing the port and you in turn keep bombing the port, destroying hundreds of tons of food as you attempt to recapture this port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: It wasn't we who first bombed the city of Massawa.  It was the rebels in their effort to capture this port who have destroyed the port facilities and the whole city. That the capture of Massawa came precisely at the very moment when the port was most needed for the supply of food for the hungry is something international public opinion should have condemned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why should the international donor community insist on the port of Massawa for the transport of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">food when there is an alternative route accepted by the United Nations? We have used it in the past and we are using it now. To insist that this food must go through the port of Massawa is really an effort to legalize the illegal capture of the port of Massawa -- something which we cannot allow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: There are many observers who are saying the situation on the battlefield has deteriorated to the extent that a military solution is close to impossible. Do you disagree with that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: Our option has never been military. We firmly believe that the solution lies in a peaceful dialogue on the problem in the north. The most anomalous thing in this is that they have begun to harden their position, become more intransigent. The talks that were held got stalled because they did not want to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: So you are saying that there are no new elements now in the equation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: There are no new elements because of their inflexibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: The overwhelming impression is of a country that is impoverished, people who are starving, and political forces who really don't care. How do you counter that image? Does that worry you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: The perception the world has of Ethiopia is not really the real perception. We are fighting people who have all the sophisticated weapons and medicine they need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where do the supplies come from? Definitely there must be strong forces behind the conflict that are driving it. We are fighting against these forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: Which country are you specifically referring to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: Well, some of these countries have far-reaching plans to destabilize some African countries. It is some of the Arab countries of the region; it is not all of them. For example, Libya is spearheading this, and others. Some of them are providing arms and the others are providing funds. Several countries are involved in this hostile act in one way or another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: But in that connection, there is a whole new concern arising with the Soviets pulling out of Ethiopia and ending support for you. There are reports now that Israel is stepping in to fill that breach. Because Israel is stepping in in your country, the Arabs are responding to appeals from the opposition forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: This allegation is entirely baseless. There is no truth in that we are trying to replace the Soviet Union with Israel and that we have entered into a military pact with Israel. There is absolutely no grounds for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: Your recent dramatic announcement of a new economic reform program which moved away from Marxism came as a surprise to many people. What was the objective of the socialist revolution in the first place and what went wrong?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: Ethiopia has been basically a mixed economy. To give you a figure, 70% of the Ethiopian economy is privately owned and 30% of that is owned jointly by the state and cooperative sectors. On the whole, agriculture in our country is very primitive. We thought &cent;that/ only by meeting some prerequisites could we introduce a degree of modern agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step was to settle the people, to regroup peasants, in a specific area where we could get things through to them easily. It was a non-ideological approach to introduce modern agriculture and modern technology rapidly in the rural area. Of late we have discovered that this did not help productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: But specifically what are you planning to do? People are waiting for the next step because they remain skeptical. You have announced reforms, but the specifics of your plan to implement them are still the source of some confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: In the past there was nothing that we did to promote the private sector, but now we've come out in grand style to provide all types of assistance that the private sector would wish to have in order to develop agriculture and legal protection and so on. As far as cooperatives are concerned, the law will allow peasant farmers who wish to continue as cooperatives to do so and for those who don't, the law would allow them to disband and set up as private peasant farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: How would you rewrite this chapter of Ethiopian history -- a chapter which often refers to you as the cruel dictator -- Mengistu, a man who refuses to allow political expression, who brutally suppresses dissent and who is indifferent to human life. How would you rewrite that chapter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: A man made in this image in the first place would not be qualified to come to power in Ethiopia. My personality, my nature, is judged by the Ethiopian people. What is paramount for me, as it is for the Ethiopian people, is the unity of the country, the sovereignty of the country, and I am not ready to compromise on that. Personally, I do not want to see anything die, not even an insect. But the truth is, I am not ready to compromise on the supreme interest of the Ethiopian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: How soon do you plan to put your government before the people? Do you plan, as you proceed with the economic reforms, to open up your system so that the people can vote?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: The armed forces elected me to assume power precisely at the moment when the country was deeply in anarchy. It was a time when the country was encircled by enemy forces. Its days before disintegration were numbered. I was elected to take power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To start off, we did not set up a military junta. As soon as we came to power, we went to the people to find out what they wanted, to get a mandate. We put ballot boxes everywhere for people to give us their views. The people gave us their guidance, they told us what to do. So on the basis of the guidance given us by the people, we set up a provisional military government and saved the country from the danger that was hovering over it at that moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: So do you expect anytime in the foreseeable future there will be opposition parties able to contest, to participate in the political process?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: What everyone must realize is the unity and the social security of the country is paramount. This is one of the most ancient countries in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its long past, Ethiopia never knew a party line. The first party in Ethiopian history was set up by us. This party is still in its initial stage; it has a long distance to go to mature. It is this government that introduced a republican form of government, by the will of the people. In the future, if the need arises and situations justify the emergence of multiparties, naturally we are flexible and will allow them to exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question: Finally Mr. President, let me just ask you as you reflect on all the things that we have talked about: the war, the famine, the economic conditions in your country, the perception outside. Do you yourself at this point have any regrets about the past 15 years of your administration, anything you wish you could change?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mengistu: We have planned in the past for the social and economic betterment of our people and I must say our performance has been really good and I don't really have regrets. There are no areas where I say our performance was poor so I have no bad conscience at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But of course the most lamentable thing that I do regret is that we do not have peace. My grandparents did not know peace, my father did not know peace in this country and I don't know peace and, who knows, my children may also never experience peace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ancient African nation of Ethiopia, whose modern era has been plagued by constant warfare, may be on the verge of dramatic political change. Many observers are predicting the imminent downfall of President Mengistu Haile Mariam, who has been in power since 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troops from the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and an alliance of other Ethiopian opposition movements are advancing on the capital, Addis Ababa. They say their aim is to overthrow the current regime and install an interim administration to oversee free elections. At the same time, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) -- fighting for the independence of the northern territory annexed by Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie in 1962 -- is poised to attack Asmara, the capital of the disputed region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three decade-long conflict in Eritrea and the more recent fighting in Tigray have claimed an estimated 400,000 casualties, and deaths continue to mount. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Herman Cohen has called the conflict &quot;possibly the largest in terms of combatants and the most destructive in the world today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the fighting, more than three million people face starvation, according to estimates by various aid experts, although a major international relief effort has averted the kind of disaster that Ethiopia experienced in 1984-85, when as many as a million people died from starvation.  &quot;Response to this need has come from around the world,&quot; Cohen said in recent testimony before the Senate Africa subcommittee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donated supplies are being delivered to hungry people in Eritrea, Tigray and other famine-afflicted areas &quot;under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions,&quot; according to Remer Tyson of the Detroit Free Press, who recently made a 1,000-mile reporting trip through Eritrea. &quot;Food is reaching people in far corners of the parched, barren countryside,&quot; Tyson says in a report published last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neil Henry of the Washington Post, who spent 13 days early this month traveling in Tigray, also found evidence that the relief effort is &quot;accomplishing a great deal to stem the human suffering wrought by drought and civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry rode with one of the truck convoys that the Relief Society of Tigray operates to transport food from the southeastern Sudanese town of Gedaref to the interior of the province. These &quot;heroic caravans,&quot; carrying food donated by the U.S., Canada, and the European Community, travel by night to avoid shelling from Ethiopian fighter jets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Promptly at sundown each day, the big green relief-society trucks, each filled with 15 tons of cargo, line up at the outskirts of Gedaref where they start up with a mighty roar and begin to roll,&quot; Henry says in a May 17 dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a tough, bone-jarring, teeth-rattling ride over makeshift dirt roads, pitted with stones and craters,&quot; he writes. &quot;Amid the cacophony of whining engines, thick wafts of dust pervade the truck cabins so that by dawn drivers and riders alike are covered with grit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pleased by the achievements to date, aid officials are nevertheless concerned that international support for the relief effort not diminish. &quot;The situation is quite precarious,&quot; says Andrew Natsios, director of the U.S.  Foreign Disaster Assistance Agency. Additional supplies are needed in Eritrea, Tigray and several other regions, aid officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Berhane Gebre, a TPLF official currently visiting the U.S., there is still widespread famine in Tigray, even though mass deaths there have been warded off up to now (see page 7). But with the approach of the rainy season, he says, the situation will become much more dangerous, since it will be almost impossible to transport food to many areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Eritrea, the situation for many people &quot;has deteriorated rapidly,&quot; David Holdridge of Catholic Relief Services told Congress recently. Since February, when the EPLF captured the port of Massawa and government forces responded by aerial bombing raids on the town, relief supplies which were formerly routed through the port have had to be transported by a southern route from Sudan through Tigray to rebel-held areas of Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPLF controls most of the province and recently began bombarding the airport outside Asmara, apparently in preparation for a major assault on the Eritrean capital, which is defended by about 100,000 government troops.  &quot;Latest reports indicate that over 400,000 people in Asmara are in need of relief assistance,&quot; Holdridge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department has been working towards an agreement to allow the port to be reopened under United Nations auspices to permit the resumption of much-needed relief shipments. But Mengistu has resisted any arrangement that would &quot;legalize the illegal capture&quot; of the town, he has said (see accompanying interview).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, the House Select Committee on Hunger appealed to President George Bush and President Mikhail Gorbachev to take up the Ethiopian issue at this week's summit in Washington. The Committee called upon the Soviets to stop supplying arms to the Ethiopian government and asked all parties to permit unrestricted passage of relief shipments to civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the Soviets are reported to have reduced their support for the regime by cutting military assistance and withdrawing the bulk of their military advisers. Mengistu has also lost the support he had from East Germany and other Eastern European governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, the beleaguered president announced an about-face in his economic policies. He said Ethiopia was abandoning Marxist-oriented central planning and allowing greater involvement by private enterprise. He lifted government controls on farming, agricultural marketing and ownership of private property. And he appealed for foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But little economic progress can be expected while the war rages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC. -- When a Liberian exile named Charles Taylor led about a hundred poorly armed men into Liberia on Christmas eve, few people took the invasion seriously. But the harsh response of government forces has turned what might have been a minor rebellion into a movement that threatens to topple the Doe government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the rebels, who now number several thousand, are villagers -- including women and young people -- who joined the fight after indiscriminate killing of civilians by government forces. International human rights groups say that the original invasion was itself bloody, and aimed particularly at President Samuel Doe's Krahn ethnic group. But in the months since, under the banner of Taylor's National Patriotic Front (NPF), the rebels have broadened their support. NPF spokesman Tom Woewiyu says the group has backing from every segment of Liberian society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So little was known about the invaders when they entered Nimba County that the questions began to sound like a reprise of the Butch Cassidy movie: &quot;Who are those guys?&quot; Many Liberians were reassured when Taylor issued a statement on January 1 saying that the NPF is &quot;a non-sectarian nationalist movement which believes in the right of every Liberian to equal protection and opportunity under the law and which does not subscribe to ethnic and social factionalism or recriminations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials had their own view of the NPF's intentions. In February 21 testimony before a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs subcommittee, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Schifter called the rebellion against Doe &quot;a Libyan-supported effort to overthrow him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Designed to overthrow Doe -- &quot;yes,&quot; says the NPF's Woewiyu; Libyan-sponsored -- &quot;no.&quot; The rebellion is, he says, &quot;just a coalition of grassroots citizens.&quot; If the group had Libyan backing, he asks, why did it invade the country, armed with only a few hand weapons? -- a fact testified to by refugees' eyewitness accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woewiyu says the fighters now have an abundance of arms captured from fleeing government forces, but he does not deny that the NPF's success has attracted outside interest and support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for 42-year-old Charles Taylor, he, like many educated Liberians, studied in the United States. And like many who now oppose the Doe government, he went home after Doe promised to bring democracy to Liberia with his 1980 coup. When the government charged that he embezzled funds in his job as head of Liberia's General Services Agency, he fled back to the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While being represented by former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark in an appeal against extradition to Liberia, Taylor escaped from a Massachusetts jail. Stories that he spent at least part of the five years since then getting military training in Libya have circulated widely in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor's proclaimed beliefs, though, are firmly in favor of American-style democracy. &quot;We are American in terms of our philosophy on government and on economy,&quot; says Tom Woewiyu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Woewiyu questions why the U.S. administration has been so slow to realize that the Doe era is over. &quot;Doe is dead,&quot; Woewiyu said, during a break from meetings on Capitol Hill. &quot;He's just not smart enough to lie down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woewiyu promises that the NPF will form a transitional government of &quot;the best and brightest Liberians&quot; to organize national elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal should be balloting within two years, says the Association for Constitutional Democracy in Liberia, a Washington-based network of Liberian groups and individuals working for &quot;the establishment of a democratic society based on the Liberian constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association has called for Doe to step down and for both sides to observe a ceasefire. It also says that the &quot;problems of Liberia can only be solved by Liberians themselves,&quot; but leaders of the group acknowledge that the United States could play an important role in promoting peace by guaranteeing Doe's safety if he resigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way or another, says Woewiyu, Liberians will get democracy. &quot;It is possible in Africa,&quot; he says. &quot;People have got this belief that the good things that happen around the world are not possible in Africa. We know that &cent;democracy/ is possible, and we are hoping that in the future it will reign not only in Liberia but all over Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. interests in Liberia are &quot;not well-understood by many Americans,&quot; says James Bishop, who has served as Ambassador to Liberia for the last three years. &quot;We've had a uniquely intimate relationship with the Liberians over the course of over a hundred and fifty years now,&quot; Bishop says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberians have been very receptive to American influence and presence, and as a result, we have several facilities there that are important to our ability to conduct business in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those facilities, Bishop says, are &quot;the principal broadcast station for Africa of the Voice of America,&quot; and &quot;a diplomatic communications facility which makes it possible for us to communicate with our embassies in Africa in a fashion which would be impossible without that installation.&quot; And, says Bishop, &quot;we have had ready access to the ports and airfield in Liberia for purposes which have served our national interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a navigation system -- &quot;rather old but still important,&quot; Bishop says -- that helps guide ships and aircraft in international waters and airspace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">952 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC. -- With Liberian rebels poised to attack the capital of Monrovia and end the ten-year rule of President Samuel Doe, representatives sent by both sides for discussions with U.S. officials in Washington agreed on one thing: Liberia's problem is also an American problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States has an obligation to help Liberia achieve a political compromise,&quot; says Winston Tubman, leader of a government-authorized delegation that has been lobbying members of Congress and State Department planners for the last two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, we know we are a small country,&quot; Tubman says, &quot;and President Bush is busy &cent;with/ Eastern Europe, but the problem of Liberia has an older history than that, and it is a direct responsibility of the United States.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That claim is based on the special, historical relationship between the two countries, dating from Liberia's founding as an independent republic by freed American slaves in 1847. Its government was modeled on the U.S.  constitution; its red, white and blue flag is a variation on the stars and stripes; its capital is named for President James Monroe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the ties have remained close. The U.S. is Liberia's main investor and trading partner. Firestone Tire and Rubber Company operates the world's biggest rubber plantation at Harbel, 31 miles east of Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During much of the recent past, the West African nation, which is slightly smaller than the state of Virginia, has been the largest per capita recipient of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa -- $ 500 million in the last decade and has hosted 4,500 Peace Corps Volunteers. More than 5,000 Americans live and work in Liberia and the U.S. dollar is legal currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1987, after mounting complaints by Doe's Congressional critics about the government's fiscal irregularities and its corruption, the Reagan administration dispatched a 17-person team to Liberia to manage the country's finances. A year before its two-year mandate ended, the team returned to the U.S., citing lack of cooperation from Liberian officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel spokesman Tom Woewiyu says the U.S. government should force President Doe to step down. &quot;Samuel Doe was given millions and millions of dollars and used it against our people,&quot; Woewiyu says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When money comes from a democratic country, collected from a democratic-minded people, from their hard-earned tax money,&quot; he says, &quot;the U.S. has an obligation to make sure those monies are applied to democratic principles and democratic efforts, not to a dictatorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woewiyu urges Americans to insist that their government not &quot;support dictators just because they are convenient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of Doe's suppression of opposition forces has been raised frequently by human rights organizations. In a report issued this month, the Washington. D.C.-based Africa Watch says that the Reagan administration &quot;missed many opportunities to promote human rights in Liberia.&quot; Accepting the results of the &quot;fraudulent election of 1985&quot; was an example, the report says, of &quot;a willful ignorance of past and ongoing abuses by the regime of Samuel Doe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Finance Minister Ellen Johnson Sirleaf won the largest number of votes of any candidate in that election. But she fled the country after being jailed for treason. She now is vice president of Equator Bank in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, Sirleaf wrote to Richard Shifter, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, asking for protection for herself and six other Liberians in the United States who she said had been targeted for assassination by the Doe government. The reply thanked Sirleaf for bringing the matter to State Department attention and suggested she notify appropriate officials about the danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks later, in congressional testimony, Shifter said that the U.S. ambassador to Liberia has been spending &quot;more than half of his time, in terms of contacts with the Liberian government . . . expressing himself on human rights problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambassador, James Bishop, is now back in Washington, preparing to become the U.S. ambassador to Somalia. Bishop says that &quot;human rights and economic reform are at the head of the agenda for our discussions with Liberia and have been for ten years.&quot; As the coordinator of an ad hoc State Department working group on the Liberian crisis, Bishop has been at the center of discussions with the various parties to the fighting, but he will say only that &quot;the United States has offered its good offices in the current conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tubman says that good offices aren't enough. &quot;If the &cent;Liberian/ government position is that they will not talk, and the rebels' position is that they will not talk with the Doe government,&quot; he says, &quot;then you have a situation where there has to be some other intervention to make that happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When told that such an appeal sounds strange coming from the head of a government delegation, Tubman argues that he -- along with several other members of the bipartisan group, which includes trade union and church representatives -- do not speak for the government, although Doe approved their trip. Tubman himself is a former United Nations ambassador from Liberia whose uncle, William Tubman, was Liberian president from 1944 to 1971. His group did not come, Tubman says, to defend what has happened in Liberia in the past, but to seek U.S. help in stopping the war before it reaches the civilian population of Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not saying they should send American troops,&quot; Tubman says. &quot;The U.S. exerts considerable pressure and influence in so many ways. I do not know all of the ways available to the American government, but they are considerable, and, in Liberia, they would be decisive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

President Omar Bongo says he dispatched the troops to enable Shell and Elf oil companies to resume production at their facilities there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since oil provides 80% of the country's export revenues, the government said the interruption posed a serious threat to the national economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests in the capital city of Libreville were put down by enforcement of a curfew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests were sparked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the suspicious death of Joseph Redjambe, leader of the Gabonese Progress Party (PGP), on May 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PGP claims that Redjambe was murdered by drug injection after entering a hotel with a woman from Cote d'Ivoire, hired by Bongo.  Authorities have issued a report saying Redjambe died of natural causes, and that the syringe marks on his stomach were caused by the injection of drugs to treat diabetes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition party leader was found dead the day after Gabon's National Assembly approved a constitution providing for a multiparty election in September, ending 28 years of one-party rule by Bongo and his Gabonese Democratic Party. The government says the rioting will not stall the process of democratic reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of France dispatched a parachute regiment to reinforce the 500 French troops already in the country. The paratroopers were sent after PGP members held French Consul General Jean Duffau and eight other French citizens for several hours, demanding that France pressure Bongo to resign.</SPAN></P>

Choices made in the next ten years will determine the quality of life in the 21st century, UNFPA says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">World population stands at $ 5.2 billion and is increasing by over 92 million a year. Over 90% of the growth is occurring in developing countries, which are least able to cope with such increases. Children under the age of 15 comprise over 37% of the population of poor countries; in Africa, children account for 45-50%. In the developing world's mushrooming cities, 40-50% of the inhabitants are living in overcrowded conditions, lacking virtually all services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To effectively confront population challenges, the report says, the role and participation of women must improve, infant and child mortality rates must be lowered and policies aimed at reducing population growth must be implemented at local, national and international levels.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eve Lackritz and her colleagues from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) faced questions at Siaya District Hospital that only medical research could answer. Do the blood transfusions given to severely anemic children really save lives? And if the blood does save lives but, at the same time, has the possibility of transmitting the virus that causes AIDS, how can hospital staff decide when to risk transfusions and when to wait?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the CDC researchers designed a study to evaluate the association between blood transfusion and survival among children admitted to the hospital with severe anemia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After six-months of monitoring the admissions and treatment of 1,250 children, the researchers have been able to make real progress towards answering the questions. They found that among an easily-identified group of children, blood transfusion leads to a significantly improved survival rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children under two years of age, with hemoglobin levels of less than 3.5 grams per deciliter -- levels of 13 are considered normal and below 11 is classified as anemia -- had a better chance of surviving, especially if the transfusion took place soon after admission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, when the hemoglobin at admission is 3.5 or better, transfusion is no longer associated with improved survival. The study also found that discontinuing transfusions to children with hemoglobins over 4 would have reduced the number of transfusions given by the hospital by a third. Since children under two years old accounted for 93% of all admissions with a hemoglobin less than 5 and received 94% of all transfusions, &quot;we have found our target group,&quot; Lackritz says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results suggest that limiting transfusions to children with hemoglobins under 4 would have little adverse effect on survival while protecting a third of the children admitted to the hospital from exposure to blood that might be infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eve Lackritz cautions that the results are preliminary. Although the study was a complex one designed to take a variety of factors into account, it was impossible to totally control the research process. Nevertheless, Siaya Hospital has already begun to be more conservative about the use of transfusions. &quot;After all, they do read our protocols,&quot; Lackritz says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the research points the way to developing a model that can be used for risk/benefit analysis in other countries by taking into account local variables such as the percentage of the blood supply that carries HIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1859 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Siaya District, Kenya -- East Africa has been hard hit by the AIDS virus.  Latest World Health Organization statistics place Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania in the top ten countries for the total number of fatal AIDS cases reported worldwide. Kenya ranks eighth. The disease is already draining national healthcare budgets. And now it is making it more difficult to treat other health problems as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Siaya District Hospital in western Kenya, the problem begins with a two-month old baby with spindly arms, trying to suck his mother's breast as she sits on a wooden bench. Eve Lackritz, an American researcher from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control who has spent several months at the hospital, says she can diagnose the baby's problem without even doing a blood test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are basically no red blood cells here to give this child any color,&quot; she says. &quot;If we look at this two-month old, the palm is white, the tongue is white, he is literally white.  There is absolutely no color here at all.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The baby's color is a result of anemia -- anemia that is itself a result of malaria. Malaria parasites are destroying his red blood cells, and that, in turn, is starving his body for oxygen. That's commonplace for this part of Kenya, where dozens of children with malaria-caused anemia come to this small hospital every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You or I would have to get hit by a truck and lose a huge amount of blood volume to be as anemic as this child is now,&quot; Lackritz says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the baby squirms and tries to get back to his mother's breast, a hospital technician takes out an old-fashioned barber's razor, without any cream, and begins shaving the child's head.  The hospital staff is about to give the baby the same treatment they give more than seven hundred other children each year. They are going to slip an IV needle into the baby's head -- older patients get the needle in their arm -- and give him a blood transfusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For decades now, hospitals across Africa have turned to blood to treat patients with diseases from malaria to malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Blood transfusion is widely used, vastly more than in the US,&quot; says Kent Campbell of the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Based at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, Campbell roams the globe in an attempt to better understand and control malaria. When he visits Siaya Hospital, where a study of blood transfusion has been underway, he works at a counter in the hospital's small lab with his microscope and blood smears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a typical American medical center, only a tiny fraction of the children get a transfusion, far less than one percent. But at hospitals such as Siaya, almost one third of the children get blood. The transfusions here usually don't cure the childrens' illnesses.  The childrens' main problem is that they have a chronic disease like malaria, or a respiratory infection, or hookworm, or malnutrition, or maybe a combination of all those diseases, and anemia is just one of the symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It isn't anemia, per se, which is the problem,&quot; Campbell says. &quot;It is some other disease which has brought the child to the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A blood transfusion can ease the symptom and make the child stronger for a while -- and sometimes even save the child's life -- but to cure the underlying disease, Campbell says, doctors need to treat the children with drugs or sophisticated medical equipment that many African hospitals don't have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When medicines are short, which they can be in many parts of Africa,&quot; says Campbell, &quot;blood is more available than drugs, and this is the dilemma.  Many times you have so little to offer to a patient. Blood is available, therefore it is offered when nothing else may be around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now the AIDS virus is changing all that. Just consider the basic statistics. Thirty percent of blood donors in some regions of Africa are infected with the HIV virus which causes AIDS, and studies show that patients who get blood transfusions that are tainted with the AIDS virus are almost certain to become infected themselves. So even though countries like Kenya have begun screening blood as much as possible, researchers like Campbell say the transfusions are risky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no question that they are spreading the virus.&quot; he says.  &quot;That's been documented. HIV is being spread and will continue to be spread by blood transfusion until a much clearer understanding of how to effectively use blood transfusion has been developed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the same blood transfusion that may save a child's life, in the short term, may also transmit an infectious disease,&quot; says Campbell, &quot;the doctors in these clinics face a real dilemma. You have to ask yourself, what is a doctor to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Campbell and his CDC colleagues have made several research trips to Siaya Hospital to help the Kenyans sort it out.  They have been focusing on children who have malaria-caused anemia, because it puts more children in the hospital and causes more blood transfusions than any other disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one room of the childrens' ward there are ten beds, like narrow army cots squeezed side by side along the walls.  The hospital doesn't have enough space to give each child his or her own cot, so two sick children have to share many of the beds. On one of them lies a skinny little girl, Eve Okol, who was checked into the ward three days ago. The girl lies awake but motionless on a cot -- which also holds her mother plus another patient and his mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ward nurse, Veronica Opia Oroko, stops by to check Eve Okol's chart. &quot;Eve was running fever,&quot; Opia Oroko says, &quot;she was vomiting, she had swelling of the legs, and diarrhea, loose stools.  This was severe anemia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As researchers struggle to find a way to avoid giving blood to children, mothers like Eve's are consumed with the struggle to buy blood for their children because doctors have always said the blood will cure them. Until last year in Kenya, most patients like Eve got treated for free. But the government is running out of money, so under a new policy, patients' families now have to pay for at least part of the treatments and for the hospital food.  And the hospital won't give Eve a transfusion until her mother scrapes up the cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the girl is awaiting transfusion,&quot; Opia Oroko explains. &quot;But the mother is still unable to purchase the items which have to be used, like a blood pack, blood-giving set and a needle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such situations have placed an additional burden on the small hospital's staff. At Siaya, when a child is very ill with anemia, and the family cannot find the money to pay for a transfusion, the nurses have been known to pay for treatment out of their own pockets. &quot;Yes, sometimes we do,&quot; admits Opia Oroko. &quot;Sometimes in crisis we do. That child -- I couldn't let it die while there was blood there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when children like Eve get their transfusions and go home, chances are they will come back in a month or two for more transfusions. Blood is only a temporary treatment, and children leave the hospital still suffering from the underlying disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the more transfusions the children get, the greater the risk of getting AIDS.  Kent Campbell says that the frustrating irony of all this is that the hospitals could probably cure the vast majority of these children without giving any blood -- if the hospital medicine cabinets had more antibiotics and better anti-malarial drugs, and if researchers can develop an easy test that could identify the few children who really do need a transfusion to survive, rather than the majority who don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to do that, researchers need a lot more information.  They need to know the hemogloban levels of all the children, what kind of symptoms they get and what happens to the patients after they leave the hospital.  That kind of research is hard to do in a hospital like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the things you want &cent;to know/,&quot; Campbell says, &quot;is what percentage of all the kids coming into the hospital have malaria.&quot; In the American system you could probably pretty easily get a sense of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a Kenyan regional hospital like Siaya, with few resources, crowded wards and an overworked staff, record keeping becomes secondary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Eve Lackritz says, the hospital cannot even tell how many children die here on any given day. And it's not just a problem of bad records. When a child dies, the family has to pay almost a hundred dollars to get the body out of the morgue.  Because many families cannot afford the fee, they sneak the small corpse out of the hospital before the morticians can count it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is a problem,&quot; Lackritz says, &quot;when you are trying to figure out who is your target population and who is dying and where you can make an intervention to keep people from dying. If you don't even know who is dying and how many, it is hard to get a handle on the matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, don't even bother asking for statistics about the issue that created all of this concern in the first place: how many patients who get blood transfusions actually get infected with the virus that causes AIDS?  There is not enough information to begin to give a firm answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan health officials like Dan Wendo, chief medical officer at Siaya hospital, say blood transfusions pose a small risk because, according to a national policy, all blood has to be screened for the AIDS virus before its used.  In fact, Window says, Siaya hospital has its own AIDS virus testing computer which allows them to screen blood right in their small laboratory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the testing, the AIDS virus can still be transmitted, according to health professionals. The CDC's Kent Campbell says he cannot talk specifically about Siaya hospital because there are not enough data.  But in general, he says, even the most sophisticated laboratories make mistakes when they are screening blood for HIV.  Studies suggest that up to one percent of the blood samples that a lab test says are safe are really infected with the AIDS virus.  And the risk is higher, Campbell points out, in a situation where blood transfusions are frequent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One percent may sound like an awfully small percentage,&quot; he says.  &quot;But on the other hand, when you multiply one percent by many transfusions, that becomes a regrettably large number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Campbell says, many hospital labs in poor countries are not very sophisticated.  Where lab technicians are not highly trained in running the complicated AIDS screening test, more infected blood slips through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campbell says that until Kenyan hospitals are able to avoid using such large amounts of blood to treat desperately ill patients, an unknown number of children will go to hospitals to cure their malaria-caused anemia -- and they will leave infected with the AIDS virus instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that a growing number of medical centers, like the one in Siaya, are at least trying to screen their blood.  The staff at Siaya have covered the walls and doors here with posters that show a big fist scrunching the words: &quot;Let's crush AIDS.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria, South Africa - If Albie Sachs has his way, South Africa -- arguably among the most polluted lands on earth -- will become the second in the world to protect its ecology in a Bill of Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sachs, an attorney and university professor who recently returned from exile, is a prominent thinker on constitutional issues for the African National Congress. At a conference in Pretoria organized by Lawyers for Human Rights, Sachs presented a strong appeal for environmental rights to be safeguarded in a post-apartheid constitution. &quot;It is not just playing with metaphors to say that we are fighting to free the land, the waters, the sky as well as the people,&quot; says Sachs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sachs acknowledges that resistance movements have compelling concerns that tend to exclude the environment from their agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we must take responsibility for our country and its future in all its dimensions and implant the question of conservation firmly within our social and geographic reality,&quot; Sachs told the Pretoria conference. &quot;Human rights in the broadest sense are indivisible,&quot; he said. &quot;When we breathe the air of freedom, we do not want to choke on hidden fumes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a section of his talk called, &quot;Do Trees Have Rights?,&quot; Sachs outlined ways that respect for ecosystems could be entrenched in the future constitution of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia is the only other country in the world that has included the environment in its constitution. A section in that nation's charter requires the state to actively promote policies that protect the territory's ecosystems and biological diversity. It also stipulates that natural resources be used by industry and communities in a sustainable way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preamble for a South African constitution, Sachs said, could define principles upon which South Africans should relate to each other and their natural environment. He suggested the charter could include provisions that would oblige the state to examine the potential environmental impact of any laws that pass through its legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate code for the environment, linked to the constitution but more detailed in its provisions, could lay down regulations regarding pollution, the disposal of toxic waste, soil erosion and protection of species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally,&quot; Sachs said, &quot;the constitution could acknowledge that our country is part of the African continent and the question of ecology has both a regional and a continental dimension.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although concern for the environment in South Africa has, until recently, been subsumed by the more burning issues of race and class, Sachs believes that those who take part in the fight against apartheid are driven by an urge to reconnect with nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we say 'Mayibuye i'Afrika' -- 'come back Africa,'&quot; he says, &quot;we are calling for the return of legal title but also for the restoration of the land, the forest and the atmosphere. The greening of our country is basic to its healing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sachs warns that constitutional protections will not be worth the paper they are written on if a post-apartheid state does not deal with the problems of the laboring poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although, air pollution and environmental toxins cut across race, and class divisions, he says. &quot;We often forget that the most immediate victims are the workers who are expected to spray trees or handle toxic materials without themselves being protected. The guarantee of a safe and clean working environment becomes a key question for any trade union and integrates itself into the question of a safe and clean South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sachs insists that a serious program to protect and mend the country's ecosystems has to deal with the question of poverty and the need to provide all citizens with basic social and welfare facilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White South Africans are responsible for more of the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain and a possible &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; than any other population group in the world, says a report published by the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research group. The document says the statistics for carbon emissions are part of a larger picture of environmental deterioration that is linked to South Africa's apartheid policies and that political reforms could begin to ease many of the problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a per person basis,&quot; says Apartheid's Environmental Impact, &quot;white South Africans are the world's worst greenhouse offenders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, written by Worldwatch senior researcher Alan B. Durning, estimates that per capita carbon emissions for white South Africans was more than 9 tons in 1987, compared to 5 tons for each American and an average of one ton per person worldwide. Durning based his South African estimates on the white's share of national income, since energy consumption patterns closely follow income distribution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the prosperity of white South Africans would have led to higher energy use in any case, Durning says that the extraordinarily large usage is part of a complex pattern resulting from the political and economic realities of white domination. &quot;Apartheid,&quot; he says, &quot;has distorted the nation's pattern of energy use as dramatically as its pattern of land ownership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's drive for energy self-sufficiency in the face of economic sanctions, and its isolation from its neighbors in the region, has made it dependent on coal for 85% of its commercial energy -- a ratio exceeded only in North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, low wages for the 85,000 black miners who dig the coal has kept electricity prices among the lowest in the world and encouraged wasteful usage. And the country's pioneering of synthetic fuels production -- using coal to make fuel oils -- is another energy-intensive project. Overall, South Africa uses twice as much energy to produce a dollar of economic product as the United States and four times as much as Japan, two other nations high on the world scale of energy consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal is not the only mineral South Africa has in abundance. The country is the world's major producer of gold, chromite and platinum and the second largest producer of manganese. It is third in production of uranium, fourth in antimony, fifth in diamonds, sixth in asbestos, seventh in nickel, eighth in iron ore, ninth in coal and eleventh in silver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But mineral riches can devastate the environment. &quot;For every ton of metal that leaves a mining operation's mill,&quot; the Worldwatch report says, &quot;about one hundred tons of wastes are left in a heap topside, where they can blow away on the winds, run off into rivers, or leach into groundwater.&quot; Apartheid has exacerbated the environmental destruction of mining, the report says. The high cost of maintaining apartheid has made the government dependent on large mining revenues and reluctant to police mining practices. The result has been massive pollution of soil, water and air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the short term, Durning says, blacks bear the major brunt of the hazards, including average deaths of two underground gold miners per day, asbestos-related diseases among both miners and their families, and the health effects of living downstream and downwind of the mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South African mining and energy policies contribute to global environmental threats on a scale completely out of proportion to the size of the nation's population and economy,&quot; says the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another environmental impact of apartheid identified by the report is the population density in South Africa's ten ethnic reserves. About half of South Africa's 28 million Africans are crowded into the rural reserves, whose fragile ecosystems make them more suited to rangeland than to subsistence agriculture. &quot;During World War I,&quot; Durning says, &quot;a government commission surveyed the agricultural carrying capacity of the small reserve of QwaQwa and estimated that the area was already overcrowded at 5000 inhabitants. Today, QwaQwa is home to more than 500,000 people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, nearly 90% of the graz-ing and cropland in the reserves are suffering &quot;unsustainable rates of soil loss,&quot; at the same time that hunger and malnutrition have mounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durning acknowledges that South Africa's ecological problems are hardly unique, and that modern history is full of societies that are squandering their land and poisoning their people. But he argues that political change could begin to reverse the damages that are a direct legacy of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he holds out some hope that a future South African government could combine a commitment to economic growth with a sensitivity to the environment. Already, environmental concerns have been raised by labor unions (see Africa News, April 30, 1990) and by community groups like the Soweto-based National Environmental Awareness Campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the national level, Max Sisulu, chief of economics and planning for the African National Congress and son of ANC leader Walter Sisulu, has pledged the ANC's commitment to sustaining the environment. In a policy statement last November, Sisulu said that &quot;environmental reconstruction constitutes a major task of a free and democratic post-apartheid South Africa.&quot; Among other measures he proposed, Sisulu called for the elimination of nuclear power, the promotion of solar energy, and a halt to the destruction of elephants and other wildlife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durning warns that &quot;bold words are easy for those out of power,&quot; and that a democratic South Africa will face the same immense challenges that other nations are confronting in the struggle to protect the earth. But by dismantling apartheid, he says, South Africans &quot;will automatically put an end to many of the sources of environmental degradation -- overcrowding in the homelands, over-reliance on coal, production of synthetic fuels, and scorched earth warfare against neighboring countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those countries, too, will feel an early impact from changes in South Africa. Already, the ten nations of the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) are discussing future relationships in the region. Among the possibilities are hydroelectric projects on rivers in SADCC states that could provide &quot;clean&quot; energy for South Africa plus revenues and energy for the producers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durning finds an additional sign of hope in the &quot;one quiet theme that cannot be suppressed&quot; despite the violence and bitterness of South African history -- the shared love of both black and white South Africans for the land itself. If thoughts of a greener future are optimistic, he concludes, neither are they idle speculation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-CA) convinced President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire to donate $ 250,000 to the Coalition for a Free Africa (CFA) more than two yearsago, the congressman says he was trying &quot;to do something positive to help Africa.&quot; (see Africa News, January 29, 1990) But his association with the Coalition has resulted in a spate of negative publicity, and last week Dymally gave up his seat on CFA's board of advisors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just didn't think it was worth the beating I was taking in the press to continue,&quot; Dymally told the Los Angeles Times. He says he and other black political figures have been unfairly targeted for criticism by white-owned media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dymally also resigned as chair of the Dymally Scholarship Fund, following newspaper accounts suggesting his positions in the two organizations represented a conflict of interest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coalition for a Free Africa was established in 1986 by Richard Griffey, the president of Solar Records in Hollywood, &quot;to provide relief for victims of apartheid and African famine,&quot; according to the articles of incorporation filed with the California secretary of state. A year ago, CFA held a telethon to raise funds for South African children. The event was more successful in generating publicity than revenue, according to Virgil Roberts, Solar's general counsel. Roberts says Mobutu's $ 250,000 is the only major funding CFA has received, aside from some $ 300,000 donated by Griffey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dymally has acknowledged helping Griffey, a friend and campaign contributor, to obtain a $ 12 million oil contract with the Angolan government. He also tried to persuade the Uganda government to do business with another friend, Mamadi Diane, a Washington, D.C.-based food broker who arranged the congressman's first trip to Zaire in 1988. Dymally's expenses for the trip -- which included stops in Angola, Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana -- were paid by CFA and the Zaire government. CFA also paid &quot;out-of-pocket&quot; expenses for a subsequent Dymally trip to Brazil to accept an award for Nelson Mandela on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diane heads the Zaire-American Research Institute, which promotes that country's cause in the U.S. and has received most of its funding from Zaire businessmen with close ties to Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accounts of various aspects of Dymally's activities have appeared over the past year in Africa News, Business Week, the Christian Science Monitor, Journal of Commerce, Legal Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post. But the congressman has faced constant criticism from the newspaper of the New Alliance, a left-leaning political party which unsuccessfully fielded a candidate against Dymally in last week's California primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alliance, which has been waging a vigorous campaign against Mobutu, has excoriated Dymally for his support of the Zaire leader. Charges of misconduct against the congressman have been raised repeatedly in the newspaper. And the U.S.-Congo Friendship Committee, which has close ties to National Alliance, filed an ethics complaint against Dymally with the Committee on Official Standards of Conduct of the House of Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, another organization closely associated with the Alliance, the Rainbow Lobby, has mobilized pressure on Congress to cut off aid to Zaire. The Lobby has attacked Dymally for refusing to join in the criticisms of Mobutu that have been raised by other Black Caucus members and by liberal Democrats Stephen Solarz and David Obey, as well as Howard Wolpe, who chairs the House Africa subcommittee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dymally's resignation from the scholarship fund follows a Washington Post report in January. The article suggested that the congressman had withdrawn his opposition to diamond sanctions against South Africa after the fund received a $ 34,200 contribution from Maurice Tempelsman, a New York diamond merchant who lobbied Dymally on the bill. The scholarship fund finances study trips to Puerto Rico for minority high school students from Dymally's Congressional district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Tempelsman and Dymally denied that the contribution was related to the sanctions deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dymally says his shift in position on diamonds came as a result of a plea from the South African diamond-producing country of Botswana and was supported by other sanctions supporters, including Wolpe. The original measure, which was part of the proposed 1988 sanctions bill that would have cut all trade links with South Africa, would have banned the import of diamonds of unidentifiable origin, as well as those designated as coming from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tempelsman, who says he has supported South African sanctions, told Africa News that &quot;a blanket inclusion of diamonds in sanctions legislation -- because &cent;diamonds/ normally arrive indistinguishable as to national origin -- would unfairly penalize not only U.S. importers but also such non-South African producers as Botswana.&quot; The government of Botswana, in a letter to Dymally, said the proposed ban &quot;would have the potential to destroy&quot; its economy &quot;without producing any noticeable effect on South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After separate meetings with Botswana officials and with Tempelsman, Dymally agreed to remove the diamond ban and replace it with a provision calling for a study of the diamond industry that is intended to pressure diamond traders into segregating diamonds by country of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolpe says the suggestion that Tempelsman's intervention was the reason for the change in language &quot;is simply untrue.&quot; The bill as now drafted bans the import of South African diamonds and &quot;expresses clearly the intent of Congress that effective and rigorus enforcement measures would be required,&quot; Wolpe says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos -- The alluring white paint of the one-story building seems out of place in its surroundings in Ajegunle, a sprawling slum suburb on the outskirts of Lagos. Emblazoned on its entrance are the words &quot;People's Bank of Nigeria. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In front of the building, Mustapha Sanusi, a carpenter, jostles for a place on the queue with hundreds of other artisans and small scale traders waiting to collect application forms for loans from the bank. &quot;I need the N500 (500 naira - about $ 60) to buy equipment to complete a job I'm doing,&quot; says Sanusi, who cannot read or write. He could not get a loan from a commercial bank because he could provide no collateral and besides, the money he needed was &quot;too small.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Sanusi turned to the People's Bank, a grassroots financial institution owned by the government and targeted at the poorest Nigerians who live below the poverty line. Ibrahim Babangida, the country's military ruler, says the bank is an indirect scheme &quot;for income generation and income redistribution&quot; among the country's poor, many of whom cannot get credit from commercial banks for reasons similar to Sanusi's.  The People's Bank gives out minimum loans of $ 6 (N50), and the maximum it can lend is $255 (N2,000). No collateral is needed. Apart from a service fee of five percent, no interest is charged. Payments begin two weeks after the loan is taken, and the total repayment period is one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the People's Bank has lent $ 2 million to 9,000 poor artisans, small scale farmers and entrepreneurs. Nigeria's poorest citizens, who are the Bank's clientele, have borne the heaviest burden of the economic Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) started by Babangida's government in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stringent reform measures have weakened the purchasing power of the country's currency, and led to deteriorating living standards. The naira has been devalued by 80%. Subsidies on fuel and utilities have been withdrawn, prompting price increases in all sectors of the economy. But the minimum wage still remains at its pre-SAP level of $ 6 (N125) a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this backdrop, the People's Bank -- which started last October and already has branches in most of Nigeria's 21 states -- is seen as a godsend by poor Nigerians. &quot;I can't believe this,&quot; says a smiling Cecelia Idong, a tailor and mother of five children who borrowed $ 25 (N1,000). &quot;The loan has given my business the boost it so badly needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tai Solarin, a leftist government critic who has been appointed the bank's chairman, says he is happy that &quot;the government has realized that structures operating in the country have not served the purpose of the ordinary people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks that exclusively serve the poor have been successful in India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Nigeria's People's Bank seems to be inspired by the success of Bangladesh's Grameen (Rural) Bank, which operates in over 7,000 Bangladeshi villages and serves the banking needs of about 300,000 households in the country's rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the rave reviews that have welcomed the &quot;poor man's bank&quot; here, the scheme is not without problems, and it has its critics. &quot;How do you make it self-sustaining, or is it supposed to be a Father Christmas?&quot; asks Claude Esekody, a Shell Oil Company management trainee. Most analysts here do not think the bank should be run as a charity. But they stress that by its very nature, the new financial institution has to be unorthodox in its methods.  &quot;Banking for the poor is 'social banking.' The profit motive is not the driving force,&quot; says O.B.A. Obanla, an economic analyst in Lagos. Ade Ojo, dean of the business school at the University of Lagos, says the People's Bank is just a &quot;gimmick&quot; to pacify poor Nigerians who are feeling the pinch of the SAP. Ojo says there is no &quot;authoritative&quot; proof of the bank's viability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major criticism of the concept is that the minimum and maximum lending range of $ 6 to $255 is too small to help many small scale businesses.  Government officials say they hope to extend the lending ceiling in the coming years and that the small sums being disbursed have clearly helped many poor individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another fear has been that repayment defaults by loan recipients would make the bank unviable and lead to its collapse. But Bola Ajibola, Attorney-General and Minister of Justice disagrees. &quot;The poor people are more honest than the rich,&quot; he says. &quot;The percentage of loan repayment will be higher than in our normal banks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the figures support Ajibola. An excellent repayment rate of 113 percent has been recorded by the banks. Bank officials report that although $ 25,000 (N200,000) was due to be repaid within the first month of its existence, the beneficiaries repaid $ 31,000 (N250,000). &quot;It's amazing,&quot; says Maria Sokenu, the bank's national coordinator. &quot;The rate of repayment is fantastic.&quot; Sokenu says many loan beneficiaries don't take the allotted year for full repayment &quot;because they know that as soon as they pay back, they become eligible for a bigger loan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The low default rate is due partly to the People's Bank's lending procedures. To get a loan, applicants must belong to a trade or professional group of fifteen persons. It is the group that recommends to the bank which of its members should get a loan first. The group is an informal guarantor because the rest of them will not receive any loans until the beneficiary starts paying back on schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impressed with the bank's initial success, Babangida has approved an extra $ 25 million for its activities. The bank plans to establish 170 new bran-ches this year alone. Its success has attracted the attention of the African Development Bank (ADB), which plans to inject funds into it soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to expanding its support for the People's Bank, the Nigerian government is planning to set up &quot;community banks&quot; in rural areas. It will provide initial capital for the bank's start-up, but unlike the People's Bank, the equity capital for community banks will come mostly from villagers who will be required, as they are by the People's Bank, to form themselves into groups for securing loans. Together with a rural banking scheme which the Central Bank of Nigeria started in 1977, the People's Bank and the community banks are designed to take care of the credit needs of Nigeria's rural and urban poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists here say that banking for the poor is &quot;an economic imperative&quot; for a developing country such as Nigeria, where most of the population live below the poverty line. The essence of the People's Bank, says analyst Obanla, is the recognition that economic opportunities for the poor must be expanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1023 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National University of Zaire at Lubumbashi (UNZL), where an unknown number of students were massacred by government troops, is a once-thriving institution that now has neither toilets nor textbooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although NZL is one of three institutions at the top of Zaire's educational system, physical conditions are so abysmal that it resembles a war zone, especially since no one has yet removed the scars of the last war fought in this spot, 30 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven-story administration building, constructed as a whites-only hospital in the era of Belgian colonialism, served as headquarters for United Nations peacekeeping troops during the civil strife of the post-independence period. The structure still bears the traces of those bullets, and the subsequent decades of decay have littered the grounds with the wreckage of vehicles for which there are no spare parts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dormitories, whose 5000 residents are packed into a space built for 1900, could be a refugee center, where the half-starved students live on one bowl of porridge a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students and teachers suffer together through classes under the blazing heat of the central African sun, because soldiers from the three military barracks that surround the university have stolen many of the classrooms' corrugated tin roofs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there's a bright side to the missing roofs. Although the classrooms become unusable during the rains, in dry weather the rooflessness makes for better lighting, compensating for the lack of electric fixtures and the power outages that plunge the campus into periodic darkness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, power failures are less serious for studies than they might be elsewhere, since students do little reading at night -- textbooks are rare and the library contains almost nothing published in the last 20 years. A Rockefeller Foundation grant to replenish the collection was stolen before it could be used. Zaire, says a foundation official, is &quot;one of the rare places where we have felt compelled to declare failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle to eat preoccupies both students and teachers, constantly impeding their tenacious efforts to study and to teach. Everyone would starve without resorting to some sort of supplemental income. Students sometimes steal light bulbs and desks for resale. Teachers hold other jobs, and some -- apparently a disreputable minority -- extort money from students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State neglect has made the educational decline inevitable. Although UNZL is in Zaire's southeastern Shaba province, one of Africa's most mineral-rich regions, the school's operating budget, outside of salaries and scholarships, was only $ 16,000 a year in 1987 -- less than the price of one of the chauffeured Mercedes-Benzes that whisk top government officials through the streets of the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faculty and staff salaries are paid separately by the central government, but the money is often late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The university's poverty is both a product and a symptom of the underfinancing of the entire educational system. Since UNZL was founded in 1955 as a school for the white colonial elite, physical conditions have deteriorated dramatically. &quot;We ate three meals a day in the dining halls and maids washed our clothes and cleaned our rooms,&quot; says one of the first black students to study there in 1959. Even in the 1970s, the campus was clean and there was a good dining hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People familiar with the school say things began to change after the Mobutu government nationalized the universities in 1971, and that the decline accelerated a few years later when the price of copper -- Zaire's major revenue earner -- collapsed on the world market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the dining halls are closed and malnutrition is increasingly widespread. Rest is elusive for students packed four or five to a tiny room.  Teachers say tired, hungry students often fall asleep in class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions are so grim that those who knew UNZL in better years are amazed that it still exists at all. &quot;They should simply shut down until the government gets serious about education and is prepared to spend some money on reconstruction,&quot; says a 1979 graduate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the difficulties, education and scholarship somehow survive and sometimes thrive. The estimated one out of six students who survive the five year course of study can &quot;match the best at Harvard and Yale,&quot; insists a professor who studied in the United States. &quot;If a Zairean tells you he's an architect,&quot; says a 1986 architecture graduate from the university in Kinshasa, &quot;you know he's a very strong man who survived an impossible ordeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A surprising number of faculty members have given up comfortable positions abroad to teach in Zaire. And while they haven't been able to criticize President Mobutu by name, university-based scholars have produced many of the most sophisticated studies on the roots of hunger, unemployment and agricultural stagnation. Graduate students and university teachers have developed strategies for &quot;participatory research,&quot; working directly with peasants and the urban poor to develop ways to found cooperatives, increase food production and meet other basic needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers are closely watched, though, whether Zairean or foreign. Last year a Belgian university lecturer was expelled from the country for putting two studies of an opposition party in a university faculty library.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the few Zaireans who will be quoted is UNZL economic historian Tshibangu Kabel Musasa. &quot;Simply teaching the truth,&quot; he says, &quot;is enough to get in trouble.&quot; Trouble is something he knows well. Arrested three times during the 1980s, he nearly lost an eye during severe police beatings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students have proved the hardest critics to silence, keeping alive a tradition of spontaneous protest, if not organized opposition. But even complaints about poor living and study conditions is to risk imprisonment or death. Still, each new student generation has included some who are daring enough to test the limits of dissent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC. -- In the wake of an apparent massacre of student protestors, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire is facing a crisis of confidence among the international supporters that have kept him in power since 1965.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests are spreading in several parts of the country, fueled by reports that government soldiers murdered between 50 and 100 university students in Lubumbashi last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strikes have reportedly shut down Gecamines, the state-owned mining company that is Zaire's major employer and largest export earner. Protests have also closed schools across the country. Student demonstrations were reported in major towns from the capital Kinshasa to Mbanza-Ngungu in the west to Mbandaka in the north and Mbuji-Mayi in the central region. Among the others reported to be on strike or staging slow downs are doctors in Kinshasa and other cities, who last week defied a government order to return to work, Reuters reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the killings, which have made headlines in the European press, sparked a call for an international inquiry from the 12-nation European Community. The EC appeal was made at the request of Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler, which retains an extensive stake in the country's economy.  Brussels has suspended new loans and aid programs to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, which in the past has sent troops to prop up the Zaire government, announced the indefinite postponement of a scheduled cabinet-level visit to the country by officials planning next year's Francophone summit, scheduled to meet in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, where Mobutu was welcomed a year ago as the mediator of Angola's 13-year old civil war, new questions are being raised about his reliability as an ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire is currently the largest recipient of American aid in sub-Saharan Africa. But the reports of student slayings are expected to accelerate Congressional attempts to cut the military aid and restrict economic assistance (see Africa News, April 30, 1990).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any cut in U.S. assistance would be important. Washington has been Mobutu's chief supporter since he seized control in a CIA-backed coup 25 years ago. Administration officials privately acknowledge his continuing usefulness as a funnel for covert U.S. aid to rebels fighting the Marxist Angolan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zaire unrest comes in the aftermath of Mobutu's April 24 announcement of political reforms, including a promise to end one-party control. But a widespread crackdown on dissenters since the announcement seems to have propelled the current protests to new heights. The level of nationwide activism reported in recent days is unprecedented in a country where independent trade unions and student movements have been banned since the late 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mobutu seems to have unleashed the deadliest of his security forces against his people,&quot; says Makau wa Mutua, an attorney with the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, who has made two recent visits to the country and is preparing a report on the human rights situation there. &quot;No one can remember such a concentrated period of repression in Zaire in recent times,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the crackdown, the opposition has been emboldened, Mutua says.  He recounts a June 3 incident where one leader of the opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress fired a pistol in the air when security police tried to break up a meeting at his home.  The oppositionist was subsequently arrested. Mutua says it seems that people formerly cowed by Mobutu's security apparatus are saying, &quot;To hell with it, we're just going to speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One measure of the unusual nature of recent events in Zaire is the account broadcast on May 28 -- the day the Gecamines strikes began -- by the local, government-run radio station in Lubumbashi, where the mining company's operations are centered. With unaccustomed frankness, the radio that Gecamines employees &quot;did not go to work this morning.&quot; The station also said that in Likasi, another key mining center, &quot;shops, public and private firms, and &cent;government/ departments did not open their doors&quot; and &quot;markets closed shortly after having opened.&quot; The newscast reported that schools failed to reopen as scheduled after a holiday break, despite repeated requests &quot;by the urban authorities in a communique broadcast many times on our radio this morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first reports of the Lubumbashi killings appeared in the Brussels daily, Le Soir. Accounts have also been carried in Libre Belgique and the French newspaper Le Monde.  The stories say commandos from the Special Presidential Division -- an elite unit recruited from Mobutu's home region and trained by Israeli advisors -- were dispatched from Kinshasa to the Lubumbashi campus, bearing lists of suspected anti-government activists. On the night of May 11, the accounts say, the troops sealed off the university, cut electric lines, assaulted students with knives and bayonets, and set fire to dormitory rooms. A statement issued May 30 by nine Zairean opposition parties and organizations charged that at least 63 people died during the police action.  The raid was believed to be a reprisal for student attacks on suspected campus police agents. Lubumbashi students have charged that the agents were responsible for the disappearance and presumed death of 23 of their fellow students in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The siege of the campus follows a year of escalating challenges to the Mobutu regime -- often led by students -- accompanied by reprisals against the dissidents. Soldiers and police last year killed an unknown number of young people - estimates range from four to more than three dozen - during protests in Lubumbashi and in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. State Department formally noted the reported killings &quot;with concern&quot; and called for an independent investigation. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman Cohen was in Kinshasa late last month after the incident occurred, but before it received much notice in the foreign press.  A State Department official declined to say whether Cohen discussed the incident with Zairean officials. The Department also says it can confirm no reports to counter the Zaire government claim that only one student died in the violence, which it blamed on &quot;faction fighting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While developing countries as a whole have made significant progress towards human development, as measured by improved literacy rates, lower infant mortality rates and access to primary health care, African poverty is on the increase. The United Nations Development Program's recently released Human Development Report says that any international effort to tackle global social problems must give priority to Africa, where almost two-thirds of the people are below the poverty line. Long-term adjustment strategies, says the UNDP, must be adopted to rebuild African economies, and an overwhelming share of the international community's concessional resources must be earmarked for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the report concludes that the practice of measuring development by per capita wealth fails to reveal true human advancement. A nation may be experiencing economic growth, but have social indicators below the average, as in the case of Senegal. Likewise, some nations with low economic performance such as Tanzania, do better than others in providing health and education to their people, the report says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To adjust for these discrepancies, the report calls for new standards.  In particular, military expenditures, which in some countries are three times that of health and education spending combined, should be substantially reduced, and governments should balance economic considerations more equally with social ones, UNDP says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WORKERS RIGHTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan is among four countries cited by Americas Watch, a human rights monitor, for violating international labor rights. The other countries are El Salvador, Guatemala and Colombia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rights organization has criticized the U.S. government for continuing preferential trade with the four countries. It also has submitted petitions to the U.S. Trade Representative calling for a suspension of benefits to the countries named until workers rights improve significantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following last year's military coup, the Sudanese government banned all independent trade unions and arrested at least 200 workers, some of whom say they were tortured while in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIDS HOPE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anti-AIDS drug Kemron, developed in Kenya, has shown promising results in a recent study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers in five African countries Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire, Congo, Zimbabwe and Cameroon took part in the study. WHO plans to expand the study to include an additional six African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, the Kenya Medical Research Institute announced that it had developed a drug capable of reversing some of the symptoms of the lethal disease. Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has announced that Kemron will be distributed locally and internationally as early as this August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALL THAT GLITTERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia officially opened its first gold mine since the coun-try's independence last April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Navachab gold mine, whose major shareholder is South Africa's Anglo-American Corporation, is thought to be the first significant open-cast gold mine in southern Africa and is expected to produce two tons of gold a year, equivalent to $ 25 million at today's rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sam Nujoma, speaking at the opening ceremony, reaffirmed his government's commitment to a mixed economy saying that the aim is to ensure reasonable returns on investment and adequate revenue for the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DESERT DIALOGUE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar plans to call a Security Council meeting for later this month to discuss the peace process in Western Sahara, Africa News has learned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has set up an Identification Commission to determine who is eligible to vote in a referendum to decide the fate of the disputed territory.  In early June, the commission called a meeting in Geneva of 38 Saharan dignitaries to discuss the poll. Nineteen of the leaders reside in camps along the Algerian border run by Polisario, the Saharan independence movement, and the others live in Moroccan-held territory. At the Geneva meeting, mediated by the Secretary General's special representative for the Western Sahara, Johannes J. Manz, it was agreed that a 1974 Spanish census will provide a guideline for allot-ting voting rights, but that others, omitted from that census, must be included.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRIALS AND TALKS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four Liberian government soldiers were brought to trial last week for the killings of several prominent civilians in a suburb of the capital, Monrovia. The government of President Samuel Doe encouraged foreign journalists to attend the court-martial, attempting to deflect criticism that the government has tolerated or even encouraged the recent spate of civilian murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While one army source confirmed that the government wants a &quot;speedy trial&quot; to make an example of the defendants, presiding judge Col. Isaac Nyeplu grudgingly stalled the trial to honor the defendants' request for civilian lawyers. Human rights groups have condemned the Doe government in the past for trial violations and summary executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the trial began, fighting between the government and the rebel National Patriotic Front dwindled, while the two sides concluded initial peace talks in neighboring Sierra Leone. The atmosphere at the talks was &quot;courteous and understanding,&quot; said a spokesperson for the Liberian Council of Churches, which mediated the sessions. Although the two sides are deadlocked over the rebel demand that President Doe resign, they have promised to meet again on June 25.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pluralist situation would be a new experience for both Angolan parties, accustomed as they are to tight control over information and intolerance of public criticism. Savimbi's supporters believe his reputed charisma would give him the edge over the more low-key Angolan president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Savimbi has vulnerabilities that are not often examined in the generally-positive press coverage he receives. One recent indication was the charges of human rights abuses raised by former followers, charges given extra weight when they were reported by a British journalist, Fred Bridgland, who earlier authored an uncritical biography of the Unita leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may be other chinks in Savimbi's armor as well, according to a recent study by William Minter, an American sociologist whose books include King Solomon's Mines Revisited and Operation Timber: Pages from the Savimbi Dossier, a critical examination of the Unita leader's alleged cooperation with colonial Portugal's secret police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minter says Unita's recruitment methods for the past decade have involved the use of both conscription and the abduction of youths in battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is widely recognized that government conscription may have created discontent in many parts of the country. &quot;But it is often assumed that an insurgent movement like Unita operates principally by mobilizing volunteers,&quot; Minter writes. &quot;In the 1980s, this was clearly not the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minter bases his findings on six weeks of interviews last year with 16 ex-participants in Unita and on a compilation of first-hand accounts by visitors to Unita areas -- part of a larger research project on insurgency in post-colonial Angola and Mozambique. He has described his conclusions in a 20-page report and in an article in the current issue of Africa Report, published by the African-American Institute in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minter says Unita has provided &quot;rudimentary health and education services&quot; to the populations in areas they control, but has &quot;aimed at making life physically impossible for civilians who decide to stay in government areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 1989 Africa Watch report accuses Unita of mining fields and roads to reduce food output in government-held regions. The Angolan population is said to have the highest number of amputees per capita in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But MPLA could expect to face electoral dissatisfaction over failed economic policies, since not all the hardships can be blamed on the lengthy war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government might also be hampered by divisions within its leadership ranks. Differences over key policy questions, including the terms of an acceptable settlement with Savimbi, are believed by some analysts to be the reason why dos Santos has twice postponed a meeting of the central committee, now scheduled for June 27. These analysts believe the president is hoping to conclude a cease-fire agreement before that session, to avoid being shackled with new preconditions that might make an agreement more difficult.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC -- Amid rising hopes for a cease-fire in Angola's bloody civil war, a new struggle is looming in Congress over administration plans to boost covert assistance to the rebel movement Unita, led by Jonas Savimbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The developments come in the wake of what is being called the largest battle of the 13-year-long conflict -- four months of fighting centered around the strategic town of Mavinga in the southeast of the country. Angolan observers believe both sides have suffered huge losses, with casualties possibly amounting to thousands of soldiers and civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new effort to end U.S. funding of Unita is being spearheaded by a coalition of African-American organizations coordinated by TransAfrica. &quot;It's a disgraceful policy, contributing to a war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives,&quot; says Randall Robinson, TransAfrica's executive director. The coalition hopes to generate the same kind of public outcry that was sparked by TransAfrica-led demonstrations at the South African embassy a few years ago.  &quot;We believe most Americans will oppose the carnage we are financing in Angola,&quot; Robinson says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration is supplying Unita with about $ 50 million a year in aid; the exact amount is classified. But an additional amount -- believed to total about $ 15 million -- is being &quot;reprogrammed&quot; within the covert action budget in response to a Unita request for increased assistance due to the recent heavy fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the Congressional Black Caucus asked the chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to &quot;reject all attempts to allow U.S.  resources to enter this war region.&quot; A letter from Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-CA), who chairs the 24-member group, called aid to Unita &quot;morally indefensible&quot; and &quot;disruptive to global efforts to stabilize the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. supplies to Unita proved &quot;very effective&quot; during the long battle, Savimbi told reporters in Mavinga last month. He said American-made 106 mm recoilless rifles mounted on Toyota Land Cruisers proved potent against Soviet-built tanks and artillery used by the Angolan army. The CIA has been airlifting ammunition, boots, Toyota parts and fuel to Unita via Zaire, informed sources say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolan army, known as Fapla, made an unexpectedly rapid drive southward in January and occupied Mavinga on February 2. The advance put Fapla within 20 miles of the Unita headquarters at Jamba, but also stretched government communication links and supply lines to untested lengths. Fighting in and around Mavinga continued for three months, until Fapla pulled back from the town on May 6 and 7, following a heavy engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report from Mavinga on South African television last week called it &quot;one of the biggest battles in Africa since World War II.&quot; It was the first time since Angolan independence in 1977 that Unita had been without South African air cover and supply lines and that Fapla had fought without the logistical backing of Cuban troops. Under the terms of the 1988 tri-partite peace accord which resulted in independence for Namibia, Angola's southern neighbor, South Africa agreed to stop aiding Unita, and Cuba agreed to a phased withdrawal of 50,000 troops from Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he government pull-back from Mavinga came ten days after the first face-to-face talks between government and Unita representatives, who met in Portugal on April 24 and 25. The government said its troops were being redeployed from Mavinga to counter Unita activities in other parts of the country. In recent weeks, there has been heavy fighting in southcentral Angola to the west of Mavinga and in several areas in the north near the Zaire border. Unita has also sabotaged power lines that supply electricity to the capital Luanda, creating frequent power outages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 5, the government announced another withdrawal of forces -- those engaged in a drive south towards the Namibian border. Angola's UN envoy, Manuel Pedro Pacavira, called the move a &quot;goodwill gesture&quot; designed to signal to Unita and the United States his govern-ment's commitment to peace. He said the pull-back from Mavinga a month earlier had also been intended to promote prospects for a settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cease-fire hopes have been renewed with the news that the two parties are meeting again under Portuguese government auspices, each having expressed a desire for an agreement. In communiques issued immediately after the April talks, Unita formally recognized the Angolan state and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos as head of state -- conditions Luanda demanded for further contacts. In return, Unita demanded recognition as &quot;an official opposition&quot; and asked for a meeting between dos Santos and Savimbi in Portugal or in Kinshasa, Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unita has called for the replace-ment of the current single-party system with a multi-party govern-ment chosen in free elections. Dos Santos' ruling MPLA Workers Party has recently pledged to hold elections in which non-party candidates -- including members of Unita -- can run for seats in the national assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Marxist government has also moved away from a centrally-managed economy and introduced a series of reform measures designed to promote the expansion of the private sector and attract foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview last month on Egyptian television, dos Santos said similar steps towards political liberalization are in the works. &quot;We want to expand democracy in the party, society, and state,&quot; he said. The question of a one-party versus a multi-party state will be debated at the party's upcoming third congress, although any &quot;sudden change&quot; to a pluralistic structure would be &quot;dangerous and disastrous,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dos Santos said he expected the reforms to result in &quot;greater understanding&quot; of Angola on the part of Western governments, a point he did not elaborate in the interview. But Luanda has expressed disappointment that the changes have not brought a softening of the American position. Angolan officials had hoped that after they implemented the main Reagan administration precondition for relations -- the withdrawal of Cuban forces -- the U.S. would normalize relations and end assistance for Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current American prescription for Angola links the question of aiding Unita to the successful conclusion of a peace agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robinson and leaders of major civil rights organizations have been lobbying for an aid cut-off in meetings with Baker and the Senate and House Democratic leadership. Robinson says the Democratic Party, with majorities in both Houses, has to share the blame for the current policy, which he termed &quot;an affront to African-Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the effort to garner opposition to continued Unita funding, Dellums is planning to lead a fact-finding mission to Angola by Black Caucus members to assess the current situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of Democrats already support an aid cut-off. &quot;The end of the Cold War ought to be the nail in the coffin of U.S. support for Unita,&quot; Sen.  Edward Kennedy (D-MA) said late last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many Democrats have been reluctant to take a position that could be interpreted as helpful to a Marxist-led government. Several members have sought instead to convince the administration to strike a deal with the Soviets to cut off all aid to both sides -- the so called &quot;zero-zero&quot; option -- an idea Soviet diplomats floated several months ago. But Baker said last week that such an approach would be acceptable only as part of a comprehensive peace accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi and Unita still enjoy bipartisan backing in Congress, and their position is strengthened by an aggressive lobbying effort directed by the public relations firm Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly (see Africa News, November 1989).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way to bring the MPLA to the table for talks is to make the military option impossible,&quot; says Jardo Muekalia, Unita's Washington representative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one of his dramatic accounts of African travels, Henry Morton Stanley describes a trip up the Congo River in the 1870s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 2 p.m. we emerged out of the shelter of the deeply wooded banks and came into a vast stream, nearly 2,000 yards across at the mouth. . . . Looking upstream, we saw a sight that sent the blood tingling through every nerve and fiber of our bodies: a flotilla of giant canoes bearing down on us. . . . I gave the order to drop anchor. We had sufficient time to take a view of the mighty force bearing down on us and to count the number of war vessels. There were 52 of them! A monster canoe led the way, with two rows of upstanding paddles, 40 men on a side, their bodies bending and swaying in unison as with a swelling barbarous chorus they drove her down towards us. . . .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crashing sound of large drums, a hundred blasts from ivory horns, and a thrilling chant from 2,000 human throats did not tend to sooth our nerves or to increase our confidence. We had no time to pray or to take sentimental looks at the savage world, or even to breath a sad farewell to it. So many other things had to be done speedily and well. . . . Every sound was soon lost in the rippling, crackling musketry. For five minutes we were so absorbed in firing that we took no note of anything else... Our blood was up now. We therefore lifted our anchors and pursued them upstream along the right bank until, rounding a point, we saw their villages. We made straight for the bank and con-tinued the fight in the village streets with those who had landed, hunting them out into the woods, and there sounded the retreat, having returned the daring cannibals the compliment of a visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a world culture series book, Through African Eyes, published by the Center for International Training and Education, editor Leon Clark reprints a description of the same event by an African chief called Mojimba, as told to Catholic missionary, Father Joseph Fraessle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When we heard that the man with the white flesh was journeying down the Lualaba &cent;Congo/ we were open-mouthed with astonishment. We stood still. All night long the drums announced the strange news -- a man with white flesh. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will prepare a feast, I ordered, we will go to meet our brother and escort him into the village with rejoicing! We donned our ceremonial garb. We assembled the great canoes. . . . We swept forward, my canoe leading, the others following, to meet the first white man our eyes had beheld and to do him honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as we drew near his canoes there were loud reports, bang! bang!  and fire-staves spat bits of iron at us. We were paralyzed with fright; our mouths hung wide open and we could not shut them. Some screamed dreadfully, others were silent -- they were dead and blood flowed from little holes in their bodies. &quot;War! that is war!&quot; I yelled. &quot;Go back!&quot; The canoes sped back to our village with all the strength our spirits could impart to our arms. That was no brother! That was the worst enemy our country had ever seen. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They came after us. We flung ourselves into the forest and flung ourselves on the ground. When we returned that evening our eyes beheld fearful things: our village plundered and burned and the water full of dead bodies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who doubts that scholarship is culturally biased has only to read Valentin Mudimbe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After citing such examples as the 1965 comment of Mary Kingsley that the &quot;African has never made an even fourteenth-rate piece of cloth or pottery,&quot; Mudimbe muses on the convoluted formulas that Westerners have had to devise to avoid challenges to their belief in African inferiority. &quot;Since Africans could produce nothing of value,&quot; he says, &quot;the technique of Yoruba statuary must have come from the Egyptians; Benin art must be a Portuguese creation; the architectural achievement of Zimbabwe was due to Arab technicians; and Hausa and Buganda statecraft were inventions of white invaders.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bringing his examples up-to-date, Mudimbe uses the case of popular astronomer Carl Sagan. The Cornell professor has expressed his astonishment at the sophisticated cosmology of the Dogon people of Mali, whose traditional views of the universe go beyond a belief in planets that rotate upon their axes, a Saturn encircled by a ring, and elliptical, rather than circular, planetary orbits -- in contrast, Sagan says, &quot;to almost all prescientific societies.&quot;Sagan notes that the Dogon also postulate an invisible, dark companion to the star Sirius which orbits it once every fifty years and is made of a metal not found on earth. &quot;The remarkable fact,&quot; Sagan writes, &quot;is that the visible star does have an extraordinary dark companion, Sirius B which orbits it in an elliptical orbit once each 50.04 years,&quot; made of a metallic matter which does not exist on earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sagan, unable to credit that the first &quot;white dwarf star discovered by modern astrophysics&quot; could have been known already to Africans, proposes European visitor -- &quot;a diplomat, an explorer, an adventurer or an early anthropologist&quot; -- who carried news of the discovery to the Dogon, sometime after a 1928 book on the density of white dwarfs was published. Mudimbe persuasively debunks that hypothesis with a survey of historical Dogon rituals that incorporate the Sirius beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In brief,&quot; Mudimbe summarizes, &quot;although presented in the second part of the twentieth century, Carl Sagan's hypothesis belongs to nineteenth-century reasoning about 'primitives' . . . namely, the belief that scientifically there is nothing to be learned from 'them' unless it is already 'ours' or comes from 'us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Mudimbe's earlier works, both fiction and non-fiction, this book challenges the foundations of much Western scholarship. Of some of the eighteenth century journals and records that raise issues upon which twentieth century anthropology focuses, Mudimbe asserts that they &quot;speak about neither Africa nor Africans, but rather justify the process of inventing and conquering a continent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argues that anthropological science was rooted in the framework of mercantilist ideology, in which colonies' only value was the benefits they brought to the mother country. Fueled by a sense of the &quot;inherent superiority of the white race&quot; and a drive to expand to &quot;virgin areas&quot; of the world, empires were built. Anthropological studies gave a scientific imprimatur to the concept of Africans as &quot;primitive&quot; that justified colonialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who doubts that scholarship can be culturally biased has only to read Valentin Mudimbe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After citing such examples as a comment in the 1965 reissue of Mary Kingsley's nineteenth century book Travels in West Africa that the &quot;African has never made an even fourteenth-rate piece of cloth or pottery,&quot; Mudimbe muses on the convoluted formulas that Westerners have devised to avoid challenges to their belief in African inferiority. Since sub-Saharan Africans could produce nothing of value, he says, &quot;the technique of Yoruba statuary must have come from the Egyptians; Benin art must be a Portuguese creation; the architectural achievement of Zimbabwe was due to Arab technicians; and Hausa and Buganda statecraft were inventions of white invaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Negative images of Africa have a lingering persistence. And nowhere are they more powerful than in descriptions of Zaire, the former Belgian Congo and setting for Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. With its equatorial climate, its luxuriant rain forests and its larger-than-life strongman ruler, Zaire still evokes Conradian associations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its December 4, 1964 issue, Time magazine reported on an uprising in what is now Zaire's Shaba province. &quot;The rebels were, after all,&quot; the magazine said, &quot;only a rabble of dazed ignorant savages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Shaba exploded again in 1978, Walter Cronkite opened the 6:30 p.m. feed of the CBS evening news for May 19 with these words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good evening. The worst fears in the rebel invasion of Zaire's Shaba province reportedly have been realized. Rebels being routed from the mining town of Kolwezi are reported to have killed a number of Euro-peans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obviously, somebody had goofed. By the 7:00 p.m. feed, the lead had been rewritten to avoid the suggestion that white deaths were the worst possible development in a war whose casualties were overwhelmingly black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the earlier version typified the agitated tone that prevailed in hundreds of newspapers and radio stations across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rebel tribesmen on a rampage of murder and rape slaughtered as many as 200 persons in a 'hunt for the white man,'&quot; screamed the Associated Press.  &quot;Rebel troops went into a frenzy of killing and looting in which they massacred at least 150 whites,&quot; said UPI. Front page stories in the Washington Post held rebels responsible for &quot;what may turn out to have been the worst massacre of Europeans in modern African history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when passions cooled, and criticism by Africanists began to mount, discomfited reporters realized that the number of white casualties were far lower than the early reports suggested and that most of the killings appeared to have been random. As many whites seemed to have been killed by government soldiers as by insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In retrospect,&quot; said the Post's David Ottaway in a May 28 analysis that was buried deep in the paper, &quot;it seems some of the initial reports from French and Zairean sources of whites being massacred were deliberately exaggerated to gain quick Western public sympathy&quot; for the French-Belgium airlift of troops into the province. &quot;As for the rebels,&quot; Ottaway said, &quot;there are many reports of their commanders acting to protect whites rather than ordering their execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a decade later, the U.S. media is all but silent on Zaire.  Even the killings of between 60 and 150 Zaire university students by government troops in May 1990 -- reported widely in the European press and prompting a Belgian cut-off of aid and loans -- went almost unnoticed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've gotten old and cynical enough to say that this is normal,&quot; says University of North Carolina historian David Newbury. A Zaire specialist, Newbury sent off dozens of information packets to newspapers and television stations in an unsuccessful effort to stir some interest in the growing conflict between the Zaire government and its critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One television producer, who doesn't want to be named, suggests that the killings of the Zaire students failed to capture media attention for a familiar reason -- the general negative image of the continent. If African despots kill their own citizens, the producer said, it isn't news, because the American attitude is, &quot;Well, what do you expect?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Imagine how an Associated Press account of Soviet conflicts might read if the dateline were Africa:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state of emergency was declared in eastern Uzbekistan Friday because of tribal warfare over the distribution of plots of land, and the president of the republic asked the Kremlin to help stem the wave of white-on-white violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the story is about the Soviets or the Irish or the Afghans, or about Greek and Turkish Cypriots or Hungarians and Rumanians, the word used is &quot;ethnic.&quot; Similar conflicts in Africa are -- almost invariably -- labeled &quot;tribal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his widely-quoted book The Africans, David Lamb, former Africa correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, calls tribalism &quot;perhaps the most potent force in day-to-day African life&quot; and says it is &quot;one of the most essential&quot; concepts to understand about Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many proponents of African affairs firmly reject the term &quot;tribe&quot; and would like to see the concept of ethnic divisions applied more cautiously.  While ethnic violence is &quot;commonplace&quot; in many parts of the world today, says the London-based magazine West Africa, ethnicity in Africa is treated differently -- and &quot;frequently dismissed as the atavistic barbarity of tribalism.&quot; The term tribe is &quot;an essentially derogatory and unhelpful label,&quot; the magazine says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scholars say that usage of the word &quot;tribe,&quot; in sociological and anthropological literature as well as in the popular press, is ambiguous and imprecise. &quot;Tribe&quot; can refer to groups with a range of social realities -- a common language, a common culture, shared ancestral lineages or a recognition of the same authority or ruler. But the word is ubiquitous. News accounts about Western Sahara call the heads of Saharan clans &quot;tribal&quot; chiefs, though the Saharans share a common language, religion and culture. Even the fighting in South Africa's Natal province is often called &quot;tribal,&quot; although all the participants and victims are Zulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seldom, the experts say, does the actual situation match the public conception of a coherent and separate group of people acting in concert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, says David Wiley, director of the African Studies Center at Michigan State University, the word &quot;tribe&quot; reinforces the images of African primitivism. Other peoples have ethnic or nationality-group loyalties; Africans have tribes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is no accident,&quot; Wiley says, &quot;that the contemporary uses of the term 'tribe' were developed during the nineteenth century rise of evolutionary and racist theories to designate alien non-white peoples as inferior or less civilized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, Africanists are promoting the view that the rifts commonly attributed to tribalism are as much an outgrowth of modern phenomena -- colonization, urbanization and economic hardship -- as they are a continuation of age-old traditional ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent letter to the New York Times, Christopher Love, a PhD candidate in African history at Yale, argued that the term &quot;tribe&quot; is &quot;more likely to reinforce stereotypes than provide insight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ethnic identity and conflict in African cities has much in common with urban ethnicity here or on other continents,&quot; Love wrote. &quot;Even rural ethnic conflicts are likely to have roots in social changes shaped by states and markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1978, during an outbreak of heavy fighting in Zaire's Shaba province, scholars took the U.S. media to task for assigning tribal motivation to a conflict whose causes lay elsewhere. Johannes Fabian, an anthropologist who had lived in Shaba for four years, complained to the New York Times about its characterization of the insurgency as tribal or secessionist. It was &quot;a popular rebellion&quot; against an unpopular government, Fabian said. Boston University political scientist Edouard Bustin noted in a column for the Christian Science Monitor that the Zaire rebels were so ethnically diverse that they had to use a mixture of French, Portuguese and Swahili to communicate among themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heavy use of the word &quot;tribe&quot; may stem in part from a view that African cultures have remained largely static -- frozen at some pre-twentieth century stage of development. Lamb writes of &quot;tribal regions that have existed for generations.&quot; West Africa counters that ethnicity &quot;is not an immutable phenomenon&quot; but a changing feature of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many countries, colonial authorities exploited and exacerbated ethnic differences for their own ends, says David Wiley, and the white regimes of southern Africa pursued an ag-gressive policy of &quot;re-tribalization.&quot; Some independent African governments have manipulated ethnic differences for similar reasons -- to make their divided populace easier to control. It is generally acknowledged that the ethnic animosities that surfaced during the 1990 rebellion against Samuel Doe in Liberia were a product of the Liberian socio-political climate of the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be incorrect, though, to suggest that ethnic hostilities are not a serious problem in much of the continent. &quot;Events throughout Africa have shown it is hypocritical and potentially dangerous to ignore the fact of ethnicity with its inherent divisiveness,&quot; Adebayo Adedeji, executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa, warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adedeji says that the &quot;uneven distribution of socio-economic advantage&quot; within countries has alienated and marginalized some ethnic groups, contributing to deepening tensions. With Africa's economic crisis worsening, these divisions threaten to grow deeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adedeji, along with several other outspoken African thinkers, sees the answer in democratization. He argues that a &quot;democratic experience in a plural society&quot; can provide the opportunities for full participation that will reduce ethnic rivalries and produce &quot;affiliation to the national bond&quot; among the numerous groups who find themselves within artificially-drawn national boundaries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the stories of the African travels of Dr. Doolittle -- where the monkeys are more intelligent than the people -- to the modern myths of commercial advertising, Americans are exposed to images of Africa that are almost entirely negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond shaping our impressions of a distant continent, says C. Payne Lucas, those images have domestic consequences. As director of Africare, an African-American-run development organization based in Washington, DC, Lucas tries to rouse public interest in African affairs. &quot;How can you expect young African-Americans to have any self respect,&quot; Lucas asks, &quot;when everything they hear about their ancestry and their heritage is negative?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black community leaders, dating back at least half a century to Marcus Garvey, have tried to organize effective protests against a view that equates Africa with primitivism. And in recent years, scholars in a number of disciplines have explored the roots of racial attitudes -- and the links between those attitudes and public policies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the studies have focused on the media, arguing that there is a persistent pattern that assumes African barbarity and that overlooks black sufferings or portrays them less vividly than those of whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beverly Hawk, who now teaches at Maine's Colby College, was at How-ard University when she analyzed U.S. newspaper reporting on Zimbabwe during the 1970s -- a time when coverage of the war in what was then Rhodesia was the main focus of American reporting on Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hawk found that in a war where 16-20 Africans died for every white person who was killed, only white deaths provoked empathetic descriptions.  Major newspapers like the Washington Post, New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Hawk says, routinely referred to the killings of whites as &quot;murders,&quot; &quot;massacres&quot; and &quot;slaughters.&quot; Evocative words such as &quot;atrocity,&quot; &quot;butchered&quot; and &quot;savage&quot; were used to describe attacks on whites, while accounts of black deaths were reported most often as anonymous numbers relayed by the Rhodesian government's information service. Of the major national newspapers, Hawk says, only the Christian Science Monitor chose not to carry emotional accounts of white deaths and funerals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An example of the reporting of the period was the heavy press coverage of the shooting down of a civilian government airliner by Zimbabwe guerrillas in 1978, in which 48 people died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please Don't Kill Us&quot; was the title Newsweek gave to a two-page spread that detailed the downing of the plane, the subsequent shooting of several passengers and the terror of the survivors. Accompanying the story was a photograph of guerrilla leaders Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe -- now Zimbabwe's president -- raising their glasses in a toast, as though celebrating the deaths. The photo was captioned &quot;We Shot It Down,&quot; with no acknowledgement that the picture pre-dated the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, four months earlier, a South African raid on a Namibian refugee camp in Angola got barely a mention in the U.S. media, although more than 600 people, mostly women and children, were killed and buried in mass graves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such unconscious value judgements are deeply rooted, Africanist scholars say, in a distorted historic view of Africa and Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From its earliest days as a republic, Americans saw Africa as a continent of wild beasts and savage people. The reading public was alternately fascinated and repelled by accounts like those of reporter Henry Morton Stanley. Sent by the New York Herald in 1866 to find the British missionary Dr. Livingstone, Stanley regaled audiences with front page accounts of his journeys. His later books about his African travels -- the most popular were Through the Dark Continent in 1879 and In Darkest Africa in 1890 -- shaped opinions in both Europe and North America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael McCarthy in his book Dark Continent: Africa As Seen by Americans, says the explorers' images of Africa were widely accepted by blacks as well as whites. &quot;During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially,&quot; McCarthy says, &quot;a majority of black Americans subscribed either consciously or unconsciously to the dangerous and fallacious idea of African inferiority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the observations of the popular writers were often ill-informed and misleading. African societies appeared to Europeans to be &quot;stateless.&quot; Africans seemed to have no religions. Even their fields looked uncultivated.  Scholars now know that many Afri-can cultures built powerful empires, that African theologies were complex and intricate, and that crop rows that looked jumbled or untended were often scientifically sound examples of productive intercropping or of shifting cultivation that let marginal tropical soils recover by lying fallow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Africa seen by explorers was used to explain and justify the subordination of people of African descent. &quot;The case against black people in America,&quot; says McCarthy, &quot;was advanced by showing that their African ancestors had failed to develop a fully civilized way of life. If Africans could not do it in their homeland, then how could their progeny possibly do any better in America?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inaugural issue of National Geographic magazine in 1889 featured an article by the geographic society's founder, Gardiner Hubbard, asserting that Africans had developed a degree of civilization only after coming into contact with Western culture. When that contact was cut, Hubbard wrote, Africans &quot;deteriorated into barbarism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The single most important source of reporting on Africa in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, says Michael McCarthy, was an African-American paper called the Freeman, published in Indiana. Articles by explorers and other African travelers were supplemented by cartoon caricatures depicting Africans with bones through their noses and necklaces of teeth. The comic savages spoke in crude dialects, often about their next human meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">School textbooks, travel writings and children's literature reinforced the media images.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it wasn't always that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fourteenth and fifteenth century Europe, pictorial art was the mass media of the era. A study of the period by the Menil Foundation's Image of the Black in Western Art project has unearthed and catalogued thousands of images from artworks and published several large volumes of its on-going research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the stunning reproductions, blacks appear as royalty, saints and sages as well as in more diverse roles as servants, pages and musicians.  Imperial Europe gave Africans a large place in its veneration of saints, its heraldry and its art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The institution of slavery changed all that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The large-scale contacts between Europeans and Africans coincided with the development of the slave trade in the sixteenth century. Explorers found that, despite its fabled wealth, Africa did not readily yield its riches to European entrepreneurs. &quot;From an economic point of view,&quot; says Volume 2 of the Menil study, &quot;Africa had only one thing to offer: manpower.&quot; The establishment of colonies in the Americas, built on labor-intensive crops like cotton, intensified the demand for chattel slavery -- and the need to justify it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White Over Black, Winthrop Jordan's classic 1968 study of racial attitudes, says that from the early 1700s in many parts of the Americas, &quot;one of the major daily concerns of responsible men was the effective control of masses of slaves.&quot; With slavery viewed as an economic necessity says McCarthy, &quot;theories about the origins of races were developed in order to classify Africans as subordinate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shift is clearly discernable in art. Within a period of a few years, says Volume 2 of the Menil books, new, more negative portrayals had &quot;eclipsed an image of the black that was the fruit of a centuries-old evolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian doctrine, which had taught that all people were part of the human family and equal before God, was transformed into the dogma of polygenesis, which held that races had been created as distinct and unequal.  Twelfth century enamels of apostles addressing a white man and a black man, symbolizing the variety and unity of humanity, were made obsolete by the evolving theory that Africans had been divinely fitted for servitude. (Jordan points to the anomaly that the &quot;curse of Ham,&quot; cited even today as a Biblical explanation of black inferiority, says &quot;absolutely nothing about skin color.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the abolitionist art of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries helped erase the diverse, often posi-tive, earlier perceptions of blacks, says art historian Hugh Honour in the latest of the Menil volumes. So potent were the images of blacks as victims, he says, &quot;that they reduced the possibilities of representing blacks in the former roles of saint or devil, proud Magus, regal personification of Africa, or even richly dressed and petted page boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legacy of that history persists in modern popular images of the continent. The 1981 movie &quot;First Family,&quot; starring Bob Newhart and Gilda Radner, featured an African ambassador who threw his diplomats out of airplanes to appease the gods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Citicorp ad of the previous year showed a white traveler in a safari suit surrounded by scantily-clad, spear-wielding Africans -- but still miraculously within the reach of the bank's financial services. &quot;Lose Citicorp Travelers Checks in Maputo,&quot; said the ad -- whose geography was as fuzzy as its ethnography -- &quot;and You're Not Up the Zambezi Without a Paddle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study by James Larson of the University of Washington found that, between 1972 and 1982, African stories -- although less likely to make the network television news shows than stories from elsewhere -- were 11% more likely to be about crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis orientation, says University of California historian Sylvester Whitaker, misses one of the most compelling African stories -- &quot;the sur-vivability of African communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you read that the GNP is disastrous,&quot; Whitaker says, &quot;that investment is in decline, that health problems are growing -- how are Africans making out at all? When you ask yourself that question and actu-ally begin to look for some experience to answer your question, it turns out that there's an awful lot of creativity that grows out of the dilemmas of African states.&quot; Those are stories, Whitaker says, that Americans never hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet major African crises can go unremarked, too. In 1973, Robert Maynard, now editor of the Oakland Tribune, chastised the U.S. news media for ignoring the genocidal civil war in Burundi that killed as many as 250,000 people, including half the country's primary school teachers. Stories that conveyed the horror of events in Burundi, Maynard argued, could have pressured the U. S., as the principle outside economic force in the country, to take action that would have saved lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the Ethiopian famine of 1984 that seared its images into public con-sciousness &quot;was all but ignored by the networks for two years after it had been documented,&quot; wrote Joanmarie Kalter in TV Guide, and it became a &quot;crisis of unprecedented proportions&quot; partly because it was ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But like the abolitionist's crusade that solidified an image of blacks as victims rather than actors, the fly-encrusted, stick-thin children of the anti-hunger campaign have had an unintended result. What is being called &quot;compassion fatigue&quot; has fused with a contemporary view of Africans as either brutal and corrupt or passive and exploited. The &quot;dark continent&quot; has come to be seen as the lost continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things could have been different, says Dominique de Menil, who launched the Image of the Black project in 1960. &quot;There was a time when the West adopted a black knight as its patron saint,&quot; she says, &quot;a time when artists did not neglect to include an African among the resurrected, a time when a white King Solomon embraced a black Queen of Sheba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the &quot;dream of an authentic cooperation between Europe and Africa, of a sharing of ideals and knowledge,&quot; she says, &quot;was shattered by crimes so atrocious that they left no images.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the aftermath of the catastrophic Ethiopian famine that killed more than 300,000 people, TV Guide reviewed network television news coverage that ran from October 1984 through September 1985. The magazine's May 24, 1986 issue reported the results in an article called &quot;The Untold Stories of Africa: Why TV Is Missing Some Big Ones.&quot; Author Joanmarie Kalter also interviewed reporters and producers responsible for the network reporting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;story that's left untold&quot; after all the hours of programming, ABC's Karen Burnes told Kalter, is the one that explains the roots of Africa's economic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalter delved into pre-colonial history to tell TV Guide readers that Africa was once &quot;a self-sustaining continent of market gardeners&quot; who cushioned themselves during bad times with &quot;such village customs as the sharing of food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the colonial governments of Europe, Kalter wrote, &quot;reorganized agriculture, narrowing the range of products to stress one or two export 'cash crops' for the world market. And the independent African governments that succeeded them dangerously enlarged on that policy.&quot; Sudan produces cotton, Ethiopia grows tea, Uganda provides coffee and Ghana lives off cocoa production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalter said journalists reporting on African hunger should let their audiences know that a big reason why African countries can't feed themselves is that they're feeding and clothing us. Peasants, pushed onto the poorest land to make room for export crops, have trouble eaking out a subsistence, and in times of war or drought, they're nudged from poverty into starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, almost every African country is caught in a relentless cycle.  Debts were accumulated to pay for expanding crop production, for prestige construction or for development projects that were often poorly-conceived -- and, all too often, for the conspicuous consumption of an elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notes were to be paid off with revenues from export crops. But when commodity prices collapsed more than a decade ago, increased borrowing was needed just to buy food. &quot;Sudan,&quot; Kalter wrote, &quot;not long ago considered the potential breadbasket of its region, is now so in debt that some 80% of its export earn-ings go merely to pay off interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And unless debts are reduced or forgiven, there appears to be no way to break the cycle. Foreign debts have to be paid in hard foreign currency. And about the only way African countries can earn hard currency is to produce more export crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalter cites with dismay television reports like one that blamed Ethiopia's famine on &quot;people whose ancient and unproductive farming methods are destroying the land they depend on for food.&quot; None of the famine coverage, Kalter said, mentioned debt or the dependence on exports. She also critiqued television's focus on Western relief efforts which she argued, &quot;mirrored the colonial conception of Africans as backward and helpless, a 'white man's burden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of 117 quotes from analysts and professionals on network famine reports, only 18, Kalter said, were from Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a number of ways, Kalter concluded, television coverage had &quot;obscured the real connections between the well-fed viewers in the West and the malnourished people of Africa.&quot; While the networks are not watching, she says, &quot;Africa increasingly affects both our pocketbooks and our lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News organizations are not doing their jobs, Kalter said, when they fail to inform the American public that &quot;while our development aid increased by 17% in four years, our military aid rose by some 135%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does that inflame the conflicts that trigger famine,&quot; Kalter asked, &quot;or help resolve them?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since early 1988, American television viewers have been able to see a concentrated treatment of news from one part of Africa. Eighty stations in the U.S. carry &quot;South Africa Now,&quot; a 30-minute program produced by Globalvision, an independent New York-based production company, in conjunction with the Africa Fund, an educational organization associated with the American Committee on Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show, which is also on the air in several African and Caribbean nations, provides weekly updates on developments in southern Africa. An investigative team reports stories that are overlooked by other broadcast outlets, such as the export to South Africa of toxic waste by an American company. Segments on cultural news appear weekly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Globalvision's Danny Schechter believes that the show has made an important contribution to public understanding of apartheid. &quot;We have been taking this issue into America's living rooms and into living rooms all over the world every week for two years,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding has been a perennial problem, although major grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the United Nations have enabled the show to expand in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're doing all this in the sub-basement of television pricing,&quot; says Schechter, who spent eight years as a producer at ABC's &quot;20/20&quot;. The staff work for salaries that are well below industry standard, and they rely on volunteer help to get each show produced. &quot;Our annual expenditures roughly equal the weekly budget of '60 Minutes' or '20/20,'&quot; he says. &quot;The frustration is that we could do so much more with a decent level of funding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schechter says some financial supporters are pulling out because they think the show's original purpose -- breaking through South Africa's censorship -- is no longer required, since President F. W. de Klerk's reform program was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show is not without its critics. Some public television stations have refused to carry it, regarding the reporting as partisan. Others have relegated the program to low-audience time slots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But television critics have given it good reviews and the show has been cited for &quot;excellence in television&quot; by Channels, a magazine on the television industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The audience has been particularly enthusiastic, suggesting that the show is striking a chord with a segment of the market that has felt its interests were poorly served by the broadcast media. &quot;We have had tremendous response from our viewers,&quot; Schechter says. &quot;We receive a huge volume of letters, and the contributions they send have helped us stay on the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 21, 1990, scores of world leaders gathered in a soccer stadium for a dramatic midnight ceremony. After a long war against South African rule, the last colony in sub-Saharan Africa became an independent nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independence of Namibia was the end of an era that began when the European powers divided Africa among themselves at the Berlin Conference of 1884-'85. It was also, many hoped, a sign of things to come in Africa. The constitution that came into effect that night is one of the world's most democratic. Among its features is an environmental bill of rights, designed to reverse a century of ecological decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coverage of the historic event on the ABC &quot;World News Tonight&quot; was a concise tag at the end of another item:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, at midnight, the flag of South Africa was replaced by a flag of Namibia, marking the independence of the last South African colony. A black government took over power of the country which has a seven percent white minority.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC also devoted two sentences to the item; CBS doubled the coverage with four sentences. Only CNN reported the independence of Namibia as more than a backdrop for talks between U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who attended the ceremonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the cost of transporting reporters and camera crews long distances is cited by network executives as a major reason for infrequent African coverage, Namibia was a reminder that the most important reasons may lie elsewhere. All four commercial networks had crews on the spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we might have done better on Namibia,&quot; says Bill Wheatley, who for five years was executive producer of the NBC &quot;Nightly News.&quot; &quot;That certainly is an important place with ramifications for Americans, given the American involvement over the years, and also because of the South African connection. So I think that deserved more time than it got.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Gergen, communications director in the Reagan White House and now editor-at-large for U.S. News and World Report, says the Namibia reporting was part of a pattern. &quot;The history of American media,&quot; he says, &quot;has been one of general inattention to Africa, except when there's been major famine or conflict.&quot; Gergen says &quot;parachute journalism&quot; -- a quick in-and-out during crisis situations -- has been the most common response to African events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even African crises tend to be undercovered. Before Nelson Mandela's release from prison attracted attention to the fighting in South Africa's Natal province, the killings there went largely unreported in the U.S. press. Yet since 1987, according to several estimates, more people have died in Natal than have been killed in Lebanon and Northern Ireland combined. The fact that the major African story is economic -- always a difficult topic for mass media to tackle -- further hampers coverage of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But economic stories in some parts of the world do attract attention.  &quot;We are now getting a lot of coverage of the problems of economic restructuring in Eastern Europe and the social costs of austerity programs,&quot; says Pauline Baker, a former Democratic Senate aide now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People don't have a clue of what's been going on in Africa since the eighties in terms of social costs of economic restructuring. I don't think there's been either sufficient explanation of why the continent is so distressed or sufficient coverage of the exceptions to the rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baker points out that the debt burden -- which is proportionately heavier for Africa's economies than for countries anywhere else in the world -- is covered as though it were almost exclusively a Latin American problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa &quot;has to be undercovered,&quot; says John Leonard, media critic for CBS's &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; &quot;because I read all the time -- I read hundreds of magazines, I get five newspapers a day -- and I don't know what's going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington Post columinist Jim Hoagland, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of South Africa, says Africa has gotten short shrift in the media for a long time. &quot;I was foreign editor and assistant managing editor &cent;at the Post/ for about eight years,&quot; Hoagland says. &quot;And I would have to be honest in saying that Africa weighed relatively lightly on the scales of newsworthiness.  As a former correspondent in Africa, I regret that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Times Managing Editor Joseph Lelyveld also won a Pulitzer for South Africa reporting. Like Hoagland, Lelyveld sometimes has questioned the way news decisions are made. He recalls his stint in Zaire -- then the Congo -- as a young reporter. The world's media, he says, congregated in the capital, practicing journalism-by-press-release. His stories made the front page regularly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a time when a place is recognized as being hot,&quot; he says, &quot;almost any reasonable development can be front page news or make the network news simply because there's a concentration of journalists there. That creates a media momentum, unrelated to what's really important. Sometimes very fundamental and important coverage gets lost at moments like that as the herd tramples around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lelyveld says he began to feel &quot;a little fraudulent that I was writing authoritatively about a subject I knew very little about. I knew the capital -- and this was a vast country. The rest I was doing mostly on hearsay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, &quot;almost with a sinking feeling,&quot; he left the pack, venturing into the countryside and filing stories quite unlike those of other reporters.  Although his dispatches ran in the paper, they were buried deep on the inside pages. And when the New York Times downplayed the story, other papers followed suit. Years later, Lelyveld said he still felt a bit guilty that &quot;in a sense, I had taken the Congo off the front page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Codi Simon, the foreign editor at National Public Radio, acknowledges that what's being reported in other media influences coverage at NPR. &quot;It's a combination of factors,&quot; she says, &quot;like what's in the papers, what's on the wires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the past year,&quot; Simon says, &quot;Africa hasn't been a priority of ours -- not because we're not interested and not because we don't care -- but because so much else is happening in the world. It's very hard to find the air time right now to fit in an important but frankly secondary story from anywhere else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even journalists who say that Africa is a priority are affected by the pressure to concentrate on other areas. John Barth produces the public radio show &quot;Marketplace,&quot; a daily program designed to acquaint U.S. listeners with global economic issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot possibly go for a week without doing something about the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,&quot; he says. &quot;There's too much going on there that is immediately important to our government and the businesses that are cutting deals there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's real problem, Jim Hoagland says, is that it &quot;is becoming increasingly irrelevant economically to the rest of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Wilkins, who teaches at George Mason University and has served on the editorial boards of both the Washington Post and the New York Times, disagrees. &quot;I think Africa is undercovered,&quot; he says, &quot;and I don't believe that decisions are made on the basis of its economic importance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like others who have questioned editors and producers about the lack of Africa coverage, Wilkins has heard, time and again, that there is no constituency for news about Africa in the United States. &quot;Let me tell you something,&quot; he says. &quot;A very substantial proportion of the people in the United States are of African descent. And it's only the ignorance and the racism of people who make news decisions that keep those stories -- real stories, powerful stories, interesting stories -- from reaching our television screens and our newspapers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilkin's assessment gets strong reactions from media decision-makers.  &quot;That is something which I categorically reject,&quot; says NPR's Codi Simon. &quot;I do not think it's a question of racism. That's something I completely disagree with. It is not because these are black people who are starving. There are starving people everywhere who are not covered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you don't think racial factors play a role, Wilkins counters, look at who's making the choices. &quot;What is news and what is newsworthy,&quot; he says, &quot;is basically decided by middle class, middle age, white American males -- people who have a very narrow slice of human experience but who overvalue the ability of their limited experience to give them a broad world view. Most of these are people who have never had a close African-American friend, let alone an African acquaintance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finding out whether Wilkins is right about what sort of people are making news decisions is no easy task. News organizations whose daily business is asking probing questions of others are remarkably reluctant to give straight answers about their own institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katherine McQuay, media relations manager for the &quot;NBC Nightly News,&quot; says that asking about the ethnic composition of the show's editors and producers is an &quot;unfair&quot; question. Neither ABC, the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Christian Science Monitor nor the Wall Street Journal would provide any information about the racial make-up of their editorial staffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Round-about inquiries, though, suggest that there is not a single African-American making decisions about foreign news at the television networks or at any major national newspaper. There is more diversity, though, at some of the strong regional papers such as the Detroit Free Press, where a black foreign editor reports to a black managing editor for news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Kovach, curator of Harvard's Neiman Foundation, agrees that the background of news decision-makers helps define what is news and what isn't.  &quot;All major news organizations are run&quot; he says, by people who are &quot;white, generally Anglo-Saxon, predominantly male. And they see the world through that prism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kovach, who was Washington bureau chief for the New York Times and for two years edited the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, uses himself as an example. &quot;I'm Albanian-American,&quot; he says, &quot;and things that happen in the Balkins are inherently important to me. No matter how good an editor I am, I'm not going to follow African news in the same way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African stories will continue to disappear, Kovach says, &quot;until newsrooms have more blacks who consider their African heritage important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, apparently, a long way to go before that happens. Joseph Foote of Southern Illinois University conducts an annual &quot;visibility&quot; survey that identifies the network television correspondents who are seen most often on the evening newscasts of ABC, CBS and NBC. His latest survey received press attention for its finding that only six women are among the 50 most visible reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Foote found no black reporters among the 50 most visible correspondents and only two in the top 100, ranked 59 and 69. No black women made the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the print newsroom level, though, there have been significant, if limited, changes in the last decade. What Newsday deputy editor Les Payne used to call &quot;the unwritten rule&quot; against assigning black reporters to cover Africa has been relaxed. Payne was among the journalists who complained that the same editors who would think it absurd to refuse to send a Jewish reporter to the Middle East would routinely bar black reporters from Africa, on grounds of potential bias. Now, the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Baltimore Sun and the Detroit Free Press have all assigned black reporters to the Africa beat -- and the exper-iment has been judged a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Hoagland says that the Washington Post's Nairobi-based reporter, Neil Henry, has great storytelling abilities, and he &quot;simply wrote a lot of stories into the paper that wouldn't have gotten there solely on the typical, and somewhat stereotypical, 'newsworthy' valuations that we place in drawing up the front page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, says &quot;Marketplace&quot;'s Barth, the lack of Africa interest by editors and producers sets up a hard-to-escape cycle. &quot;Let's say you're a trained journalist,&quot; he posits. &quot;And you want to make a name for yourself, especially as a freelancer. Well, you're not going to go to Africa if the editors of major publications aren't interested in running Africa stories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to break the cycle at the editorial level, even with the best of intentions, concedes Roger Wilkins. At the New York Times, he says, no major editing job has ever gone to a black. &quot;Now that's the premier news organization in the United States,&quot; Wilkins says, &quot;and it's run by people who would like to do better, I think, but the legacy of the past lives on.&quot; Too often, Wilkins says, black talent wasn't nurtured and black reporters weren't promoted. Many of the best left journalism for other fields. &quot;So people who are in charge now,&quot; he says, &quot;who would very much like to promote blacks into news decision-making jobs, can't do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In informal survey of reporters interested in Africa, both black and white, reveals a deep frustration that seems to go beyond the normal dissatisfaction most journalists feel about not getting enough print or air time for their stories. But individual reporters feel too vulnerable to make their critiques openly. Editors are defensive, they say, and respond poorly to charges of bad news judgement, especially if there is a suggestion of racial bias in the decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over and over, though, reporters tell stories of major African developments being ignored by the media gate-keepers. Several journalists have tried to interest their editors in the democracy movement that has swept a number of African countries, forcing governments to allow opposition parties, agree to free elections and curtail their own powers -- with little of the media scrutiny that has attended similar movements in Europe. &quot;One editor told me that nobody cared if African countries got democracy,&quot; says a reporter for a prominent paper. A broadcast reporter who lobbied for more Africa coverage was told to stick to &quot;mainstream stories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a circle that exists here,&quot; says David Gergen, &quot;and it's not necessarily a virtuous circle. American foreign policy tends to reflect the geopolitical interests of the country.&quot; And Africa, Gergen says, has not been seen as geopolitically important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of news coverage say that geopolitical concerns, by themselves, don't guarantee coverage in Africa. Covert U.S. aid to the Unita rebel movement in Angola has been a contentious foreign policy issue for years -- and has been hotly-debated in Congress on several occasions -- but has not been pursued by journalists, says University of North Carolina historian David Newbury. Even though the removal of Cuban troops from Angola was a foreign policy goal of four U.S. administrations, the issue has remained largely invisible in the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some editors and producers are openly critical of their profession's inattention to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Turner, executive vice president at Cable News Network (CNN), is impatient with the television executives who say they are covering Africa adequately. &quot;I'm here to tell you that we are not doing a good job,&quot; says Turner emphatically, &quot;but at least we know it! So much more needs to be done, and we'll do more, and even that won't be enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABC's Ted Koppel also thinks Africa is poorly covered. The &quot;Nightline&quot; host believes there is &quot;still a certain fundamental racism in this country&quot; which explains why half a million Ethiopians dying doesn't provoke the same response as would the deaths of half a million Italians. Added to the racism, Koppel says, is the difficulty of interesting the American public in international news stories in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for &quot;Nightline,&quot; he says, the prime obstacle to increased Africa reporting is the logistical requirements of television. The show needs film, he says, to launch each topic. &quot;We have roughly 35 people who work on 'Nightline,' Koppel says, &quot;and we have five programs a week. On average, that means you've got seven people per program.&quot; Taking a correspondent and crew out of the mix for two or three weeks to do an Africa piece can be done -- as when &quot;Nightline&quot; entered Liberia with rebels fighting the government of Samuel Doe -- but it's too difficult and expensive to be done frequently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Turner, too, cites logistical problems, including the shortage of satellite uplink equipment in Africa. &quot;But that's an explanation,&quot; he says, &quot;not an excuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There comes a time,&quot; Turner says, &quot;when you say, 'Dammit, we have to do these stories on Africa. These are important things that people need to know about.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN's immediate solution to better international coverage is a program that airs stories contributed by television agencies, many of them government-controlled, from countries around the world. It's a kind of global soapbox, Turner says, that gives U.S. audiences a different prism on the world. For the longer term, Turner is hopeful that the development of portable mini-broadcast stations will take advanced transmission technology into the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he expects to encounter opposition from African authorities who would like to remain in charge of what is sent out from their countries, Turner says such attitudes are not unique to Africa. &quot;We have the same problems in countries as 'civilized' -- that's in quotes,&quot; he says -- &quot;as the United Kingdom and across Europe. Africa is not alone in its desire -- desire by the governments -- to want to control what goes out of there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NPR's Codi Simon thinks the problem of access to official sources is severe enough in Africa to kill stories that would otherwise be aired. &quot;What do you do as an American journalistic institution,&quot; she asks, &quot;when you have got to have the other side, and the other side won't give it to you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria Brittain, assistant foreign editor at the Guardian newspaper in London, hears similar complaints often, but she thinks they're unfair. The principle obstacle to access, she says, is the economic crisis in African countries. &quot;The infrastructures of all these countries are very frequently on the verge of collapse,&quot; she says, &quot;which means that their level of information is extremely poor, their &cent;government/ ministers are all too busy to brief journalists, it's extremely difficult to get around in their countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the physical, economic and social crisis in Africa that makes it difficult to cover,&quot; she says &quot;It's not, in my view, something to do with Africans being particularly unwilling to cooperate with journalists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the worst problem for reporters covering Africa is not indigenous to the continent, says Brittain, who has reported for the Times of London, the New Statesman and the BBC. &quot;Dealing with all the Third World's issues is extremely difficult,&quot; she says. &quot;But it's mainly difficult because you have to bludgeon your editors to give you space to cover these issues.&quot; As an editor now herself, she tries to be sensitive to the Africa stories that may not be getting the exposure they merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the most frequently cited reasons for the dearth of Africa reporting is a low level of public interest. Some editors say that even if Roger Wilkins is right that the black community is as important a constituency for Africa as, for example, the Polish community is for news of Eastern Europe, the pressure for greater coverage isn't felt in the nation's newsrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's important, Bill Kovach says, because commercial considerations are increasingly important components of news decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As print and broadcast media have been bought by larger corporations, many editors and producers have felt a growing pressure to cut costs. In 1989, the &quot;Today&quot; show planned a week-long series of live broadcasts from Africa with host Bryant Gumbel. It would have meant the largest exposure Africa had ever had on commercial television. Five reporter/producers were assigned to develop story ideas. But before filming could begin, the project was suspended.  Executives at General Electric, which owns NBC, had balked at spending the money for Africa, according to network sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for print media, Kovach says, newspapers are giving more attention to &quot;issues that concern the consuming public, which inordinately is white, middle class-upper class, suburban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editors are under pressure, Kovach says, to increase circulation among that kind of constituency. &quot;I've worked for news organizations,&quot; he says, &quot;where we've done African stories that gained a wide following among the black readers of the community. But the advertising department and the business side of the newspaper were not interested in those stories because the advertisers weren't interested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Kwitny, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and public television producer, says that the quest to attract new readers with &quot;soft news&quot; -- such as stories about celebrities -- means something else has to be eliminated. &quot;And Africa,&quot; he says, &quot;would be near the top of most editors' lists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News executives agree that if a broader interest in Africa were demonstrated, all the obstacles to better African reporting would be overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think there's any doubt,&quot; says NBC's Bill Wheatley, &quot;that if editors and producers feel there's substantial public interest that they'll find a way to do coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post's Jim Hoagland understands why some critics charge that the lack of Africa coverage is itself partly responsible for a lack of public interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a great deal of validity to that,&quot; he says. &quot;We become -- as readers and therefore as editors also -- familiar with characters, with specific people, we become interested in their fate. If you don't have information about those people on a fairly steady basis, you don't know who they are. We've just faced this in Eastern Europe, where we've had to introduce an entire new cast of characters to the readers, and now they know who Vaclav Havel is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether that knowledge translates into interest is a topic of debate.  Many editors and producers assume a widespread fascination with the Czech playwright-president. But surveys by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press -- established by the company that owns the Los Angeles Times -- suggests that the level of public interest in Eastern Europe has been exaggerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The survey results themselves are surprising to us,&quot; says Center director Donald Kellerman. Despite extensive media coverage, only 6% of those polled by the Center said they closely followed the Havel visit to the U.S. and only 14% could identify him. By contrast, 77% of the public could identify Nelson Mandela and his release led public interest ratings for an extended period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although the American public watched closely the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kellerman says, &quot;a few days later, a few weeks later, they told us repeatedly in one way and another that they are confused by the events, the cast of characters change, they do not have a sense that this is something with which they can empathize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if the Times Mirror surveys are right, the same factors that cloud public understand of Africa apply also to areas of the world that get far more sustained press attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Gergen thinks what Africa needs is an organized constituency to press its case. The Middle East, he says, gets coverage that is &quot;disproportionate to the number of people who live there and, if you're a sub-Saharan African, I think you'd probably argue it's disproportionate to the importance of the Middle East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to develop a stronger citizen interest in Africa,&quot; says Roger Wilkins. &quot;African interest organizations have to become more acutely aware of these issues and begin to act as intelligent and critical consumers of the news product. News executives respond to pressure just like other executives, and they are not getting the pressures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential power of an Africa lobby has been demonstrated in the case of South Africa. Organizations like TransAfrica, with its daily demonstrations outside the South African embassy in Washington, forced media attention to the issue. And in the wake of the publicity, Congress passed economic sanctions against South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlayne Hunter-Gault of the &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour&quot; says there is no shortage of African stories that can interest and move Americans. &quot;It's the human side of the story,&quot; she says, &quot;that tends to tap into the interest of people. Every story that I have ever done, every issue that I have ever approached -- when I have done it in terms of how people are affected, the reaction has been incredible. I think that's what's missing in a lot of the Africa coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the people impressed by the depth of Hunter-Gault's reporting is South African newspaper editor Zwelakhe Sisulu, who has been serving as a press spokesman for Nelson Mandela. Both Hunter-Gault and &quot;Nightline&quot;'s Ted Koppel were well-prepared and sensitive to the pressures Mandela faced in his first days out of prison, Sisulu says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was disappointed, he says, with most of the U.S. reporters, especially television people, who flooded into South Africa after the release, and he came to see their attitudes as symptomatic of an American approach that leads to superficial understanding and poor reporting. &quot;They tended on the whole to be very arrogant,&quot; Sisulu says. &quot;They expected people to lie down and let themselves be trampled over&quot; because of the importance of the networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the American crews, he says, hired &quot;bouncers&quot; to clear the way for them in crowds. And sometimes the hired muscle came into conflict with the security arranged for Mandela. &quot;The sheer competitiveness of it all was quite terrifying,&quot; Sisulu says. &quot;I'd always thought of TV people as journalists. I've now changed my mind; I think they are a breed of their own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sort of thing has to change, says Ed Turner, and educating Americans to the fact that they live in an interdependent world is one place to start. &quot;Why is it smart to invest in schooling?&quot; he asks. &quot;Why is it clever to understand your neighbor?&quot; Because if we don't know more about the nations of Africa, he answers, &quot;we are absolutely guaranteeing ourselves more and more difficulties and troubles ahead. Without the understanding of each other, you're bound to be in conflict with each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Gergen, who has co-chaired a recent study on Africa and the media for the Rockefeller Foundation, agrees that out of both morality and self-interest, Americans should be giving Africa more attention. But he's not sure how or when that will happen. &quot;I think, to be realistic,&quot; he says, &quot;we ought to see that there are some big mountains to cross to get from here to where we ought to be, and I think those mountains are going to be higher in the next couple of years, not lower.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some journalists find signs of hope. Jon Kwitny says that while the easing of tensions in Europe may be focusing attention away from Africa, it may also make Africa coverage less distorted. Despite the tragedy of the Liberian conflict, he says, it was refreshing to &quot;finally read about an African conflict without one side being identified as 'communists' and the other as 'freedom fighters.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that Cold War perspective is gone, Kwitny says, &quot;that's one thing to be thankful for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Leonard of &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; says that what gets in the papers and on television &quot;are those things that the people who run news organizations or work for news organizations care about. Individual energies, biases, passions -- that's how things change.&quot; So a few people in the right places who care about Africa, Leonard believes, can begin to change the journalistic agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a real chicken-and-egg situation,&quot; says Charlayne Hunter-Gault.  &quot;People look at it and say, 'There's no interest in Africa.' Well, there's no coverage of Africa. If there was coverage of Africa, there would be interest in Africa. It's as simple as that, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1556 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa News Service is a non-profit news agency. We are professionals, adhering as closely as possible to that central premise of American journalism that news should be reported accurately and objectively without regard to the personal opinions of the reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, we are not naive enough to believe that information is ever neutral. The existence of organizations like Accuracy in Media and FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), which hurl darts at press coverage from opposing viewpoints, testifies to the fact that one person's objectivity is another's bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the very existence of Africa News is an implicit assertion that values and opinions intrude upon news judgements. If we thought Africa was getting an appropriate share of media attention that was objective and informed, we wouldn't have spent close to two decades in the struggle to keep Africa News Service afloat financially.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, because the continent we cover is not regarded as particularly newsworthy by media decision-makers, we are vulnerable to charges that our reports represent &quot;special interests&quot; rather than impartial news judgements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our hard-won reputation for accuracy and professionalism was carved out year by year, bit by bit, against the odds, and it's the most valuable asset we have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A foundation official recently told us that the only criticism she'd encountered about Africa News is that we occasionally stray across the line that divides reporting on Africa from advocacy for Africa. That perception, we told her, is an occupational hazard we will always face. All we can do to counter it is to wait it out, confident that time will vindicate our work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we did a front-page series for the Washington Post on the war in Western Sahara in 1977, there were charges that the articles were pro-Polisario, since the conventional wisdom of the time was that the independence group was a sham and would soon disappear into oblivion. If we said otherwise, the reasoning went, we must be partisan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the war has brought Morocco's economy to the verge of collapse, and the United Nations, flush from its Namibian success, is sponsoring a peace process. Our reports that Polisario was an indigenous movement with a capacity to fight indefinitely have proved to be nothing more than good, solid journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be difficult to recall now that only a short time ago, the African National Congress (ANC) was almost never mentioned in reporting from South Africa. To say that the group would be a major force in South Africa's future invited being labeled not just &quot;advocates&quot; but left-wing extremists. So when we wrote about the growing campaign for Nelson Mandela's release and the ground swell of popular support for the ANC, as we did in 1980, we took care to qualify anything we couldn't prove. When we quoted newspaper editor Percy Qoboza saying Mandela would win any free South African election, we acknowledged that his claim was &quot;difficult to assess in an atmosphere where support of the ANC is a crime of treason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The balancing act between forthrightness and credibility is easier now. Our reputation is secure, and anyone who doubts our credentials can look at the record of our 17 years of print and broadcast reporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But people who knew Africa have always known they could turn to us for the straight story that nobody else had -- both the breaking news and the background to make sense of it. We produced dramatic radio reports from the front lines when Ugandan exiles and Tanzanian troops overthrew Idi Amin. We chronicled the crumbling of imperial Ethiopia and the brutality of the regime that replaced it. We interviewed American mercenaries in Zaire on their way to a CIA-backed takeover attempt in Angola. We brought to light the internal Africa policy deliberations of five successive U.S. administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such reporting is not just lively and interesting. It is essential information for a democratic society. If the public can be kept ignor-ant or misled by policy-makers who themselves are poorly informed or self-deluding, we're all in trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February of 1981, ten months after Samuel Doe took power, we began an article on Liberia by saying that &quot;the real direction of Liberia's military government remains uncertain and observers are wondering whether the admin-istration's early populist tendencies have been abandoned.&quot; Already, the new government was squandering a popular mandate to reform and democratize the country, and the seeds of 1990 were planted.  The revolt against Doe was no surprise; the surprise was that it was so long in coming.  The tragedy is that change had to come the way it did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other &quot;Liberia's&quot; in the making. And other African issues that demand sober realism. Neither the people of Africa nor the taxpayers of America are served by the pretense that African countries can pay off their mounting foreign debts without a restructuring of the economic ground rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marianne Spiegel, a former Senate aide and State Department policy planner, once wrote an endorsement of Africa News that we have quoted often because it articulates a goal towards which we constantly strive in our reporting:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa News profoundly influences policy -- not by advocating positions or slanting its stories, but by intelligent, informed, reliable reporting. I don't know what we would do without it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We haven't begun, though, to do the reporting job that's needed. Yes, we occasionally write for the major newspapers and produce reports for National Public Radio (NPR). From time to time we produce syndicated programs for commercial radio. The biweekly publication Africa News reaches an influential readership. In the last year, barely a day has passed that we haven't briefed a reporter heading for Africa, faxed information from our library files to a network news show, helped interviewers formulate questions to ask African guests, or provided our materials to Africa-interest groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we've done it with the help of some of the best in the business.  We proudly claim to have spotted journalistic talents that have become recognized in their field: NPR's Celeste Wesson and Mike Schuster, the Wall Street Journal's Joe Davidson, the New York Times's Howard French and National Geographic's Charlie Cobb all once reported for Africa News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we can't expect to keep such talents very often. Anyone qualified to do the work that is demanded at Africa News could work anywhere. So the people here know that they are bypassing chances for fame and fortune elsewhere for a job where their next paycheck is uncertain. And they can anticipate working through the night to meet the next deadline, knowing that the pressure won't ease after the deadline is met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who has tried to run a small business can imagine what it is like to have to find the time, constantly, to train new business and circulation managers because the last ones needed more financial security and less strain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What all that means is missed opportunities on a daily basis. It means not finding the time to report on Liberia for &quot;All Things Considered&quot; until the fifth month of the fighting (it was NPR's first report on the topic); it means not being able to pursue a film on Zimbabwe, ten years after independence, for PBS distribution; it means not accepting offers to write articles for major magazines; it means delaying radio syndications because we don't have the time to produce the demo tapes that will be used to market the series to stations; and it means not being able to raise the money for the investment in increased circulation that will make Africa News a self-sustaining publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regular readers know that this editorial note is a departure from our practice of reporting the news and letting it speak for itself -- and saving stories about the importance of our work for fundraising efforts. There are two reasons for the shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, this issue is uniquely editorial in its premise and content. We thought it deserved an explanation. Second, we're making a pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we prepared this special report, and the half-hour radio documentary that accompanies it -- interviewing dozens of the top reporters, editors and producers in the print and broadcast industries -- one thing became clear. The reasons for the poor coverage of Africa in the major media are deeply ingrained in historical perceptions and present practices, and they won't change quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the best chance for improving that coverage -- as well as for maintaining an independent source of African news -- is Africa News Service. We have the access; we have the expertise; we have the necessary determination. But we don't have the resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we admit it, we're advocates -- not of biased reporting and not of concealing uncomfortable truths, but of the belief that the opportunity to pursue life, liberty and happiness is as fundamental a right for African people as it is for the people of Poland or Rumania or Nicaragua -- or ourselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the next three years we will be trying to build an Africa News Service that can effectively tell the tales of that pursuit. And we'll need help -- a great deal of help -- from every person who cares about Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get ready.--Tami Hultman, Executive Editor</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the end of this month, the government of Kenya plans to begin marketing the AIDS drug Kemron, first tested at the Kenya Medical Re-search Institute (Kemri) last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of two companies that helped Kemri initiate testing of Kemron -- Amarillo Cell Culture (ACC) of Amarillo, Texas and Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories of Okayama, Japan -- will travel to Nairobi to attend Kemron's launching ceremonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kemron saga began in 1989, when ACC founder Dr. Joseph Cummins ran initial tests in Texas using a single sub-species of the protein alpha interferon, administered to AIDS patients in low doses. After test results looked promising, Cummins presented data to Kemri Director Dr. Davy Koech.  Koech immediately offered to help expand Cummins' research, simply because &quot;nothing in the world was known to be working&quot; to alleviate AIDS, according to Dr. Arthur Obel, Koech's colleague at Kemri.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cummins, who has been experimenting with low-dosage alpha inteferon for much of his career, jumped at the offer. &quot;We've been trying for twelve years to get people to pay attention to us,&quot; Cummins says. &quot;I applaud the courage of the &cent;Kenyans/ to try this new tech-nology when no one else would.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koech suggested using an alpha interferon formula produced by Hayashibara that contained fourteen, rather than one, sub-species of the protein. Using the Hayashibara alpha interferon, Koech and Obel set up initial tests at Kemri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To minimize the impact of psychological factors, most studies of new drugs include a control group that receives a placebo, an inert substance that does not contain the drug being tested. But the first tests at Kemri did not include a placebo control group because there was so little data on the drug.  &quot;We were starting from scratch,&quot; Obel says. &quot;We had no way of comparing Kemron against anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the results were astonishing, the researchers say. After days of treatment, symptoms such as lack of appetite, swollen lymph nodes, skin disorders, diarrhea, fever and fatigue were significantly reduced. After four weeks on the drug, patients' white blood cells -- the body's disease-fighting army -- had increased by hundreds. And in the most startling finding, Koech reported that 10% of his patients had &quot;sero-converted,&quot; testing negative for the HIV antibody after treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Results of follow-up testing under World Health Organization supervision in Kenya, Cameroon, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire and Zimbabwe, available in early July appeared to confirm that Kemron can reduce AIDS-related symptoms without discernible side effects. However, no patients in the new tests sero-converted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial reports on the Kenyan experiments in February were met with skepticism or ignored by many scientists, who found it hard to believe that small doses of alpha interferon taken orally could produce results when large doses by injection did not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testing outside Africa has been delayed because of the difficulty in finding appropriate subjects. Patients often have a history of using other drugs that affect test results. &quot;The good thing about the African study is that to our knowledge no patient over there had access to AZT,&quot; says Dr. Alan Richards, director of research at ACC in Amarillo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richards says studies will probably begin &quot;in the near future&quot; in Britain, the Philippines and Thailand. &quot;We're waiting for a signature here, some papers there,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, ACC has licensed Interferon Sciences (IS) of New Brunswick, New Jersey to test alpha interferon in collaboration with Dr. Joseph Hassett at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, according to Dr. Stanley Schutzbank, IS executive vice-president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because Kemron is now presumed to have positive effects on AIDS patients, testing it has become more complicated. &quot;By the time most patients reach our hands they are in very advanced stages of the disease,&quot; Obel says.  &quot;Putting those patients on a placebo is in effect advancing them towards death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Mount Sinai tests involve giving placebos to a control group, Hassett is accepting only patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC), rather than patients with AIDS in advanced stages, because &quot;ARC patients have more time,&quot; Schutzbank says. Results of the study should be available in September, he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report claims that successive regimes have passed anti-slavery legislation to appease the international community, while pursuing policies to encourage slavery.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has not released results of the last two censuses, which are suspected to indicate that the Arab ruling group now makes up less than 30 percent of the total population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Somalia, President Mohamed Siad Barre has released 45 political prisoners detained for allegedly distributing a manifesto calling for his removal. Barre also announced that multi-party elections will be held in February. Criticism of the government's human rights record intensified earlier this month after Somali security forces opened fire in a soccer stadium in Mogadishu, the capital, when crowds jeered the president. At least 100 people were shot dead or trampled in the resulting panic, according to Africa Watch.</SPAN></P>

A United Nations technical mission led by Issa Diallo, special assistant to United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, is scheduled to visit the region in early August.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission is part of the Secretary-General's attempt to establish a peace process that will end 15 years of war between Morocco and the Polisario Front, which is fighting for the independence of the former Spanish colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a June 18th report to the Security Council, Perez de Cuellar outlined in detail the steps he believes must precede a free and fair election, including a cease-fire, completion of the census, the release of Saharan political prisoners and the return of Saharan refugees from neighboring countries. The report proposes civilian, military and security units for a United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, to be called Minurso. &quot;It is clear,&quot; the report says, &quot;that the United Nations operation in Western Sahara will be large and complicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polisario has welcomed the Secretary-General's efforts to promote a settlement, while Moroccan Foreign Minister Abdellatif Filali has promised that his country will &quot;seriously examine&quot; the UN proposals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadma visits the United States later this month to see President George Bush and to encourage U.S. investment in his country, he is certain to encounter some difficult questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few weeks ago, Eyadma's ruling party, known as the Rally of the Togolese People (RPT), reaffirmed support for the current single-party political structure and warned that multi-party pressure could produce &quot;unpredictable consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview last month in West Africa magazine, Eyadma said his government has been taking steps to democratize political life. In parliamentary elections in March, 230 candidates stood for 79 positions and several non-party members won seats. &quot;This means democracy has taken root in our political life,&quot; the president said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since taking power in a 1967 coup, Eyadma has survived at least three attempts to oust him from power by force. Though he faces no visible organized opposition, he may not be immune from the problems now confronting several of Africa's other long-term leaders. Christian Science Monitor correspondent Robert Press, one of the journalists visiting Togo with a UN-organized group, reported that &quot;a growing number of Togolese are privately saying that stability has come at a high price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small west African nation of about three million residents, Togo is currently struggling to shore up its economy and establish a more attractive financial climate for investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his visit to Washington, Eyadma will seek to keep the focus on Togo's economic potential. With a sound infrastructure, a modern airport and shipping port, modern transportation, banking and communication, the country hopes to interest U.S. businesses in making the infusion of capital needed to boost development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below, Ernest Harsch looks at Togo's economic prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LOME--Often hailed as a forerunner in privatization and other market-oriented strategies for economic recovery, Togo is still striving to build a sound foundation for sustainable growth and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togolese officials express satisfaction over their country's recent economic performance. &quot;Since our country has implemented a policy of structural adjustment,&quot; says Planning Minister Barry Moussa Barque, &quot;there has been real growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet this satisfaction has been tempered by recognition that the economic improvements have been fragile and uneven and that production and investment levels have not responded to Togo's economic reform program as quickly as expected. Moreover, worrying social costs have been incurred, marked by some deterioration in health, nutrition, education and employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite fulsome praise from its aid partners and despite repeated debt reschedulings, Togo has also found few improvements in its external economic environment. World market conditions remain unfavorable and international financial support has been less than expected. &quot;The adjustment programs run so far have failed to generate an influx of foreign funds in keeping with our growth targets or our debt,&quot; says President Gnassingbe Eyadma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togo may be better endowed in terms of agricultural and mineral resources and certain infrastructure (such as a well-developed highway network) than a number of other African Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Its per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1987 was $ 290 and its adult literacy rate is about 40%; both figures are somewhat above the LDC average. But the structural weaknesses of Togo's economy and its limited capacity for overcoming them are fundamentally little different. Manufacturing's contribution to total output -- one of the key LDC indicators -- is a mere 8.5%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tough economic reforms to which the government has committed itself aim first of all at overcoming the most immediate imbalances in its economic performance. But they also are designed to prepare the basis on which the country may eventually raise itself out of the &quot;least developed&quot; category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most analyses of Togo's slide into economic crisis see the beginnings, paradoxically, in the phosphate boom of 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the first phosphate exports in 1961, the country had relied primarily on the sale of cocoa and coffee for its foreign exchange earnings.  The development of phosphate mining provided an important addition to this limited export mix and soon became Togo's principal source of growth and revenue, accounting for 61% of export earnings by the early 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late 1974, world phosphate prices quadrupled. Buoyed by a consequent doubling of its budgetary revenues the following year, the government embarked on an ambitious industrialization drive, sharply stepping up public investments and creating numerous state-owned enterprises, ranging from manufacturing to trade, marketing and banking institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phosphate prices soon plunged back down, but a boom in cocoa and coffee prices in 1975-76 kept the investment momentum rolling. The government also borrowed heavily, much of it on commercial terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This public investment drive soon proved unsustainable, in large part because export earnings fell back to pre-boom levels -- and then continued downward. With receipts well below anticipated figures, Togo began to incur large payments arrears on its external debt. Its current account balance, which had been slightly positive in 1970, was negative to the tune of $ 234 million by1978. Reflecting the commercial terms of much of Togo's borrowing, debt servicing costs rose sharply. Togo was obliged to seek repeated debt reschedulings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compounding these difficulties was the disappointing return on the large investments of the mid-to-late 1970s. Some projects had been launched hastily, without serious advance study of their costs or potential markets.  Many were weighed down by high personnel costs or crippled by &quot;bad management and corruption,&quot; President Eyadma later acknowledged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all state enterprises were inefficient or became a drain on government resources. But Minister for Interior and State Enterprises Koffi Djondo emphasizes that many functioned poorly enough to lead to a &quot;hemorrhage of our public finances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aarmed by the deteriorating situation, the Togolese government, as early as 1979, embarked on an initial series of stabilization measures. In 1982-83 it adopted a more rigorous structural adjustment program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. With a fourth structural adjustment loan now under negotiation between Togo and the Bank, Togo's is one of the longer running adjustment processes in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like other countries that use the CFA franc, which is pegged to the French franc, Togo was not in a position to employ one of the more common instruments of adjustment, currency devaluation. This meant that it had to rely to a greater extent on other adjustment measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-profitable state enterprises have been privatized or liquidated.  The civil service was reduced (largely through attrition and early retirement) by about 2,000 employees. A salary freeze was in effect from 1983 to 1986, and then again from 1988 to 1989. On top of this, a 5% &quot;solidarity&quot; tax has been levied on all public and private sector employees since 1983. Non-productive sectors saw their budgetary allocations contract: between 1982 and 1985, education's share of total government expenditure fell from 22.9% to 11.7%, while health went from 6.1% to 3.6%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been an increasing emphasis on diversification away from phosphates and on strengthening those sectors perceived as having the greatest potential for growth --agriculture and light industry. In the 1988-89 public investment program, the bulk of allocations were directed toward agriculture (35%) and infrastructure (45%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other measures were designed to strengthen the economy's traditional role as a regional warehouse. This included the expansion of facilities for goods transhipped through Togo from neighboring states, as well as a further liberalization of trade and banking regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of production levels and other macro-economic indicators, the results have been encouraging, though not spectacular. GDP has grown by an average 3.3% a year since 1985, though some government projections point to a disappointing rate of 2.5% for 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The budget deficit was brought down modestly, from a ratio of 7.7% of GDP in 1983 to 6.3% last year (despite a sharp rise in 1987 and 1988). Thanks to increased economic activity, private consumption was able to rise an average of 7.6% a year between 1984 and 1989. Inflation has been reduced from an average of 13.2% in 1980-82 to an estimated 2.1% in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the most prominent features of Togo's adjustment process has been its emphasis on privatization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus far 29 enterprises have been affected by the privatization program, which is one of the most ambitious on the continent, encompassing more than a third of all public-sector operations. The ultimate aim is to reduce state involvement to a minimum in most &quot;non-strategic&quot; economic activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 29 enterprises, ten were simply liquidated, fourteen were fully or partially privatized, and agreements are yet to be concluded on five others. Although Togolese entrepreneurs have taken shares in a few of them, external investors have tended to play the dominant role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the privatized firms, after retooling, staff reductions and rationalization of their production lines, have fared quite well. The privatized steel enterprise, now called the Societe Togolaise de Siderurgie (STS), began turning a profit within a year of its opening in 1984 and has done so every year since -- although behind the protection of a 41% tariff. &quot;I'm for tariffs,&quot; says STS's chief executive, the U.S. entrepreneur John Moore.  &quot;Industries in small countries need protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some aid officials argue that the initial divestitures gave excessive advantages to the newly privatized firms and were not clearly prepared with a view to maximizing benefits to the Togolese economy as a whole. The immediate proceeds from the sale of assets were in many cases enough to cover only the severance pay of dismissed workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togo's manufacturing sector consists of about 100 enterprises, but employs only 1% of the economically active population. Concentrated in the Lome area, it produces mainly for the domestic market -- a very small market, since Togo's population is only 3.4 million. Productivity is low and manufacturing activity is poorly integrated with the rest of the economy. About 90% of inputs are imported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the positive side, Togo has good transport and telecommunications links. Its physical infrastructure is to be strengthened further over the next few years through new investments in roads, electrical power and water supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togo also has a relatively well-developed banking system.  Nevertheless, Togolese entrepreneurs often complain about the high cost of credit, while small-scale operators find access to bank financing difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern for small businesses is not limited to the formal sector. An Artisan Division has been created within the Ministry of Industry and State Enterprises to assist Togo's significant informal sector. &quot;In many African countries the attitude is to just let the informal artisans go along on their own,&quot; says Mathey-Apossan Dossvi, head of the Artisan Division. &quot;But they're a very big force, and we need to help them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the other end of the spectrum, the government is offering special incentives to induce foreign investors to set up new manufacturing operations in Togo. In late 1989, a law was passed defining the legal status for the establishment of Export Processing Zones. For firms exporting at least three-quarters of their output and reserving 80% of their jobs for Togolese, the plan offers a 10-year tax holiday, reduced electricity and telecommunications rates and exemption from import and export duties. The project is backed by the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first companies to line up for the new export zones is John Moore's STS. He believes such generous incentives and reduced red tape are vital if Togo is to attract significant amounts of foreign investment. &quot;Africa has got to sell itself,&quot; he says. &quot;The world is not going to beat a path to its door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Potentially the strongest and most dynamic sector of the Togolese economy is agriculture. It accounts for 30% of the GDP, 30% of export earnings, and three-quarters of the economically active population. Togo has escaped the severe climatic and ecological shock that have afflicted the Sahelian states.  Nevertheless, agricultural output remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall, given the general absence of irrigation and the low level of productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's single most important step towards boosting production was to increase significantly the prices paid to producers for cocoa, coffee and cotton. Between the 1983-84 and 1986-87 crop years, producer prices for cocoa were increased by 31%, and for cotton by 50%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most spectacular response was in cotton output, with seed cotton production more than tripling between 1983 and 1989. Nearly half of Togo's approximately 260,000 smallholders are now cultivating cotton on at least part of their farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coffee output has also increased, from 10,000 tons in 1985 to 14,700 tons in 1989. The cocoa sector, however, has not fared as well, falling from 16,500 tons in 1984 to 8,000 in 1989, despite the significant increase in the producer price over most of that period. This is partly due to the age of most cocoa trees. Output figures, however, are hard to interpret because a significant portion of cocoa and coffee marketed in Togo is believed to actually originate from Ghana through illicit cross-border trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The higher producer prices and greater marketed output for cotton are believed to have had a significant impact on the incomes of a sizeable portion of the rural population. The World Bank estimates that export farmers benefited from an average 97% increase in incomes (in real terms) between 1982 and 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This progress is now being undermined, however, by the continuing collapse of world cocoa and coffee prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Office des Produits Agricoles du Togo (OPAT), the country's main agricultural export agency, has been obliged to reduce producer prices over the past two seasons by 37.5% for cocoa and 56.25% for coffee. &quot;We hope this situation changes soon,&quot; remarks OPAT Director Katanga Tcha. &quot;If not, the peasants will abandon these products.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, Togo's food situation is somewhat more favorable than in many other African countries. In non-drought years, Togolese farmers are able to meet the bulk of domestic food needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little room for complacency, however. Food production has been uneven, both geographically and by crop. The southern regions, where maize is more dominant, can often boast of surpluses. But in the north -- where climatic conditions are more unfavorable and where the production of staples like cassava and yams has stagnated -- deficits frequently occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the food sector has not benefited from the kind of incentives accorded to export crops. Between 1985-88, investments in export-crop projects were twice as high as for integrated rural development projects. Nutritional studies have shown a particular decline in food production in the cotton-growing regions, as farmers shift toward the more profitable crop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the increased concerns over the social consequences of adjustment, new policies are being formulated to bolster food production. These are to include improvements in irrigation, the expansion of cultivated land areas, the development of animal traction, the extension of roads and marketing systems in the more isolated regions and support for peasant co-operatives and local community initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A difficult external environment adds to Togo's domestic problems. In recent years, Togo has been confronted with the all-too-familiar predicament of a rising debt burden and falling terms of trade. Earlier debt restructurings led to a bunching of repayments in the latter part of the 1980s, the same years when world prices for cocoa and coffee plunged most precipitously. In 1988 alone, the country suffered $ 40 million in losses as a result of lower commodity prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the trade situation has remained bleak, the past year brought a slight improvement on the financial front. The French government wrote off $ 145 million of bilateral debt. In June 1989, Togo was able to benefit from thenew debt rescheduling terms approved by the Toronto summit, when the Paris Club of official creditors agreed to a package that helped to reduce Togo's overall debt servicing burden from $ 155 million to $100 million. As a result, Togo's actual debt repayments in 1989 were some 27% of estimated export earnings, an improvement from the 39.1% ratio of two years earlier. Nevertheless, debt servicing was again set to rise significantly in 1990, to $ 124 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Projections by the Ministry of Planning and Mines suggest that Togo will need $ 556 million in new borrowing over the period 1990-95 to finance its investment plans. But even this level may be too low, since it assumes a significant increase in export receipts based in part on higher prices for phosphates, cocoa and coffee -- the same commodities that have been faring so poorly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a number of Togo's key economic and financial indicators have shown some improvement in recent years, and while certain groups have benefited from higher incomes -- among them export crop producers -- the upturn has yet to be felt in the living standards of major sectors of the Togolese population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most troubling, many of those with the lowest incomes and least access to social services and benefits have seen a further deterioration in their position as a result of Togo's economic difficulties and of the stringent measures adopted to address them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has spurred Togolese planners and international funding agencies to place a greater accent on measures to safeguard the more vulnerable layers of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In education, Togo was able to achieve major gains in the 1970s, including an increase in the primary school enrollment rate from 40% to 72%.  But between 1981 and 1985, as a result of the cuts in educational spending, the rate slipped back down to 55% of the school-age population before rising to 58% by 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health presents a similar picture. Following significant improvements in the 1970s, the crisis years of 1980-83 brought a sharp cut in real per capita health expenditures by 30%. Some cuts were subsequently restored, but by 1986, real spending per person was still one-fourth less than in 1980.  Typically, rural areas suffered the greatest deterioration. Supplies of medicines and medical equipment fell drastically in many health clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first half of the 1980s, unemployment had increased to an estimated 20-25% of those active in the formal sector. Government estimates indicate that by 1989, in addition to 2,000 positions trimmed from the civil service, 6,000 Togolese had lost jobs in state-owned enterprises, while another 10,000 were made jobless in the private sector. Few of the newly unemployed received any benefits or assistance in finding new jobs. Several new investment agreements, especially in the textile industry, promise to create thousands of additional jobs in the next few years. Yet overall, new job creation has proved slower than expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the view of Planning Minister Barry Moussa Barque, Togo would have fared worse had it had not opted for the rigors of structural adjustment: &quot;This liberalism will create more jobs than the state interventionism that we had before,&quot; Barque says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, concern is growing that further deterioration in Togolese living standards may spur social upheaval, as it has in several neighboring countries. &quot;We needn't be surprised if in Africa we have social problems,&quot; remarks President Eyadma. &quot;If people don't find food to eat, they will go out and demonstrate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking to address such concerns, the next structural adjustment program, Togo's fourth, is expected to place a major emphasis on the protection and strengthening of the social sector.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tanzania's economic reform program is threatened, says its president Ali Hassan Mwinyi, by an &quot;unequal partnership in world trade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 1970's and early 1980's, the east African country's terms of trade -- the value of its exports compared to its imports -- declined 30%.  World market prices for Tanzania's traditional export crops, primarily coffee and tea, plummeted, while the cost of essential imports such as oil rose sharply. In addition, the volume as well as the value of Tanzanian exports fell -- 25% in just over a decade -- reflecting lower farm productivity and bottlenecks in transportation and marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of those combined factors, Tanzania's foreign earnings were slashed by more than half, while the cost of servicing the national debt rose to 50% of all export revenues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial crisis has meant a reversal in several areas where Tanzanians were proud of their progress. Although one of the world's poorest countries at independence in 1961, Tanzania managed to achieve growth rates averaging over 4% during the next decade and a half. It established schools and health clinics within the reach of almost every citizen, and adult literacy approached an extraordinary 90%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Tanzanians complain of schools without books or paper, clinics without medicines, village water taps that are dry, electrical systems that don't work and roads that have become impassable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems have deepened, despite seven years of stringent economic reforms -- the first three under a Tanzanian-designed program and more recently under an Economic Recovery Program (ERP) mandated by the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzanian officials admit to missteps on the path to economic development. &quot;We agree we mismanaged the economy,&quot; says Finance Minister Stephen Kibona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the faults, according to government officials, was lip service to rural development. Despite much talk of agricultural production goals and building rural infrastructure, national budgets devoted a disproportionate share of resources to industrial development. &quot;The biggest mistake we made,&quot; says Agriculture Minister Stephen Wassira, &quot;was the disinvestment in agriculture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem was the growth of state-run enterprises, despite a lack of skilled administrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those difficulties would have been far less serious, say Tanzanians, if the external economic environment had not become hostile towards poor, commodity-dependent countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Tanzania was strained by two international problems closer to home. In 1977, the breakup of the East African Community -- an economic union of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda -- forced Tanzania to suddenly develop, at great expense, its own postal, telecommunications and transportation systems. The following year, Idi Amin in neighboring Uganda decided to annex a portion of western Tanzania, saying the border between the two countries should be the &quot;natural boundary&quot; formed by the Kagera River.  Tanzania went to war to win back the territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the world drop in commodity prices and the escalation of oil prices which left Tanzania spending a full 60% of its foreign earnings just to purchase fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania's current crisis &quot;is not so much a question of internal policy,&quot; insists President Ali Hassan Mwinyi. &quot;It is the result of the unfavorable economic order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We produce cotton, tea, coffee, cashew nuts,&quot; Mwinyi says. &quot;But the prices of these things are fixed by other people, not by us.&quot; At the same time, Mwinyi says, Tanzania has to accept whatever prices are demanded for the imports it buys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conversation with journalists that covered a number of questions, Mwinyi said Tanzanians are free to adopt a multi-party system, although he characterized Tanzania's one party as inclusive and democratic. Asked whether Tanzanians will abandon socialism in light of the developments in Eastern Europe, the president said Tanzanian socialism is the concept called &quot;ujamaa&quot; in Swahili. It means communal living, he said, &quot;which is translated as socialism for want of a better translation.&quot; In Tanzania, Mwinyi said, 95% of farming activity -- including commercial farming -- is in private hands, as is 80% of the transportation sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his conversation with visiting journalists, President Ali Hassan Mwinyi was most concerned to explain Tanzania's views on economic recovery.  Here are excerpts from what he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT ALI HASSAN MWINYI: I thought I might use this opportunity to emphasize some of our preoccupations in this country. Our main preoccupation, understandably, is to revitalize our economy and promote sustained development. Some of you, I'm sure, will recall that in the late '70s to mid-'80s, our economy was characterized by acute shortages of food, consumer goods, fuel, and foreign exchange, because of the declining production in both the agricultural sector and the industrial sector. Our GDP (Gross Domestic Product) had reached a negative growth rate of minus 1.6%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of that trend in our economy, we decided to enter into negotiations with the IMF. And in 1986 we reached an agreement on a three-year Economic Recovery Program, or ERP. The implementation of that Program has yielded some results, good ones too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, since then food production has increased remarkably. We have now moved from acute food shortages to self-sufficiency in our major foodstuffs, such as maize, beans, and, to a certain extent, rice. These are the major foodstuffs consumed in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, our cash crop production has also increased substantially. Our major obstacle now is the persistent decline in the world prices of our export commodities. For example, the price of coffee dropped from L3,000 a ton just two or three years ago, to just about L600. You could work out the percentage.  It is an enormous percentage. The price of cloves, which are produced in the island part of Tanzania, dropped from $ 9,000 per ton in 1982 to just $1,700 perton. The price of cotton has been fluctuating during the three years of our ERP period. Therefore the collapse of world commodity prices frustrates our efforts to increase our foreign exchange earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three, our industrial capacity utilization has improved considerably because of the increased availability of raw materials and spares. Industrial output increased by 4.2% in 1987 and by 5.4% in 1988. This increased production has reduced the shortage of industrial consumer goods in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four, the rate of inflation declined from 33% before the implementation of the Economic Recovery Program to an average of 23% in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five, in view of the increased production in the agricultural and industrial sectors, our GDP has improved from its negative trend to an encouraging, positive rate of growth. In the first year of the ERP, our GDP growth was 3.6%. In the second it rose to 3.9%. And last year it grew to 4.1%.  So there is an obvious upward trend. This is a remarkable improvement, expecially when one considers that the rate of population growth in Tanzania is 2.8%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I acknowledge that great challenges still lie ahead of us and we still have enormous economic problems, despite these successes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first phase of the ERP, we had to put great emphasis on increased production in order to reduce the acute shortages and foreign exchange. It was not possible at emphasis on the rehabilitation of the basic social services, because of our limited capability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of that, the essential social services in the country sharply deteriorated. We have schools without adequate numbers of desks. We have dispensaries and health centers and even hospitals without adequate provision of drugs. Only 50% of the population enjoy clean water. We had planned to do more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we have adopted a second phase of the Economic Recovery Program.  This one is called the Economic and Social Action Program, which puts greater emphasis on the rehabilitation and improvement of essential social services such as education, health, and clean water. In this respect, we hope to receive ample support from our friends in our determination to improve the economic and social welfare of our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having talked about the success aspect of our efforts in economic recovery, we should also mention something about the after-effects of our efforts to improve the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the IMF conditionalities have not been yielding good results.  And the effect has been somewhat counterproductive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, one major conditionality of the IMF is that a country should devalue its currency massively, not just a little, but massively. In our case, we devalued from 17 shillings to the dollar in 1986 to now nearly 200 shillings to the dollar. This means we have devalued to the tune of 900%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country like ours, a developing country, which gets all her needs from imports, and in this case where &cent;the prices of/ imports have increased by 900%, the result, as I said, can be somewhat counterproductive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because what happened? The prices of fertilizers became beyond the reach of our people. The prices of tractors, which are essential for farming, for production, have also become beyond the reach of our people. The price of imported trucks have also become unaffordable to our people. And these are the most essential tools for production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if improvement in the economy needs production, then production here is being stifled by prices which we cannot afford because of this massive devaluation, which was one of the conditions necessary so that the IMF would listen to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you know, production requires transportation. You have to transport what you produce. About 80% of the transport in our country is in the hands of private people. These people used to buy a truck, a new truck, for 500,000 Tanzanian shillings. Now the same truck costs 6 million shillings. This is beyond the reach of our ordinary transporters. We are obviously heading toward a standstill. There will come a time when these trucks and all these means of transport will not be repairable, and so they fall by the wayside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So whilst our production is increasing, our capability for transport is decreasing. And this is one of the aftereffects of the massive devaluation insisted on by the IMF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, devaluation endangers the real incomes of our people. They sharply reduce purchasing power. And as a result of this you have the usual social effects of embezzlement, corruption, theft, simply to make ends meet.  Not necessarily that these people are bad people, but their monthly earnings have been so much eroded that they cannot meet their basic needs for 30 days.  So they spend their salary in six days, seven days, eight days, ten days. Then they have got to do something to make sure they survive until the end of the month when they get another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another ill-effect of the conditionalities of the IMF is the insistence on high interest rates, in our case of 30%. The idea was that we have inflation in the country because there's a lot of money floating in the hands of the population -- so do something to suck in this money. One way of doing it is to give an incentive, raise the interest rate to 30% so that people will think, &quot;Well, if I can get 30% with my money why should I bother to find other activities?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, our experience is that this is very well in Europe, this is true in developed countries. But in our country, this does not work. It does not work to the interests of the country, for various reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first place, the banks are far between. We have banks in Dar es Salaam. The next place you get banks is in Morogoro, 120 miles away. After Morogoro, you find banks in Dodoma, 300 kilometers away. Which peasant in his senses would risk to walk miles to the nearest bank, carrying his money with him, to deposit it in order to get 30% interest?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This condition was all right in 1945 Germany, during the Marshall Plan. Germany had everything. All infrastructure was there. But here in Tanzania this is not the case. The interest rates are high, and yet very few people deposit their money in the banks because the banks are not there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, we encourage private people, cooperatives, and certain crop-purchasing authorities to buy all the crops that we have asked our population to produce. We say that nobody should produce and then find themselves at a loss to find a market. But these people, these crop-buying authorities, have no money of their own. They have to go to the bank to borrow, at 30%, in order to buy the crops from the farmers. But when they have bought these crops, as I said earlier, transport is difficult. They keep hanging on to what they have bought, while the interest clock, if I can put it that way, ticks. So this man holds on to what he has bought for three, four, five, six months, with the money he has borrowed at 30%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are some of the problems that we have encountered in the course of the implementation of the ERP Program, that we have had with our friend, the IMF.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">844 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former British colony of Tanzania on Africa's Indian Ocean coast and the former French colony of Togo on the Atlantic side of the continent are more than 2,000 miles apart. Their histories, cultures and political systems are radically different. But in the 1990s they face similar -- and daunting -- challenges. Both are classified by the United Nations as Least Developed Countries (LDCs), a roster of the world's poorest nations. Tanzania has been on the list since its independence in 1961, while Togo toppled onto it in 1982 -- one of several African countries to be reclassified during the last decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like most of their African neighbors, Togo and Tanzania have economies that were built around the production of a limited number of export crops. The practice was introduced by colonial powers and was intensified after independence by African governments themselves. Relying on the advice of international financial experts, African countries borrowed money for ambitious development schemes based on the anticipated earnings of their commodity exports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When commodity prices plummeted in the mid-1970s while interest rates rose, many countries entered a cycle of debt and economic crisis from which they have been unable to escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For several years now, both Tanzania and Togo have been implementing economic austerity and reform programs supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The international financial institutions believe that their formulas offer Africa its only hope for economic recovery and development. The IMF wants African countries to trim bloated bureaucracies, discourage costly imports and stimulate the private sector. At the same time, though, on the theory of &quot;comparative advantage,&quot; the international institutions are encouraging the continuing expansion of commodity production as the best method of earning foreign exchange for most countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing numbers of African economists, on the other hand, say that African countries must devise reform schemes that emphasize feeding their people over export earnings and that diversify production away from a few primary commodities. They also argue for plans that devote a larger percentage of resources to social programs and that measure progress by improvements in the quality of life as well as by such statistical indicators as the rate of economic growth. In addition, they say, there must be relief from the crushing burden of debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank has given some of its critics hope that it has heard their pleas for increased focus on the effects of reform policies on the poor.  On July 16, the Bank issued a study called Poverty (see publications list, page 13, for ordering information). The study says donors should allocate aid based on the extent to which borrowing governments convincingly demonstrate a commitment to reducing poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Africa, though, the report is grim. In an introduction, World Bank President Barber Conable says that reducing the number of the world's poor by 400 million people is a feasible goal for this decade but predicts that poverty in sub-Saharan Africa will continue to increase. For the African region, the goal is &quot;containing the number of poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, welcomed the report as &quot;putting poverty back on the political agenda.&quot; More cautiously, the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker group, joined the aid agency CARE to issue a statement warning that the lending arms of the Bank and the IMF might ignore the new emphasis. The groups say the Bank still &quot;appears blind to the need to boost self-reliance in developing countries.&quot; Still, the two groups say the report offers a &quot;glimmer of hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But poor countries are increasingly fearful that their problems will get less and less attention in a world whose attention is turning towards Europe. Those fears appeared justified earlier this month at the economic summit of Western nations and Japan in Houston, Texas, where Third World issues got scant attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, development specialists are making various efforts to insure that those issues do get considered. In Houston, a conference called The Other Economic Summit gathered economists and development workers from around the world in an attempt to call attention to a broader range of issues than the heads of government were considering. The participants planned a series of follow-up activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the continuing debate, the question of whether or not existing structural adjustment programs are working has become a critical one for both supporters and critics of IMF-style reforms. A group of international journalists recently explored that question on a visit to Tanzania and Togo organized by the United Nations. Following are excerpts from an interview the journalists had with the Tanzanian president and from an article on Togo that appears in the current issue of the United Nations publication Africa Recovery by staff writer Ernest Harsch, who was on the trip.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Excerpts from an Africa News interview with President Sam Nujoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Namibia is said by many constitutional scholars to have some of the best protections for civil liberties of any country.  Can you imagine any circumstances under which you might feel the need to suspend these rights?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: The President is required to take such actions if there is a threat to freedom of the people and the territorial integrity of Namibia -- being invaded by a foreign power. But at the present moment I do not foresee such a threat at all.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We suffered under colonial occupation for the last 106 years. As we were struggling, we believed that the people must have the right to self-determination. They must have freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to determine whom they would like to elect as their leaders. This we leave to the people. This is precisely why the people of Namibia went into war, in order to restore their legitimate rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Are you willing to have an independent press which can closely scrutinize the government?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: We welcome the press to report objectively, and it is the right of Namibian citizens to know what is happening in the country. The press is there to report to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How do you feel about the provision that limits a president to serving two terms?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: We feel that other Namibian citizens should be given the opportunity to participate and to contribute to the country -- and not just one man for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How do you plan to implement the constitutional mandate for equality of the sexes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: First of all we have to ensure that women attend schools right from childhood up to the university level -- and also ensure that there will be equal pay for equal jobs and equal treatment in all spheres of life. And we have to ensure that women are attracted to participate in all the activities and the organs of the state, as well as in public life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Have you dealt adequately with the issue of the detainees Swapo held during the war?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, yes. The opposition claimed that we have detainees in foreign countries. We do not. Swapo has no detainees any longer. We have students -- particularly the children under the age of 18 who could not participate in the elections -- in our schools in Zambia, and we have foreigners who are teachers and doctors at those hospitals, but we have no more detainees. And I believe we will discuss this as we discuss other issues that are affecting our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: But many people in this country still want to know why Swapo detained its members and apparently tortured some of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: During the war, the South African government recruited our own people into its war machinery -- into Koevoet &cent;a paramilitary police unit known for its brutality/ and SWATF &cent;the South West African Territorial Force, a military unit set up by the South African army/. As a result of the actions of our own people who were recruited by the enemy, thousands of Namibians were massacred. In the massacre at Kassinga in 1978, more than a thousand people were killed and maimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we were bound to take action in order to protect our people. Had the enemy agents succeeded, there could have been no freedom and independence in Namibia today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, we have created a unified national army, composed of ex-Koevoet, ex-SWATF -- despite the fact that they have committed crimes. Some of our people are very angry that Swapo is &quot;selling out&quot; by integrating these elements who have been killing the people during the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: In light of those emotions, how are you progressing towards your goal of &quot;national reconciliation&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: It's going very well. With the difficulties that are there -- the bitterness -- the wounds are still fresh. As you are aware, there are many who lost dear ones. Some villages have been completely wiped out by the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But our policy is to close and leave behind this sad history and to start a new page of history, where we have to forge ahead with immediate burning issues -- to build schools and hospitals, to embark upon economic projects such as agriculture in order to produce adequate food for the population. We can't be looking backwards, we have to move forwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Namibia already has an economically privileged white population.  Are you at all worried that you might develop, as other nations have, a privileged elite alongside a poor majority?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Precisely. We are aware of that. That's why our priority in economic development is agriculture. The main aim is to produce food for our population. And the secondary is to provide clean water for the population, as well as to provide education and health and housing. We have learned in the struggle that our responsibility is not to enjoy the fruit of independence, but our duty and responsibility is to build a stronger foundation for the future generations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK--Three months after their country's long-awaited independence, Namibians are facing the same problem they confronted during decades of campaigning for freedom -- getting attention on a world stage dominated by better known actors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Sam Nujoma, Sam;ujoma's first American visit as head of state was announced last month, many U.S. friends of Namibia were fearful that it would be completely overshadowed by Nelson Mandela, Nelson;andela's U.S.  tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nujoma's one-week journey netted Namibia tangible results despite a paucity of press coverage. The 61-year-old leader held what he termed a &quot;very fruitful&quot; meeting with President George Bush, George;.i.Bush, George;ush, signed an important bilateral agreement and met with many of the top policy and opinion makers in Washington. And he witnessed governments from around the world make commitments of more than $ 200 million to Namibia's development needsduring a two-day donors' pledging conference at the United Nations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an Oval Office meeting with President George Bush and other U.S.  officials, Nujoma praised American support for the United Nations-sponsored independence process. Nujoma says he briefed Bush &quot;on how busy we are establishing a democratic society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush responded by congratulating the Namibian president on his &quot;pragmatic&quot; political and economic policies, according to Herman Co.i.Cohen, Herman Cohen, Herman;hen, the assistant secretary of State for Africa, who took part in the half-hour talk. Secretary of State James Baker, who led the American delegation to the independence celebrations, also attended the meeting, as did national security advisor Brent Scowcroft, his deputy, Robert Gates, and several other State Department officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high-level presence -- unusual for such a session -- was a measure of the kind of interest that has been sparked by Namibia's moves towards democratization.  &quot;Around here Nujoma was regarded as a somewhat inept leader of a rag-tag army,&quot; one U.S. official said. &quot;There were plenty of people predicting that Namibia would turn out to be just another failed African leftist dictatorship.&quot; Now that Nujoma has emerged as a statesman representing democracy and economic pluralism, the official said, &quot;they just wanted to get a look at the guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day of the meeting, the White House announced the selection of the first ambassador to Namibia, Genta Hawkins Holmes, Genta Hawkins, currently the second ranking U.S. diplomat in South Africa. Nujoma announced that Namibia will open an embassy in Washington as soon as arrangements can be completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the U.S. trip, Nujoma stressed his theme that Namibians are determined to work hard and to sacrifice --&quot;even to eat only once a day&quot;-- to insure that future generations &quot;do not have to suffer the same consequences we suffered under South African colonial domination.&quot; Because of the colonial experience, he said, Namibia is among the least developed countries in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we seek international assistance, we do not want to become perpetually dependent on foreign aid,&quot; he said in several appearances. Namibia is particularly eager, Nujoma said, to gain self-sufficiency in food production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The central features of my government's policy are the consolidation of independence, national reconciliation, and the fostering of peace, unity, economic and social well-being for all our people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma was upbeat during his visit, and he was clearly pleased by the response to his appeal for assistance and foreign investment. &quot;We are leaving prepared to go and embark on agricultural projects, water development, education and health, and better houses,&quot; he said in an interview near the end of his stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After 30 years at the helm of the independence movement Swapo (South West Africa People's Organization), Nujoma has grown accustomed to making a case for Namibia's significance. On his most recent previous U.S. visit -- a four-city tour in mid-1988 -- he issued an appeal that Americans &quot;don't forget Namibia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, his reiterated request not to overlook his country was bolstered by his position as head of new democracy. His appeal also got a boost from Mandela, who on several occasions cited Namibia as an example of a working non-racial successor to an apartheid regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Capitol Hill, Nujoma held separate meetings with House and Senate members. He thanked legislators who &quot;championed the cause&quot; of Namibian independence and expressed appreciation for recent efforts to boost foreign aid to his country. The U.S., which had only planned to give Namibia about $ 500,000in assistance this year, has now committed $ 10 million as a result of Congressional action taken prior to Nujoma's arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma attracted a good turnout at all of his Washington appearances.  The auditorium at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace was filled to near-capacity for his off-the-record talk, and there were more people than places for the dinner and question session which followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), another large gathering of African specialists from government, journalism, and academia asked Nujoma and his delegation about a wide range of issues -- from the economy to the ecology of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioners at the two Washington think-tank sessions zeroed in on various provisions of the Namibian constitution which offer guarantees for a range of personal freedoms similar to the American Bill of Rights. At Carnegie, Nujoma promised that civil liberties will not be abridged in Namibia as they have in many other countries. At CSIS, he said the clause granting equal rights to women will result in opening opportunities for women &quot;in all aspects of national development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One participant in the CSIS meeting, Laurie Marker-Kraus from the Smithsonian Institution's National Zoological Park, presented Nujoma with a silver cheetah pin in recognition of Namibia's constitutional protections for wildlife. Namibia has the largest population of cheetahs in the world and holds the key to their survival as a species, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president was repeatedly queried about his economic policies and specifically about nationalization. &quot;Our constitution does not provide for wholesale nationalization,&quot; he said. But if the parliament at some point decided some takeovers were required, he said, &quot;adequate compensation will be paid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He emphasized Namibia's commitment to a &quot;dynamic role&quot; for the private sector, which he called &quot;the engine for growth and prosperity.&quot; The government's role will be limited to involvement in a few key sectors -- agriculture, education, health and housing, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While in Washington, Nujoma signed an agreement with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a U.S. government agency which gives backing to American firms doing business abroad. OPIC provides direct loans, loan guarantees and offers insurance against the risk of political violence. &quot;We don't assure investors that they will earn a profit,&quot; said James D. Berg, acting president of the agency, &quot;but in partnership with national governments, OPIC assures that risks be minimized.&quot; Nujoma said he hoped the agreement would &quot;consolidate the friendship&quot; between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Nujoma said he was particularly encouraged by the outcome of the two-day UN donors' pledging conference, which he termed &quot;a resounding success.&quot; With over $ 200 million committed from governments and international agencies, Namibia will be able to begin many of its development schemes, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Finance Minister Otto Herrigel, the pledges were &quot;more than we expected.&quot; It is &quot;extremely encouraging,&quot; he said, &quot;to see the solidarity shown by many of our friends and even by some who haven't been friends before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a group, the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) made the largest pledge at the UN conference -- about $ 60 million for this year, all on a grant basis.  Two other European governments made substantial three-year commitments. The West Germans pledged about $ 60 million,while the British pledged about $ 17 million. (However, the German contribution may turn out to be substantially less, since it includes a large loan, and Namibia is seeking to avoid additional indebtedness.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa offered $ 10 million, while Nigeria and Egypt said they would contribute $ 1 million each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian team presented to the donors conference a general policy statement on the reconstruction and development of the country. According to National Planning Commission Director General Zedekia Ngavirue, Namibia needs about $ 200 million a year to implement the development plan, plus some $70 million annually to offset a budget deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pledges received represent &quot;an impressive beginning&quot; towards that $ 810 million three-year figure, Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab said in an interview. &quot;We did not really expect that we would emerge at the end of this pledging conference with the whole amount that we will need for the next three years, but we are greatly encouraged by the outcome,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nujoma appealed to private investors as well as governments while in the U.S.  He announced plans to hold a conference for foreign business interests in Windhoek in the next few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview on Cable News Network, the president said he hoped that Namibia's rich mineral wealth and prospects for oil would interest American investors. &quot;The Namibian government is creating an environment conducive for private investment,&quot; he said in another public appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one prominent American businessman, Maurice Tempelsman, Namibia has already gone a long way towards creating &quot;a good atmosphere.&quot; Although Tempelsman said it was &quot;a bit early&quot; to expect specific plans to emerge, &quot;everything that has been done up to the present time has enhanced the environment in which the private sector likes to operate.&quot; He cited the new investment code now being drawn up by the government and the conclusion of the OPIC treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tempelsman, a diamond merchant with extensive business involvement in Africa, is chairman of the African-American Institute in New York. He hosted a dinner for the Namibian president with members of two large business organizations to discuss the country's economic plans. Both Templesman's firm and Rossing Uranium Company, a British-owned mining concern, provided logistical assistance to the Namibians for the president's visit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although African heads of state at this month's annual meeting of the Organization of African Unity acknowledged the need for accountable government, pro-democracy advocates are facing tough going in many African nations. In Kenya, this month's arrest of government critics is the largest crackdown on opponents since President Daniel arap Moi came to power in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the continent in Liberia, six months of fighting have failed to dislodge strongman president Samuel K. Doe. But last week, plans for a meeting of all Liberia's leading political forces gave rise to hopes that an interim government might be established -- if Doe can be persuaded or forced to relinquish control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort was spearheaded by a group of about 100 Liberians exiled in neighboring Sierra Leone who called for a meeting of representatives of &quot;all existing parties&quot; and of Liberians now living in various foreign countries. The ultimate aim, the statement says, is &quot;the speedy establishment of multiparty democracy through free and fair elections.&quot; In the meantime, the exiles say, the representatives should establish an interim government to oversee repatriation of displaced Liberians and organize the voting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement, issued in the Sierra Leone capital Freetown, where negotiations aimed at ending the Liberian conflict have been taking place, offers an alternative to a direct assumption of power by the rebel forces headed by Charles Taylor, which have been fighting to oust Doe since late last December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Freetown statement, co-signed by the leaders of several Liberian political groups and quickly endorsed by senior religious figures, was distributed during an apparent stalemate in the talks between the government and Taylor's National Patriotic Front, whose forces are in control of large parts of Liberia and are poised on the outskirts of the capital, Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sierra Leone group calls upon Doe &quot;to make good his promise to the Liberian people that he would step aside should they ask him to do so.&quot; The interim government would be headed by the Patriotic Front, it says, but would include members of every other party and exile group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is something on which we can now build,&quot; says Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a prominent exiled Liberian leader and former Cabinet minister. &quot;If this gets off the ground, it will put pressure on Doe to resign,&quot; she suggested in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan for an all-party meeting is the first indication of possible movement in the current stand-off, which has seen Taylor's forces march to the capital with little resistance, only to stall at the city's edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the rebels have been unable or unwilling to make a final assault against Doe is unclear. There are reports of a split in the ranks, and there have been suggestions that Taylor fears a reaction from the United States if his forces invade the capital. Taylor is said by some associates to believe that Washington might stage a Panama-type action, using Marines now stationed on U.S. naval vessels that have been deployed off Liberia's coast for a potential evacuation of Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia is host for several strategic U.S. installations, which handle diplomatic and intelligence traffic throughout Africa and guide U.S. shipping in the Atlantic. There is also a key Voice of America transmitter outside Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lull in the fighting early last week led to a large-scale exodus from Monrovia, where an increasing but undetermined number of residents have been injured or killed by government soldiers. But most Monrovians remain trapped in the city, with water and food in short supply, electrical service erratic, and telephones out of commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suffering has also been on the rise in several refugee settlements as food and water have been exhausted, according to accounts from relief workers in Guinea, where many of the uprooted Liberians have fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Freetown statement appeals to the Patriotic Front &quot;to strictly observe due respect for human rights and civil liberty&quot; and to avoid acts of vengeance and summary executions. A similar plea has been broadcast by Liberian religious leaders, who have called on both the government and the rebels to stop the bloodshed. Many Liberians are worried that a rebel takeover could lead to the installation of another authoritarian regime, although the Patriotic Front has promised to hold elections after taking control of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An interfaith committee of both Christians and Muslims has been trying to negotiate an end to the conflict and to insure the beginning of a democratic process. Mediation efforts by the committee and by the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) faltered after Doe refused to give up power. The Patriotic Front is holding to the demand for his ouster as a precondition for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparent breakthrough came last Wednesday when Tom Woewiyu, the Front's representative in the peace talks, returned to Sierra Leone from Liberia with word that rebel leader Taylor had accepted the terms of the Freetown statement, which also won the endorsement of religious leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the parties can agree on an interim administration whose representatives are drawn from all major sectors of society, Liberian exiles say, the chances for a peaceful resolution will increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, in Kenya, President Moi is coming under increasing pressure to open up the political process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist church leaders have asked the president &quot;as a matter of extreme urgency&quot; to create a &quot;mechanism through which Kenyans from all walks of life will discuss, consult, listen to one another.&quot; The appeal came in a July 14 statement that also condemned the recent violence and promised to &quot;uphold the president with ceaseless prayers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day, sermons throughout the country addressed the current crisis, and one prominent Anglican bishop, Henry Okullu, said it was time for Kenyans &quot;to elect a new and proper government.&quot; Moi responded with renewed threats against church leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Moi's administration, the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu) has grown increasingly powerful -- and since 1982 has been the only political party legally allowed to operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public protests against continued one-party rule resulted in 20 deaths earlier this month, according to the official toll. At least 28 government opponents have been detained, including two former Cabinet ministers, Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi has blamed the current troubles on disgruntled Kikuyus -- members of the country's largest ethnic group which dominated the government under Moi's predecessor, Jomo Kenyatta. But protests against the government have taken place in many parts of the country, and several non-Kikuyu's are among the detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued resistance to pluralism is likely to cost Kenya economically. The U.S. has criticized recent government actions, and a joint declaration by the Nordic countries condemned what they called the &quot;brutal&quot; government response to its critics. The five countries -- Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden -- said they will &quot;reconsider their economic assistance&quot; of about $ 80 million a year &quot;if the present political situation continues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, several members of Congress have asked the Bush administration to &quot;immediately freeze current assistance&quot; and to &quot;reconsider&quot; the request for fiscal year 1991. U.S. aid this years totals $ 46 million, including $ 10 million in military assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congressional appeal was made in a July 12 letter signed by five Democrats -- House Majority Whip William Gray, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Dante Fascell, the House and Senate Africa subcommittee chairmen, Howard Wolpe and Paul Simon, and Gus Yatron, who chairs the House subcommittee on human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although most of this year's aid money already has been dispensed to Kenya, the letter says there is $ 8 million in unobligated development funds and$ 5 million in recently released military aid that should be held up &quot;until there is a marked improvement in the human rights situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An earlier letter from Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell asked Secretary of State James Baker III to make clear that relations between Kenya and the United States &quot;will deteriorate unless significant steps are taken to reinstitute respect for basic human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure to cut off American assistance was boosted by the arrival in Washington last week of Gibson Kamau Kuria, a prominent Kenyan human rights lawyer who was allowed to leave the country after seeking refuge in the American embassy to avoid arrest. In meetings on Capitol Hill, Kuria said that outsiders currently hold the key to change in Kenya, because the government has steadily eroded constitutional protections of dissent for its own citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the multiparty campaigning by prominent Kenyan politicians, the government faces a less tangible threat from an underground movement that has waged a grass roots anti-Moi crusade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, a group called Mwakenya -- the major underground force -- distributed leaflets throughout the country calling for increased pressure on Moi to resign. This month, a seven-page Mwakenya statement on the current situation was released in London by the well-known Kenyan novelist and playwright, Ngugi wa Thiong'o. &quot;Moi and Kanu must go,&quot; the statement says. The group wants to see parliament dissolved, a new constitution written, and multiparty elections held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a long-time government critic, Ngugi only recently became publicly identified with Mwakenya, whose other members remain clandestine -- most of them inside Kenya, he said in an interview. With himself as spokesperson, the movement can speak out more forcefully -- and defend itself against &quot;Moi's accusations and lies,&quot; said the writer, who teaches part time at Yale University and lives in exile in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The time is right, Ngugi said, to build a broad coalition with church leaders, lawyers, intellectuals, and Kenyans from all backgrounds to force Moi from office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most analysts expect Moi to hold on to his position for the foreseeable future. He is said to be considering several reforms, including a restructuring of Kanu to allow greater participation and debate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After months of controversy among his advisors over whether or not he should do it, Pope John Paul last week consecrated Our Lady of Peace Basilica in Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire. About 10,000 people were inside the lavish church for the dedication service, while another 80,000 were in the courtyard, built to resemble St. Peter's Square in Rome.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The structure, with its marble floors and columns, hand-made stained-glass windows and mahogany pews cost an estimated $ 200 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Polish pope thanked Cote d'Ivoire President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who is said to have used his own funds to build the church, and the pontiff said he would return to bless the hospital that is to be built in the Basilica complex. Vatican officials said earlier, privately, that the Pope had decided to dedicate the church, only after extracting Houphouet-Boigny's pledge to build both a hospital and a social services center on the grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security for the ceremonies was tight, as the government feared the dedication might become a focus for the pro-democracy protests that have marked life in Cote d'Ivoire since last spring. Critics had said such expenditure on a church was scandalous in a poor country that is experiencing an economic crisis.</SPAN></P>

The teleconference was hosted by two House Democrats, Ronald Dellums (CA) who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus and Howard Wolpe (MI) who chairs the subcommittee on Africa, along with Republican John Kasich of Ohio.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The session, characterized as a &quot;frank exchange of views&quot; -- a description that usually means a heated disagreement -- was arranged by the law firm of Washington, Perito, and Dubuc, which represents the Angolan government in Washington, D.C. The U.S. government has withheld recognition from Luanda since Angola became independent from Portugal in 1975. The Reagan and Bush administrations have backed the Angolan rebel movement Unita with officially covert, but widely acknowledged, military aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Wednesday, the House Intelligence Committee, in secret session, is reported to have defeated by two votes an attempt by several Democrats to reduce the covert aid package for fiscal year 1991 or to attach conditions to it. The administration's proposed aid increase for Unita is now expected to be debated by the full House later this year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana's district assemblies are responding angrily to criticism leveled at them from the Movement for Freedom and Justice (MFJ), a group that was unveiled at an August 1st press conference. Headed by historian Adu Boahen, the MFJ says its goal is a multi-party democracy to replace the nine-year-old government of the Provisional National Defense Council (PNDC). The MFJ charges that public discussions are impossible in Ghana because of an &quot;atmosphere of fear, suspicion and intimidation&quot; caused by curbs on free expression. And the group says Ghana's district assemblies, a third of whose members are government appointed, have failed to fulfill their promise as representatives of popular opinion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Accra assembly called the MFJ statement &quot;arrogant&quot; and the Bawku West assembly said the district structures were &quot;the most democratic in Ghana's history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assemblies were elected last year as part of a PNDC plan to reintroduce democratic structures in Ghana at local and regional levels before holding national elections. Ghana's head of state, Jerry Rawlings, whose popularly-supported 1981 coup overthrew an ineffective and unpopular elected government, says the country's negative experiences at the ballot box shows the need for strong grassroots structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the last year, doubts about the PNDC commitment to democracy have been growing, as has impatience with the slow pace of change. Although the leadership of the Trade Union Congress supports PNDC policies, at its last congress in 1988, the union federation called for a multi-party system and for repeal of laws allowing arbitrary government action against critics. Ghana's Catholic bishops have recently called for &quot;free, frank and open discussion&quot; on national issues and demanded the unbanning of the church newspaper, the Standard, which was closed six years ago. And after the MFJ announced its existence, officials of the National Union of Ghana Students told Africa News they will press the PNDC to develop a specific program to restore a multi-party system and to effect its own retirement from the scene.  --with files from Kwame Karikari in Accra</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Operation Lifeline Sudan, a United Nations-sponsored agency formed to get food to starving Sudanese, is on the brink of collapse, warns Roger Winter, director of the United States Committee for Refugees. Lifeline was mandated to secure the agreement of both the Sudanese government of Lieutenant General Omar Hassan al-Bashir and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) that is fighting his rule to allow neutral humanitarian aid into all areas of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Winter, just back from the Horn of Africa, says Lifeline's work has been compromised by government attempts to deny food to rebel areas -- and by the acquiescence of Lifeline officials in what Winter calls government &quot;manipulation.&quot; Winter cites recent Lifeline efforts to curtail the work of relief organizations that operate outside the Lifeline umbrella.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPLM is on the verge, Winter says, of withdrawing its cooperation from Lifeline efforts, although there is hope that a newly-appointed Lifeline coordinator, Per Janvid of Sweden, can re-establish good relations. SPLM leader John Garang has already accepted an invitation from Janvid to meet to discuss the situation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the latest critique of his human rights policies, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire has shown he hasn't lost his diplomatic touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long known for keeping opponents off balance with unexpected moves -- such as naming Nguza Karl-i-Bond, a critic who had been convicted of treason and sentenced to death, to be Zaire's ambassador to Washington in 1986 -- Mobutu has come up with another surprise. This month he has managed to play host to both Nelson Mandela and the South African Navy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu received the African National Congress leader in the provincial city of Goma on September 8th, a day after a South African military spokesperson in Cape Town confirmed that three ships from the nearby Simonstown naval base were on an &quot;assistance operation&quot; with the Zaire navy. The mission, the statement said, was to help locate and remove sunken ships from the harbor of the Atlantic seacoast town of Banana.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joint operation was acknowledged after complaints from Angolan officials, who called in Zaire's ambassador to Luanda to demand an explanation for the South African presence just off Angola's coast. Angop, the Angolan news agency, said the South African ships had berthed at the Zairean port of Matadi, about 100 miles inland on the Zaire River on the Angolan-Zaire border. Matadi, Angop pointed out, is a major transshipment point for U.S. covert military assistance to the Angolan rebel movement Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria said the operation in Zaire is consistent with its policy of helping &quot;those African countries where diplomatic contacts have opened the way for further contact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson Mandela visited Zaire after attending a meeting of the Organization of African Unity in neighboring Uganda. On September 9th, the South African addressed a rally of about 10,000 people in Kinshasa, the Zaire capital, where he thanked Mobutu for having supported the &quot;release Mandela&quot; campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past year, Mobutu has tried to mute both domestic and international criticism by pledging sweeping reforms in Zaire's autocratic political system. Five months ago he announced a one-year transition from single party rule to a three-party democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month in New York, the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights released a 231-page report saying that despite the promised changes, Mobutu's security forces still &quot;have unrestrained authority to arrest, abuse and detain the population,&quot; that the government &quot;routinely carries out arbitrary arrest and detention without charge,&quot; and that &quot;physical abuse and mistreatment of prisoners are common.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makau wa Mutua and Peter Rosenblum, who co-authored the report after two fact-finding visits to Zaire, were attacked on their latest trip by what they believe were security forces. The Zairean government denies any role in the incident, but concedes that it closely monitored the men's work in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the incidents the report chronicles is the killings of an unknown number of students at the University of Lubumbashi in southeast Zaire by Mobutu's special forces in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa News has obtained eyewitness accounts of several of the killings in which students describe a night of terror. &quot;I saw the masked military men decapitate and cut into pieces the bodies so that they were unrecognizible,&quot; said a student who jumped out a window and hid in the woods.  &quot;What was left was put on a truck and thrown into a ditch. I saw with my own eyes at least 20 dead students.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another student says he hid under the bed of his next door neighbor and heard him being beaten to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furor over the killings caused Belgium to suspend aid to Zaire and French officials cancelled a scheduled meeting in the Zaire capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, Mobutu could count on his pro-Western policies to net him continued aid and support from Europe and the U.S., despite growing complaints about both his government's legendary corruption and its human rights record.  His critics hope that in the post-Cold War world, Mobutu's dictatorial policies may get closer scrutiny when aid monies are disbursed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And some former critics-turned-colleagues think they see the writing on the wall. Nguza Karl-I-Bond, who returned from Washington to be foreign minister, set up his own opposition party in May -- a move that brings him full circle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has begun what President Ibrahim Babangida calls the &quot;last lap&quot; before his military regime's promised handover of power to a democratically elected civilian administration in October of 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, for the first time since the military's seizure of power in 1983, officially sanctioned political parties are operating freely in the country. Following national conventions in August to select party leaders, the country's two approved parties are busily campaigning for December's local elections. Under a new constitution resembling the American federal model, the government has established two parties - the Social Democratic Party, slightly to the left, and the National Republican Party, to the right of center.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, President Babangida has reshuffled his administration in a move he says is intended to &quot;demilitarize the process of politics and governance.&quot; He has stressed that he is barred by the new constitution from candidacy in the 1992 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But having lived under military rule for 19 of Nigeria's 30 years as an independent country, some Nigerians remain skeptical that Babangida will keep to his handover pledge. There is speculation that he may instead try to re-emerge as a civilian head-of-state. &quot;General Ibrahim Babangida will hand over to Alhaji Ibrahim Babangida,&quot; says Yusuf Bela Usman, associate professor of history at Ahmadou Belo University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a grim reminder of continuing competition for control of Africa's most populous country, there was the jolting news on July 27th that 42 soldiers had been executed for their role in the latest coup attempt last April. The government announcement, made at 7:00 p.m. -- two hours after the men were sent to a firing squad -- followed a lengthy meeting of the Armed Forces Ruling Council, which reviewed the decisions handed down by a military tribunal. The announcement said 764 persons had been acquitted, 9 sentenced to prison, and 31 sent back for retrial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bloody April coup attempt and its aftermath seemed to shake the nation's confidence. Previous coups have been purely military affairs, but this time the government says there was significant civilian participation. The insurrection was allegedly financed by a businessman, Great Ogburu, who fled the country and is now on the government's wanted list along with several high-ranking military officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogburu went first to London, where, according to the Nigerian weekly magazine Newswatch, he penned a letter to the government saying he &quot;was hoodwinked into the plot&quot; by one of the coup leaders. Ogburu is now believed to be in hiding in Texas, Newswatch reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The April uprising was also the first in Nigeria where non-commissioned officers played a major role. Only nine of the 42 men executed were of officer rank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major Gideon Orka, the coup leader, went on the radio as the takeover began, saying he was acting &quot;on behalf of the middle belt and southern parts of this country&quot; -- a reflection of the resentment felt by many Nigerians about the perceived domination of the country's polity by the Muslim North. He also announced the expulsion of five states that are predominately Muslim from the Nigerian federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethnic divisions, combined with the religious differences, remain a potent force in Nigerian politics. Babangida stirred animosity in 1986 when he enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of Islamic Countries without clearing the action with the Armed Forces Ruling Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tensions were evident in the reactions to the cabinet and military reshuffle Babangida carried out last December. Defense Minister Lieutenant General Domkat Bali -- from Lantang in Plateau State in the &quot;middle belt&quot; -- and several other senior military figures were replaced with Muslim officers.  There were protests from Christian groups, but the government said the fact that the new appointees are Muslim was purely coincidental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Bali's removal generated so much dissatisfaction that Babangida decided to postpone a scheduled state visit to Washington in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was some evidence of a sympathetic reaction among non-Northerners to at least some aspects of the coup attempt. &quot;For the first time someone has touched on the real issues causing problems in this country,&quot; said university student Eunice Orie. But others reacted differently, seeing stability and the need for democracy as the priorities of the moment. General Bali, whose humiliating dismissal was one of Orka's stated reasons for attempting the coup, called the action &quot;childish and immature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Babangida's five years in office have been marked by a steady decline in the people's standard of living, the depletion of the middle class and the widening of the gulf between the extremely rich and the extremely poor,&quot; says Newswatch. Still, the magazine said, as a &quot;consummate wielder of power,&quot; Babangida has restored confidence and stability in the political system -- emerging in the process &quot;as the most powerful man Nigeria has ever known.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's latest move, just over two weeks ago, was a major shake-up of senior aides, a tactic that has become his modus operandi. The changes, announced after a meeting of the Armed Forces Ruling Council, included the appointment of nine new Cabinet ministers, the reassignment of four others, and the establishment -- for the first time in a Nigerian military regime -- of the post of vice president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Named to the new post is Augustus Aikhomu, a vice admiral who has been Babangida's top aide since October 1986 when he assumed the now abolished post of chief of general staff. Aikhomu is the highest ranking Christian in the predominately Muslim government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new post of chief of staff, to which Babangida named Major General Salihu Ibrahim, who had been commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, is intended to be purely military and non-political, in accordance with the new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babangida also turned to trusted aides for two other key positions.  Major General Ike Nwachukwu was reappointed foreign minister only eight months after leaving that job to command the 1st Mechanized Division of the Nigerian army. Nwachukwu, who was chairman of the military tribunal that tried the coup plotters, is a Christian who replaced Rilwanu Lukman, a Moslem whose ouster had been sought by some Christian critics of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji, an experienced negotiator on economic matters, was moved from budget and planning to the finance ministry, where he will have responsibility for dealing with the country's creditors. The appointments were followed by the resignation of all Cabinet ministers from their military positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babangida also named 10 new governors and appointed civilian deputy governors for all 21 Nigerian states. Two of the new deputies are women.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A decade ago, Esther Ocloo of Ghana and 14 other women founded an international financial institution to serve women entrepreneurs. This year, in an ongoing tenth anniversary celebration called &quot;Give Women Credit,&quot; Women's World Banking (WWB) is taking stock of its accomplishments. Among other things, WWB has created a network of over 90 local groups, extended 56,000 loans of which less than 1.5 per cent were not paid back, and established 25 new loan programs for women around the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 27th, that record will be highlighted when Esther Ocloo receives this year's Africa Prize for Leadership for the Sustainable End of Hunger, an annual award presented in New York City by the Hunger Project.  Ocloo's co-winner is General Olesegun Obasanjo, a former Nigerian ruler who has emerged as an elder statesman of Africa, campaigning for democracy and agricultural self-sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's World Banking President Michaela Walsh says the premise that women, even in the poorest communities, can manage their own financial affairs has been proven. The WWB system requires that local groups put up a quarter of the capital for a loan fund, with a cooperating bank providing another quarter and WWB itself providing the remaining half. Each contributor shares the risks proportionately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money has funded everything from a bicycle manufacturing business to an electronics firm called Solar Shamba that provides solar-powered rural electrification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esther Ocloo says that access to credit was the first essential step to improving the lives of poor women and their families. The next step, Ocloo hopes, is the establishment of community banks to act as the lending agencies.  When women have their own banks, she says, the interest that is now being paid to commercial banks &quot;becomes our profit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roots of Women's World Banking are in Ghana, where a 1974 meeting of women preparing for an upcoming United Nations Decade for Women conference decided that access to credit was women's most important need. The group included small-scale entrepreneurs such as local market women as well as leaders of women's organizations. Before education or health care or family planning, the group said, women needed money in their pockets. If they had the resources, they could make their own decisions and take care of their other necessities themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghanaian women, including Ocloo and former Supreme Court Justice Annie Jiagge, took their notion to the UN conference in Mexico City in 1975, where it found an eager acceptance. But it was five years before the formal launch of WWB at a meeting in Amsterdam. Esther Ocloo was elected to chair the first Board of Directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ocloo says that the women of Ghana, both as women and as people of a nation that had been colonized, must go through a period of painful change.  &quot;Our affairs were managed for us,&quot; she says. &quot;But now we are managing our own affairs, and like any other new thing, &cent;there are/ teething troubles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ocloo is convinced that independence and self-sufficiency are worth the suffering required to attain them, and that people who achieve some control over their own lives discover a tremendous new store of energy. &quot;All of a sudden,&quot; she says, &quot;ingenuity is being expressed in all places and at all levels. Everybody is trying to do something!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this year, consultant Anne Mize of Seattle, Washington was hired by the California-based development organization Tecnica to help a women's cooperative operate a shoe factory in the Botswana town of Kanye. Her experience raised many of the major questions being debated hotly among the development aid community, including the role of foreign experts, the relationship with local counterparts, and the ability of local communities to sustain projects they did not initiate. Here are excerpts from the journal Mize kept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I was sent here to do at first glance appears to be impossible.  This small shoemaking factory was owned and operated by a white male expatriate. He decided about a year ago to leave the country and sell the business. The women workers refused to leave their jobs, and initiated a worker takeover with the help of Corde, an organization that supports Botswana's cooperative movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, however, there have been a lot of problems. Without their &quot;boss&quot; and enemy no longer around, the women apparently are working less well together than before the enterprise became a cooperative. They have requested that Corde help them establish a collective management system and teach them business skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is needed is better communication and, in American terminology, &quot;team-building skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was hoping to have a month for this work. Because of travel restrictions and the time spent making housing arrangements, I'll only have two and a half weeks. Then the next volunteer comes from the U.S. to teach small business skills. The women will not be open to his training, I fear, unless a psychologically healthier atmosphere is created at the workplace. . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personally, my morale is also a bit low. I am presently in Gaborone &cent;the Botswana capital/, still waiting to meet with the Corde staff to discuss the project. Thus far they have been helpful but disorganized. This stems from what appears to be overcommitment to helping too many projects. Tomorrow I hope to go back to Kanye and begin interviewing each of the women, with the help of a translator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a positive note, I am immediately attracted to Botswana. The landscape bears some resemblance to the southwestern U.S. I grew up in Kansas.  Because of my love and need for open space, my heart sings when traveling through this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I look forward to getting to know the people better. Some of the folks at the cooperative training session are impressively intelligent and articulate. They do not want Botswana to go the capitalist route; they fear the materialism of South Africa. Learning to establish successful small businesses in the form of cooperatives is important to them. . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I finally started my job in earnest with the Malekwa cooperative.  Simon, the Corde staff member who will work with me, is a Tswana who has worked for several weeks with this group. He's been discouraged with the lack of progress in productivity and morale. As this was his first major assignment with Corde, I think he feels that my coming to work here is both a slap in his face and a relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We began with all the workers sitting around the table where they cut and glue shoe leather. Simon talked to them about my consulting and the purpose of the work and of the volunteers who will follow me. He made it clear that this is the last effort Corde will make to help the co-op improve its production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I explained that I wanted to begin by getting to know them each individually. They looked a little nervous; as it turned out, they were afraid that whatever they said would be used against them. As the interviews began, it was clear that I had to emphasize the confidentiality of our talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were some heart-rending stories. One woman is working to support the children of her daughter, a previous co-op member who had recently died.  Another has a child dying in a hospital nearly 100 kilometers away. Another is putting her children through school after her husband walked out. She is 44 -- my age -- and I had mistaken her for 60! The lives of these women are very harsh. The minimal wages they earn for their work barely keeps them alive.  Working with African women, I am so often brought to tears. . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So many whites from around the world are taking positions in the Botswana government. This contributes to my feelings of reservation about doing this job. The dependency this group has on outside help is already great, from marketing to raw materials to organizing. Strategies &cent;for improving production/ have not worked thus far, I think, because self-management is difficult for them to internalize. They have been managed for the majority of their working lives. In some ways, I'm coming in to manage them yet again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans must begin to solve their own problems. They must be allowed to have their own land back. My feeling on this trip, after many to southern Africa, is that I may not come back as a worker any longer, but as a visitor and friend. . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm spending time trying to adapt the procedures I've used for team building in the U.S. for this group. Translating everything means the whole process takes twice as long. And part of &quot;First World&quot; team training is bringing conflicts out into the open, followed by a process of resolution.  Simon tells me this may be too threatening for these women. It's a dilemma for me; a delicate line to walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can co-ops be a success in Botswana? Is self-management possible for the Malekwa co-op? Though the work we are doing seems to be encouraging the workers, the problems they are facing seem almost insurmountable. They have received no wages for four months. They have thousands of dollars in debts to pay. It may be many more months before their ledger shows a profit. How can they hold out?. . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a morning of role-playing conflicts and problems and differing ways to resolve them, we broke for lunch. But none of the women were eating.  They said they had no money for food as it was the end of the month. That's when it finally hit me -- the survival level at which they're operating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their faces haunt me at night: the dances we dance together, the songs we sing, the tremendous courage of the three crippled ladies, the laughter when I try to dance with them. . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My last day. Each of the women comes to meet me under the pine tree.  They ask me not to forget them. They say that what they've learned would affect all with whom they come in contact. They give me a pair of sandals they've made. They ask me to bring back 15 American husbands!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I leave in a flurry of songs and dances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen, listen, listen to my heart's song. I will never forget you, I will never forsake you,&quot; we chant to each other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like most residents of the Liberian capital, Monrovia, Bishop Arthur F. Kulah has spent the last two months trying to stay alive through the relentless fighting in the city's streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As leader of the United Methodist Church, Liberia's largest denomination, Kulah was a spokesman for church concerns about corruption and human rights abuses under the regime of President Samuel K. Doe, who was finally captured by rebels last week. In early July, when the Bishop's residence was ransacked by angry government troops, Kulah went into hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with about two dozen other people, the bishop took refuge in a house in the crowded suburb known as Congotown, where in recent weeks each man, woman and child has subsisted on a few spoonfuls of rice a day, cooked in a little oil. Congotown, like most of Monrovia, has been without electricity, water or telephone service for more than two months, and food is scarce everywhere. Cholera has been reported in scattered parts of the city, and last week the disease appeared to be spreading in an area jammed with 2,000 refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the death toll from the fighting and from starvation is in the thousands and a quarter of Liberia's 2.3 million people have fled the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them is J. Lamark Cox, Sr., a businessman and church lay leader who calls himself one of the lucky few. When fighting forced him from his central Monrovia home on July 17th, he found shelter in the same Congotown house as Bishop Kulah. &quot;We were fortunate,&quot; Cox says, &quot;that the household had its small store of rice. Thousands and thousands of Liberians cannot get anything to eat now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men had planned to stay in Monrovia to try to maintain a church presence among the desperate population, Cox says. But after the latest peace talks broke down at the end of August, they decided to try to leave the country to seek outside help. Making their way overland to neighboring Cote d'Ivoire, they caught a plane to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where there are large concentrations of Liberian refugees. Bishop Kulah remained in West Africa to focus on getting relief supplies to refugees and into Liberia. Cox continued to the United States, where his wife and children awaited him, to try to stir public concern about the Liberian plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since rebel forces led by Charles Taylor entered Liberia last Christmas, Cox says, government forces have been responsible for most of &quot;the human massacre of large numbers of our people.&quot; Doe's forces targeted members of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups whose home area is in the northeast where the rebellion began. As Taylor's forces and a breakaway group led by Prince Johnson gathered support and advanced on the capital, members of Doe's ethnic group, the Krahn, and the closely allied Mandingo group began to be victims of reprisals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has &quot;never in our history&quot; experienced the sort of ethnic-based strife that has now spread throughout the country, Cox says. &quot;We never expected it to take place, but it is now something we have to be resolute enough to repair.&quot; Cox says Liberia's religious communities, whose members span the various ethnic groups, can play the most important role in reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, though, the focus is on ending the fighting and getting food, clothing and medicine to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early last month, a seven-nation mediation committee convened by Ecowas -- the Economic Community of West African States -- hammered out a framework for a cease-fire and sponsored a meeting of Liberian exiles called the Liberian National Conference. The conference selected an interim government, headed by political scientist Amos Sawyer, to rule until elections can be held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 23, after the last round of peace talks failed to get off the ground, Ecowas sent a ground and naval force into the besieged nation to try to impose a cease-fire. Ecowas officials said the West African Community was forced to act after the United States, traditionally Liberia's closest ally, rejected repeated appeals for its intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Ecowas Executive Secretary Abbas Bundu said that Prince Johnson has promised to cooperate with the Sawyer government, despite the fact that Johnson had declared himself Liberia's president after capturing Doe.  Bundu said that the commander of Doe's forces at the executive mansion in Monrovia has also agreed to cooperate with the interim government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Doe's reported death while in Johnson's custody, the immediate problem facing the Ecowas troops was how to contain Taylor's forces, who after eight months of fighting, feel they have won the war and don't want to lose it at the peace table. A complicating factor is that Taylor has the support of Ecowas member Burkina Faso, whose government is believed to have supplied Taylor with new weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Liberians are making urgent appeals for humanitarian assistance. On September 8th, a four-person U.S. government disaster and relief team arrived in Monrovia to assess the situation. But little can be done by anyone until the fighting ends.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Military buildup in the world continues to be the main obstacle to overcoming hunger, according to the Washington, DC-based Bread for the World Institute on Hunger and Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the arms race in developed countries may have cooled, it is accelerating rapidly in developing countries, whose share of the world arms market increased from 7 to 19 percent between 1960 and 1987, says a report issued by the group on October 16th to coincide with World Food Day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military conflicts inevitably disrupt food production and distribution, lead to environmental degradation, create refugees and therefore cause extensive hunger, the Hunger 1990 study states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Horn of Africa, the report also says, arms supplied by the United States and Soviet Union feed greater militarization where famine, declining per capita food production, debt and collapsing social services are already overwhelming problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report points up five other major causes of world hunger which can, it says, be addressed effectively by support for food relief agencies and by lobbying for change in government policy. These include overlooking the needs and skills of women in development projects, environmental destruction linked to rapid population growth, emphasis on economic growth without attention to human resource development, exclusion of the poor from projects designed to benefit them, and donor country policies on development aid that can actually undermine any benefits for the developing country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite a Mali government blackout on news coverage of the conflict, a rebellion by Touareg nomads appears to be continuing. Peace talks October 10-12 in Algeria failed to find a solution to the conflict, Reuters reports from Bamako, the Mali capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels say they are fighting for the right &quot;to work, to be educated, to participate in economic and political debate and the right to live.&quot; The government of President Moussa Traore identifies its opponents as tools of Libya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current troubles broke out late last June with an attack by well-armed Touareg on a police station in Menaka in the northern Malian desert, followed by raids on other military and administrative targets. The government has declared a state of emergency in the Gao and Timbuktu regions, resulting in what the human rights group Amnesty International says have been over 50 public executions of suspected rebels. In addition, more than a hundred civilians have been reported killed, including dozens of men, women and children in a nomad encampment, while a similar number of deaths are estimated on the government side. Among the numerous people under detention or house arrest, Amnesty says, is Sikaye ag Ekawel, director of a government-sponsored food aid project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French Secretary of State for Humanitarian Action, Bernard Kouchner, who visited northern Mali as well as neighboring Niger to assess the situation, calls the conflict &quot;extremely dangerous.&quot; The traditional hostility between the region's governments and the nomads who roam across national boundaries could easily be kindled into massive retribution against the Touareg, Kouchner warns. Last month, the European Parliament passed a resolution saying that if the fighting continues, &quot;an entire people will be threatened with annihilation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Touareg are a fiercely independent people sometimes called the &quot;blue men,&quot; because the indigo dye on the veils worn by Touareg men rubs off on the skin. The rebels call themselves the Movement for the Liberation of Mali (MLM). A recently-released MLM document calls on all Malians who are victims of &quot;injustice and poverty&quot; to join the effort to replace Traore's &quot;dictatorial military regime&quot; with a democratic system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a Touareg-inspired uprising may be improbable, due to ancient animosities between the nomads and the settled peoples of the region, recent years have seen growing sympathy among the various groups in desert societies, all of them hard pressed by drought as well as by the economic crises in their countries. And the call for democracy is becoming increasingly prevalent.  President Traore, visiting Washington, D.C. this month, reiterated an August promise to consider political pluralism. He may be forced to think fast. Last week an estimated 100 demonstrators marched through the Malian capital, Bamako demanding multi-party democracy. It was the first public protest against Traore in his 22-year rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">417 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robert Rodale served as a member of the Board of Directors of Africa News Service from 1988 until he was killed in a car accident in the Soviet Union on September 20, 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being on our board wasn't something he had time to do. But he did it anyway, because he cared about Africa and he knew that his skills and experience could help us build an effective, financially stable news agency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As head of Rodale Press, begun by his father in the 1940s, Robert Rodale supervised an empire that publishes the magazines Prevention, Organic Gardening, Bicycling and several others, as well as half a dozen newsletters and 35 to 40 books a year. The company also operates three book clubs. Other Rodale enterprises include an agricultural research facility and a non-profit organization, the Rodale Institute, devoted to &quot;making agriculture more profitable and biologically sound.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of his death, Rodale was in Moscow to launch a Russian-language edition of the magazine The New Farmer, which encourages &quot;sustainable agriculture&quot; and a reduced reliance on chemicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was his soft-spoken humor combined with passion that set Robert Rodale apart from many crusaders. Indeed, his mild-mannered, almost diffident demeanor made him an unlikely titan of publishing, but he was a marketing genius as well as a visionary -- and he told stories with a wry wit that continued to evoke smiles long after the recounting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We first met Robert Rodale in 1984, while reporting on his company's role in a resource-efficient farming project in Tanzania. &quot;Never underestimate the power of a book,&quot; he told us, relating a tale first told by then-U.S.  Ambassador to Tanzania David Miller. The project started, it seems, with Ambassador Miller's wife Mollie, whose copy of The Rodale Book of Composting found its way to Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before long, a Rodale team was in Tanzania working with agricultural extension officers to revive organic farming techniques that were once common in Africa, but were abandoned after colonialism brought chemical-intensive farming to the continent. &quot;In the Third World you have a shortage of food,&quot; Rodale said. &quot;In the U.S. we have an overabundance. In both places the waste of nutrients is the same. So the idea of resource efficiency is of universal application.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Rodale's conviction that everyone can make a difference was contagious. Like many others, we will miss his enthusiasm, his encouragement and his inspiration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the breakdown of talks between the government of Mozambique and the rebel movement Renamo, the ruling Frelimo party is going ahead with plans for multi-party elections under a new constitution. Since August, a constitutional commission has been discussing proposals for the changeover from a one-party system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While procedures for the elections, expected to take place next July, are being developed, there is also a vigorous debate on a range of social and economic policies. There are strongly divergent views, within Frelimo as well as outside it, on how far the move towards a free-market system should go and on how to address the growing economic inequalities of recent years. But all the plans and discussions are overshadowed by the dominant issue of peace.  There is general agreement that solutions to any of Mozambique's problems depend on ending the conflict that has claimed an estimated 900,000 lives, due both to direct casualties and to war-induced famine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high-level Mozambican government delegation first met Renamo representatives for direct talks in July, followed by a second session in August, both held in Rome. Renamo boycotted a scheduled third meeting in September, and prospects for a renewed round of talks remain uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambique agreed to the direct negotiations early this year after South African President F.W. de Klerk pledged that his government was no longer backing Renamo. But talks were delayed for months in a dispute over location.  When the sessions finally got underway -- led by a top Frelimo leader, Transport Minister Armando Guebuza and Raul Domingos, head of Renamo's Department of External Relations -- they were inconclusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989, Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano had asked Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbab-we to mediate the conflict and pave the way for negotiations. At the second Rome session, according to reporting by Karl Maier for the London newspaper, the Independent, the Renamo delegation refused to discuss substantive issues, demanding instead that Kenya again be invited to mediate. Kenya's permanent secretary for foreign affairs Bethuel Kiplagat reportedly lobbied to transfer the talks to Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mozambique delegation regarded the quest for new Kenyan involvement as a delaying tactic and remains suspicious of the role of Kiplagat, whom Mozambique sees as a Renamo partisan. On August 11th, the Mozambique Information Agency reported that Kenya is now involved in military training of Renamo troops. The agency said a Kenyan-trained battalion infiltrated Tete province through neighboring Malawi and that Mozambican forces had captured an air shipment of ammunition from Kenya in Manica province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mozambican army, aided by troops from Zim-babwe, appears to have made headway against Renamo in recent months in areas such as the densely populated Zambezia province, as well as in Renamo's traditional base area south of the Zambezi River. Renamo cited the government advances as a reason for withdrawing from the peace talks in September. Mozambique's President Chissano responded that the military operations were normal defensive measures within the country that could stop only with a mutuallyagreed cease-fire -- the objective, he said, of the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambique officials say that despite battlefield successes for the government, there is no hope of a military resolution to the conflict, since making the entire country secure from continuing guerrilla attacks is infeasible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the political front, however, the government is pressing forward, leaving little apparent room for new Renamo demands. The group has an open invitation to end the war and register as a political party to contest next year's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mozambique's formal announcement of the shift to a multi-party system made international headlines in July and August, the change was prefigured by release of a draft constitution in January. Under its provisions, presidential candidates must be proposed by 5,000 voters, of whom there must be at least 200 in each province -- an attempt to prevent new parties from encouraging ethnic or regional divisions. The draft also limits a president's tenure to two five-year terms and makes no mention of a Frelimo role in either assembly or presidential elections. The proposals were widely debated in public meetings across the country from April through June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summarizing the debate as it related to multiple parties, Chissano said that a majority of the Mozambicans participating, particularly in rural areas, had favored continuation of the one-party system. But the president said that because a substantial minority had argued for political pluralism, it would not be right to block those who wish to do so from forming other parties. A new electoral law is expected to lay down procedures through which new parties may be registered, and will likely incorporate provisions similar to those for presidential candidates, requiring geographical distribution among a potential party's supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano himself, though he seems to enjoy strong personal popularity, told a Tanzanian journalist in late August that he has &quot;no reason to remain in power if the people of Mozambique do not want me.&quot; And Frelimo officials acknowledge that their party suffers the disadvantages of incumbency during years of war and economic crisis. But Renamo, with its reputation for brutality against civilians, seems an unlikely heir to the mantle of &quot;people's power&quot; with which Frelimo began its rule at independence in 1975. It remains to be seen whether other forces will emerge to take advantage at the ballot box of the widespread war-weariness and disillusionment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beefed up by some 5,000 additional Nigerian soldiers, the West African peacekeeping force in Liberia is slowly gaining control over the battle-torn Liberian capital Monrovia. The force has been increased in size this month from 4,500 to more than 9,000 and has been reorganized under the command of Major General Joshua Dogonyaro, a member of Nigeria's ruling military council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five members of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) contributed troops to the force with the intent of imposing a cease fire on the three warring Liberian factions -- the Liberian army, the main rebel movement led by Charles Taylor, and a breakaway group led by Prince Johnson. The Ecowas Monitoring Group, called Ecomog, includes soldiers from Ghana, Nigeria, Sierre Leone, Guinea and the Gambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wanted the outfit to create an atmosphere which would allow an interim government to operate,&quot; said Nigerian Vice President Augustus Aikhomu in an interview in New York late last month. &quot;Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor refused to cooperate with the Ecowas effort, which he regards as a maneuver to keep him from seizing power.  His National Patriotic Front is believed to control most of the country outside the capital.  Last month, Ecowas was embarrassed when Liberian President Samuel K. Doe was captured at Ecomog headquarters, where he apparently went to negotiate his departure from the country. Following a shoot-out between Doe loyalists and Johnson's forces which left 60 dead, Doe was taken to Johnson's camp, tortured and killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following that incident and with fighting in Monrovia continuing, the Nigerians decided to increase their presence. As the largest country in the region, Nigeria was unwilling &quot;to stand idly by and allow such wanton killing to take place,&quot; Aikhomu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, Nigeria's participation in Ecomog was limited, in an attempt to ease Taylor's suspicions that the force was a Nigerian-inspired effort to rescue Doe's regime, with which the Nigerian military government had had relatively good relations in recent years. Ghanaian General Arnold Quainoo was named to lead Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quainoo remains in command, Aikhomu said -- in charge of the joint military force, under Nigeria's Dogonyaro, who has overall authority over the Ecowas presence in Liberia. A civilian component of Ecomog is being created this month to coordinate relief and refugee operations, the Nigerian vice president said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Ecomog established control over central Monrovia and began moving into the suburbs, according to reports from Reuters and United Press International (UPI) correspondents on the scene. Taylor's forces were reportedly forced to pull back. Johnson agreed to withdraw from the city center earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ecowas members have been divided over the Liberian intervention, and the differences have deepened since Doe's death. At the urging of Taylor, the government of Cote D'Ivoire tried to convene an Ecowas summit on October 15th.  But the effort failed when several key leaders refused to attend including Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara, the current Ecowas chaiman. Jawara has now announced plans for a summit on October 29th. Cote D'ivoire and Burkina Faso are backing Taylor, and most other French-speaking states in the region have withheld support for Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigadier General David Nimley, leader of the remaining Doe loyalists, has rejected Ecomog demands to surrender. &quot;We have nowhere else to go,&quot; he told UPI. &quot;This republic of Liberia is ours.&quot; He said he would remain in the executive mansion until an interim government arrives to take control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, Liberia's major political parties and religious organizations established an interim administration, led by Amos Sawyer, a political scientist and former university dean. But Sawyer's team has been forced by the fighting to remain outside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since taking control of the city, Ecomog has uncovered gruesome evidence of the results of months of fighting. The Reuters and UPI reporters have been taken to view two sites where hundreds of bodies have been left to rot. &quot;Half-clothed, decomposed heaps of flesh&quot; remain strewn across the pews, floors and balcony of St. Peter's Lutheran Church in downtown Monrovia, scene of a July 29 massacre by Doe's troops of 600 men, women and children who had taken refuge there from the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of a runway at Spriggs-Payne airfield, hundreds of skulls and bones were found where they were left by government soldiers after looting and killing sprees in the city, eyewitnesses told the reporters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Civil war in the east African nation of Rwanda, which could prove as intractable as many of the other disturbances around the continent, also threatens to rekindle animosities that have resulted in killing on a mammoth scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When communal violence gets started in this part of the world, it can lead to massacres in humongous numbers,&quot; says Roger Winter, executive director of the U.S. Committee for Refugees who is just back from a visit to the area.  In the last thirty years, fighting, primarily between the region's Tutsi and Hutu groups, has claimed tens of thousands of lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For most of their history, the people of Rwanda have lived together in relative tranquility,&quot; says University of North Carolina political scientist Catherine Newbury, author of a study of Rwanda from 1860 to 1960. &quot;The Tutsi and Hutu share a common language and culture and can in no way be described as tribes,&quot; she says. But the two groups are distinguished by differences, including the Tutsi tradition of governance by a system of royal chieftaincies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tutsi have historically held a dominant position over their more numerous neighbors. The German and Belgian colonizers concentrated power and wealth in Tutsi hands and introduced a segregated education system that blocked Hutu mobility and advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rwanda, the Hutu -- comprising 85% of the population -- rose up against Tutsi supremacy in 1959, and most of the Tutsi chiefs fled the country. After independence in 1962, an effort by the exiles to return to power was suppressed by the Hutu-run government, resulting in widespread killing of Tutsi. (In next-door Burundi, where the ethnic composition is similar, the governing Tutsi slaughtered an estimated 60,000 Hutu during the most recent outbreak of killing in 1988.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The longstanding tensions are exacerbated by the modern competition for resources. Rwanda has one of the fastest growing populations in the world -- 3.8 percent per year. And it is densely populated -- seven million people occupying 10,169 square miles, or nearly 690 people per square mile. It's as if Nebraska, with a farming population like Rwanda's but ten times the land area, had 70 million inhabitants instead of 845,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana says the current conflict is a Tutsi effort to regain power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting broke out at the beginning of October with an invasion from neighboring Uganda by a force of Ugandan army soldiers of Rwandan descent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the insurgents appear to be mostly Tutsi, a six-page political program issued in the name of the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) says the opposition to Habyarimana comes from all sectors of the populace. Rwandans have &quot;outgrown the ill-motivated divisive politics of the last three decades&quot; and have learned to live harmoniously &quot;like the Flemish and Walloons&quot; of Belgium, the document says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels accuse Habyarimana of undemocratic and corrupt practices and say his regime reserves most educational and vocational opportunities for a small clique from the north, the president's home region. This has alienated not only the minority Tutsi -- 14% of the population -- and the Twa, with one percent, but also Hutu from the south as well as a section of the northern Hutu, the rebels say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rwanda is the only country outside South Africa that issues a passbook indicating the bearer's ethnicity,&quot; the RPF document says. &quot;This segregative, apartheid-like policy serves only to deter the progress and development of Rwanda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an eight-point program, the front promises the abolition of sectarianism and corruption, &quot;free and fair elections,&quot; and the &quot;unconditional&quot; repatriation of Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the refugee problem that sparked the uprising. Habyarimana has contended that his country cannot absorb all the Rwandans in Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire -- estimated to total between one and two million -- and has asked these countries to accept the exiles as immigrants. Uganda, where most of them are living, has refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, negotiations between Uganda and Rwanda led to an agreement that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees would survey the Rwandan exiles to determine whether they want to return home or remain where they are.  According to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, the accord represented &quot;a positive step,&quot; since it included Habyarimana's first acknowledgement of responsibility for the problem. &quot;That's why I am upset by this action,&quot; Museveni said of the invasion, in an interview during a visit to Washington earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the RPF invasion force is Fred Rwigyema, a former deputy commander of the Ugandan National Resistance Army (NRA), which fought its way to power in a decade-long campaign against Idi Amin and several successive governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winter, who has known Rwigyema for several years and met with him recently in Uganda, says he sympathizes with the refugees' plight. &quot;But when you consider the risk of massive violence, I have a hard time understanding why these guys went in,&quot; he says. The reprisals that followed the attempted Tutsi takeover attempt in 1963 offer a worrisome precedent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of the history of conflict, Newbury believes that a bloodbath is not inevitable. Habyarimana has succeeded in reducing ethnic tensions, which were very high when he took power in a 1973 coup, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well-trained and battle-seasoned, the rebel troops quickly seized several towns in the north and reportedly captured a large stockpile of weapons. With an initial force of about 10,000, the invaders have grown to a reported 20,000 or more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to their strength is a smaller contingent of refugee fighters from Tanzania, led by Colonel Alex Kanyarengwe, who -- like many of his soldiers -- is a Hutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Habyarimana quickly appealed for outside help. Belgium and France sent troops, as did President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Rwanda's huge western neighbor. With these reinforcements, Rwanda's 4,000-man army was able to recapture the strategic garrison town of Gabiro, 40 miles northeast of the capital. Hundreds of suspected Patriotic Front sympathizers were rounded up in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, though, the government suffered military reversals. Gabiro was retaken by Rwigyema's forces, and Zaire abruptly withdrew its forces, officially numbered at 500. With no combat experience and only limited outside backing, government troops may have difficulty containing rebel advances from both the north and south of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced by the prospect of protracted conflict, Habyarimana turned to diplomacy to shore up his position. He appealed for United Nations action, met with Museveni in Tanzania, and flew to Europe for consultations with the French and Belgians. The Rwandan, Ugandan and Tanzanian presidents jointly called for a cease-fire and negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think this is going to be over quickly,&quot; Winter says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Educated and articulate, Museveni at 46 years of age personifies the new generation of African leaders and potential leaders who are struggling to surmount both the economic and political dislocations of the colonial period and what they regard as the misguided policies of post-colonial African governments. In July, Museveni was elected chairman of the Organization of African Unity -- a position that rotates among the heads of state of the 51-member organization. A former guerrilla leader, Museveni came to power in 1986, after a long military campaign -- first to overthrow the regime of Idi Amin and then to win power from a succession of weak or authoritarian governments that followed Amin's ouster.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They beg for loans from outside and fail to see the huge opportunities inside our country,&quot; he said of his planning ministry and other economic decision makers, during an interview in Washington earlier this month. &quot;Uganda is one of the richest countries in the whole world.&quot; It has abundant natural resources and a geographical location on the equator, &quot;which means we can produce all the year round,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the country still is dependent on one crop, coffee, for over 90% of its export earnings. The situation has worsened since independence in 1962, when coffee accounted for about half the foreign exchange revenues, the Ugandan leader says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museveni is committed to an integrated approach to economic growth and is promoting the processing of raw materials, such as sugar, which previously was exported unprocessed. There is also a concerted effort to establish light industries, including textiles and cement manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda is actively courting foreign investors. As long as an investment will save foreign exchange or earn foreign exchange, it will be welcomed, the president says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's top priority is education, something it has been able to do little about since coming to power. &quot;The tax base was very narrow, and there was no way initially we could have tackled education in a comprehensive way,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing another issue that is growing in importance across the continent, Museveni says that Africa's governments must become &quot;accountable&quot; to their citizens. &quot;There must be free access to competition for political power,&quot; he says, although Western forms of democracy may not be appropriate in Africa's &quot;pre-industrial societies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many of his counterparts, Museveni is doubtful that introducing multiple parties would lead to real democratic reforms. Politics in Africa, he says, has revolved around competition for access to power -- &quot;for handouts from the state, for civil service appointments,&quot; using sectarian appeals -- ethnic or religious. These appeals succeed in agrarian states, Museveni argues, because people do not have a well-developed national identity.  The challenge in Africa is ensuring democracy while avoiding sectarianism, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Uganda, political allegiances have paralleled religious affiliations. Museveni says he is trying to replace the established order with a new arrangement that unites the country. Although he has not banned the old parties, he has suspended their activities and seems intent on destroying them. His own power base is the National Resistance Army, now consisting of an estimated 75,000 soldiers, and its political wing, the National Resistance Movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movement, he says, incorporates many ideologies and provides access to political decisionmaking to all &quot;within a united framework.&quot; He argues that the steps taken to create &quot;mass nonpartisan democracy&quot; will prevent the emergence of another Idi Amin-style dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museveni has not faced an election since assuming power nearly five years ago. His term was recently extended to 1995, when he plans national elections for Parliament and the presidency. He has not said whether more than one candidate will be allowed to compete for the highest office. Museveni says he himself would be willing to step down if he fails to win re-election.  &quot;Actually I'm looking forward to the rest,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president expects to see the eventual emergence in Uganda of political parties representing different interests -- not ethnic or other sectarian groups -- &quot;but it hasn't happened yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should pro-democracy forces in countries ruled by dictators take up arms, as Ugandans did, Museveni was asked. &quot;Certainly, if they are not just opportunists looking for a job,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Uganda leader is critical of the rebels who have launched an invasion of neighboring Rwanda from Ugandan territory. &quot;They didn't listen to advice from their friends,&quot; Museveni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A solution to the problem will come only when Rwanda agrees to restore the rights of the refugees to return home, Museveni insisted. &quot;They should be free to live there, to vote and be voted for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The taped interview on which this article is based was conducted by Rob Wright, senior editor for the weekly newsletter World Bank Watch.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two-thirds of the world's &quot;least developed countries&quot; are in Africa, according to the latest list prepared by the United Nations. Known collectively as LDCs, the &quot;least developed&quot; nations are those low-income countries that are thought to be most vulnerable to continuing economic crises for a variety of structural reasons. Although the African LDCs' per capita GDP (gross domestic product) of $ 237 a year is just above the overall LDC average of $227, African countries fare the worst on most indicators. Life expectancy in the African LDCs is 47 years, three years less than the total LDC average. The infant mortality rate is 121 per 1,000 live births for the African LDCs, compared to 106 for other LDCs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gap between the poorest Africans and the citizens of industrialized nations is illustrated graphically by two countries that sandwich the African continent -- Mali, in the northwest, where 168 babies die for every 1,000 born, and Mozambique, in the southeast, whose death rate per thousand is 172. In contrast, the rate for Japan is five, for Sweden is six, for Hong Kong is eight, for Singapore is nine and for the United States is 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A risk factor shared by African LDCs is their extreme dependence on a limited number of export commodities, at a time when commodity prices are continuing to decline on the world market. In 1987, 23 African LDCs depended on just three exports for an average 79 percent of their total earnings. That's a worsening of dependency since 1980, when the top three crops accounted for 76.9 percent of earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally troubling is the fact that between 1980 and 1988, the terms of trade of 19 African LDCs declined by 11 percent. Terms of trade represent the difference between the earnings from what countries sell and the cost of what they must buy. This year, the higher oil prices sparked by the Persian Gulf crisis will dramatically worsen the terms of trade for Africa, with the possible exception of the oil-producing countries -- Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Gabon, Libya and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month in Paris, the UN convened the Second Conference on Least Developed Countries -- a successor to the first conference on the topic, held in 1981. In an opening address, French President Francois Mitterrand pledged to boost France's development aid to 0.2 percent of his country's GDP, up from 0.14 percent in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some countries, including the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Libya already exceed the 0.2 percent mark -- and Norway more than doubles that amount at 0.42 percent -- but most wealthy countries fall short of the United Nations target for donors of 0.15 percent of their respective GDPs. In 1988, Japanese development assistance was 0.07 percent, while U.S. aid amounted to just 0.04 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Paris conference stressed the inevitability of continued decline in LDC living standards unless there is substantially increased help from donors. At the same time, a growing chorus of voices in poorer countries is saying that, without internal reforms -- including democratization -- more aid will mean little. So the economic crisis of the eighties may prove an added impetus to political revolutions of the nineties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neil Henry, East Africa correspondent for the Washington Post, reflected on this month's World Summit for Children in an article for Outlook, the paper's Sunday opinion section. It is reprinted here with the Post's permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - Of all the Liberian war refugees who had crammed into St.  Peter's Lutheran Church in Monrovia, few appeared less fearful than a little girl named Patience Nya. She seemed a picture of calm in a sea of human terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patience was about 7 years old, a skinny child in a worn red dress who interrupted an interview I was conducting with her mother to ask if I knew Michael Jackson, the American pop star who remains something close to a deity in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the stifling heat and noise on that June day at St. Peter's, where more than 3,000 civilians had sought safety from the marauding thugs of the Liberian army, the girl's guileless question provided a moment of welcome relief and a much-needed perspective on a savage civil conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nation where human life seemed to be losing value with each passing day, the children were a vivid reminder that the lives of Liberians need not be fraught with such pervasive evil, anarchy and war. As terrified adults beseeched foreign strangers for help, Patience -- and indeed many other refugee children at the church -- were going on with their lives as if little had changed, playing pickup games of tag and soccer in the crowded St. Peter's compound. Clearly, they were simply too young to understand the depth or meaning of their parents' fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I told Patience that, no, I didn't know Michael Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undeterred, she breathlessly named a few of her favorite songs as she skipped after me with several giggling friends during my rounds of interviews with other refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One night a few weeks later, a squad of men thought to be Liberian soldiers broke into the church. Armed with machetes, knives, cutlasses and M-16 rifles, they shot and butchered more than 600 refugees in an orgy of violence. The killers left bodies scattered throughout the church, many of them slumped over walls and window sills. Among the dead were a number of young mothers with babies still strapped to their backs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this day, I don't know if Patience, her mother Lydia Nya or her friends survived the horror of that July night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I do know that no matter who wins this sickening war, which has killed thousands of innocents and produced an estimated half million refugees so far, Liberia likely will need a very long time to recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, it's difficult to imagine the process of recovery even starting until the nation's deeply tormented and traumatized civilians feel reasonably secure under new and more humane leaders and no longer need to fear their own countrymen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 80 heads of state, including President Bush, recently gathered at the United Nations to discuss issues indirectly related to the suffering in Monrovia. The two-day conference, organized by the United Nations Children's Fund, was to focus on &quot;universal problems affecting the world's children,&quot; including war, malnutrition, education, drugs, homelessness and the impact of such evils as AIDS, child labor and child exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference came at a time when nearly 40 countries, including a dozen in Africa, have ratified a treaty recognizing children's human rights, the first of its kind in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, the Unicef summit could not be timelier -- particularly for sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest and least-developed region on earth. The world's children continue to die by the millions each year of malnutrition and preventable or treatable diseases and illnesses such as measles and diarrhea.  These problems are especially severe in Africa, where the crisis is exacerbated by heavy debt burdens and by foreign lenders' demands for sharp government cutbacks in spending on health, education and other social programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statistics are depressing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa suffers from more civil conflicts than any other region in the world and holds by far the most refugees -- 30 million and growing. More than 45% of African children never gain access to formal education. Africa's infant mortality is the world's worst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the African babies who do survive, the future is not promising: Africa's average annual economic growth rate of 1.4 percent between 1970 and 1985 was barely half the annual rise in population, a shortfall that continues virtually unabated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such problems certainly merit the attention of world leaders.  Thoughtlessness, incompetence and willful brutality were not listed as agenda items at the World Summit, but these human failings -- regularly exhibited by many of Africa's leaders -- certainly play profound roles in damaging the lives of millions of children and their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the 19 African heads of state who attended or promised to come to the New York conference are a couple of the continent's more notable dictators, whose political decisions have caused extreme divisiveness and arguably as much suffering in their countries as any disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Omar el Bashir, president of Sudan, was one. More than a year after seizing power in a military coup, the repressive Sudanese ruler is leading a charge to create a fundamentalist Islamic state in his multi-religious East African nation, thus increasing tensions and inflaming ethnic rivalries in Sudan's five-year-old civil war between the northern government and southern rebels. The human rights group Africa Watch estimates that 500,000 civilian Sudanese have died of starvation, warfare and tribal killings since 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed Siad Barre, the ailing, octogenarian leader of Somalia, had planned to attend the summit but did not. Among the more notorious decisions of his 20-year rule was a 1988 order for his air force to bomb the northern Somali city of Hargeisa, heartland of the opposition Isaak clan. The widespread bombing of houses, schools and markets destroyed the once-prosperous city and killed thousands of civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a reign of terror by the Somali army, hundreds of suspected rebel sympathizers were executed. With no end in sight, the war has claimed 60,000 civilian lives and spawned 500,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, it was not measles, malnutrition or poverty that caused the suffering and deaths of an unknown number of civilian men, women and children in the little town of Ghinda in the rebellious northern Ethiopian region of Eritrea earlier this year. Last year at this time, Ghinda was home to 20,000 Eritreans who lived in makeshift mud huts and tents at a camp for refugees displaced by the 30-year civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last fall, children by the hundreds swarmed and cheered a group of UN workers and foreign reporters who visited the camp. But in February, yet another round of mass killing broke out between the rebels and government forces, and thousands of additional lives have been lost. The main front between the two armies -- and the focus of great destruction -- was Ghinda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the leaders of some of Africa's poorest nations -- Benin, the Central African Republic, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Mali, Rwanda, and Uganda attended the New York summit, no one was listed to speak on behalf of the children who died at Ghinda or the ones who once played in the compound at St. Peter's church in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soviets at the conference didn't point to the $ 1 billion worth of arms Moscow bestowed on the harsh regime of Ethiopia's Mengistu Haile Mariam during the last decade, just as President Bush couldn't be expected to dwell on the $ 1 billion in military aid that Washington provided the irresponsible governments of Somalia, Sudan and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To fully assess the grim results of gun-peddling and foreign competition on the continent, one need not look farther than Angola and Mozambique, where millions of children remain displaced, crippled and orphaned after years of civil war, aided and abetted by Americans, Soviets, Cubans and South Africans. Finally, it was highly doubtful that the leaders at the Unicef summit would have cared to address the extent to which half-witted economic policies and official corruption in Africa retard human development. Certainly, many thousands of oral-rehydration kits to treat diarrhea could be bought for the hundreds of millions of dollars in emeralds, diamonds and other rare minerals annually smuggled -- often with official sanction -- out of Zambia, Zaire and Sierra Leone and sold on world markets, off the books, with precious little material benefit to the people of those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One also wonders how much more corn and grain could have been grown for the children of Ethiopia and Tanzania if their leaders hadn't pursued reckless agricultural policies and traumatic peasant relocation schemes that provided no incentives to farmers and inexorably led to a sharp decline in farm production throughout the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some ways, the silence about these issues at the New York summit may resound louder than all the speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One world leader who had been expected to attend the summit was Samuel K. Doe, the president of Liberia who was mortally wounded by rebel troops during a frenzy of killing in Monrovia last month. It was Doe's 10-year reign of corruption, his ruthless murders of opponents and his politics of tribal divisiveness that eventually led to the whirlwind the children of his country are now reaping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His absence in New York -- indeed, the absence of any shred of government in Liberia -- should represent a timely lesson of moral failure for many of Africa's leaders, those who attended the summit as well as those who stayed at home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the last decade of the century gets underway, Africa's prospects for the year 2000 appear bleak. But amid the gloomy projections of increased famine, disease and conflict, new voices are pressing the continent's leaders -- and their foreign funders -- towards political and economic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want our governments to re-prioritize -- to spendmore for the social programs that benefit children and less on wars and weapons,&quot; said Loatile Seleka, a 20-year old youth leader from Botswana, speaking at the World Summit for Children, held at the United Nations on September 29th and 30th in New York. &quot;We intend to pressurize them in every way we can.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But African governments face international pressures that compete with the demands of their citizens for increased expenditures on schools, health care and other services to improve living standards. The demand from foreign aid donors is for budget cuts and austerity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20% decline in average income during the 1980s has eroded living standards in many parts of the continent to levels that existed when most of the countries became independent in the 1960s. Part of the debate now taking place is whether the economic reforms being implemented in over 30 countries under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can reverse the downward trend and nudge the continent onto the path of growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 1990s will either see Africa further marginalized from the global economy, sliding further down the development scales, or the new decade will see Africa slowly reviving, taking actions needed to bring about recovery and receiving the assistance necessary to sustain it,&quot; says Edward V. K. Jaycox, World Bank vice president for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As figures presented to the World Summit for Children indicate, Africa's problems could readily worsen, if the resources are not found to attack the causes and if the population explosion continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 28 children who die around the world each minute, seven are in Africa. As in the rest of the world, two thirds of the 10,000 African children dying daily perish from preventable causes -- diarrhea, measles, tetanus and acute respiratory infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 71 leaders at the World Summit endorsed a plan of action committing their governments to a range of programs for &quot;the survival, protection, and development of children in the 1990s.&quot; One model is a United Nations immunization campaign launched in 1985, with a goal of reaching 80% of the world's children by the end of this year. James Grant, executive director of Unicef (United Nations Children's Fund), told a summit briefing the goal is likely to be reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide expenditure of $ 2.5 billion a year throughout this decade could prevent 50 million child deaths, Unicef says. Unicef puts the amount needed in context by pointing out that $ 2.5 billion is what American tobacco companies spend on advertising annually and what Soviets spend on vodka each month -- and what the world puts into military expenditures every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to World Bank President Barber Conable, there are signs that &quot;donors are willing to make special efforts to increase concessional assistance and debt relief to support Africa's economic reforms.&quot; Speaking to African finance ministers and central bank governors during last month's World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meeting, he said Africa's moves towards economic reforms and the response by donors is cause for &quot;guarded optimism&quot; about Africa's outlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there continues to be widespread concern about the social impact of IMF-inspired reform policies, particularly on the most powerless sectors of the population, especially children. Structural adjustment, as these reforms are known, generally entails reduced expenditure on health, education, and water resources. Unicef has led a campaign to give structural adjustment &quot;a human face&quot; by incorporating protections for the poor and vulnerable into the reforms. Unicef also insists that &quot;human indicators&quot; be considered alongside economic performance measurements in evaluating whether structural adjustment is succeeding or failing. &quot;Many studies have shown that investment in human resources is in fact the surest way to achieve and sustain long-term economic growth,&quot; Unicef says in a presentation prepared for the Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef advocates debt relief as a principal means of easing pressures on adjusting countries and of improving living standards for the poor. &quot;It would take only a little more than $ 6 billion spent on health, nutrition, water, and sanitation to save the lives of 18 billion African children by the year 2000,&quot; says Stephen Lewis, a Canadian diplomat who is special advisor on Africa to United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Africa's finances already stretched to the limit, where can $ 6 billion be found? &quot;You can't say it will come from trade or investment -- they're going down,&quot; Lewis says. &quot;You can't say it will come from foreign aid -- it's stagnating. You can't say it will come from exports -- commodity prices are plummeting.&quot; The only possible source, he argues, is debt relief.  Sub-Saharan African countries are expected to spend an estimated $ 9 billion each year throughout this decade on debt payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the World Bank's Jaycox says Africa's debt problem is being &quot;overblown.&quot; Since the debt payment obligations are not now being met by many countries, he argues, debt relief will not free new funds. And he concedes that there are not any other untapped sources for Africa either. &quot;There are no more doors to open for Africa,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That makes the newest added pressure -- rising oil prices -- a clear danger. With most of Africa already engaged in austerity reform programs, there is not &quot;a lot of room for further adjustment on their part,&quot; Jaycox says.  However, the Bank and the international donor community have &quot;virtually guaranteed&quot; that countries implementing reforms &quot;won't be underfinanced,&quot; he says.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The human rights group Africa Watch is calling for a cut in aid to Malawi because of human rights violations in the southern African nation. An Africa Watch report, &quot;Where Silence Rules: The Suppression of Dissent in Malawi,&quot; describes dozens of political imprisonments, killings and torture during the 26-year rule of Life-President Hastings Kamuzu Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 20 people were killed in Lilongwe last March, the group says, when police opened fire on a crowd of protesters. Since the Banda government tightly controls domestic news outlets and restricts foreign journalists, the slaughter went largely unnoticed. &quot;Malawi is proof that repression can work,&quot; Africa Watch says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The March protest, sparked by the discovery that a businessman had bribed a senior official in order to avoid arrest for killing an employee, shows the &quot;level of popular dissatisfaction&quot; in Malawi, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Africa Watch was denied entry to Malawi, the report says interviews with dozens of Malawian exiles indicate that the government arrests dissidents arbitrarily and detains them without charge or trial, often in squalid conditions. Torture by starvation and beating is routine. One political prisoner, Martin Machipisa Munthali, has been in prison for 25 years, though his nine-year sentence expired in 1974. Other prisoners include Jack Mapanje, one of Africa's most renowned poets, who was arrested upon publication of his book Of Cameleons and Gods in 1987, and Orton and Vera Chirwa, lawyers who founded the only known opposition group, the Malawi Freedom Movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Banda's rule, several exiled dissidents have died under mysterious circumstances. The Africa Watch report is dedicated to Malawian journalist Mkwapatira Mhango, who was killed by a bomb in neighboring Zambia along with members of his family. Africa Watch says the killing was intended to intimidate exiles into silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although groups such as Amnesty International have periodically accused Malawi of human rights violations, the country enjoys good relations with Western countries. But it appears to be gaining critics in the United States. Late last month, seven members of Congress, including Ronald Dellums (D-CA), William Green (D-NY) and Howard Wolpe (D-MI), sent a letter to Malawian Ambassador Robert Mbaya, commending Malawi for ratifying the African Charter on Human and People's Rights but pressing for the release of political prisoners that the Charter requires. &quot;We urge you to convey to Life-President Banda our hope that [those] held without charge might be released immediately and unconditionally unless recognizable and appropriate charges are levied before a court of law,&quot; the letter says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the U.S. government acknowledges human rights abuses in Malawi, it has recommended continuing the current level of aid for 1991. This year Malawi received $ 22 million in U.S. assistance, including more than $2 million in military aid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has promised that multipartyism will be discussed at the next congress of the ruling party, scheduled for March, 1991.

The country's 60,000-member trade union movement launched the strike to press demands for multiparty democracy and an easing of economic austerity measures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action closed the airport in the capital, Niamey, shut down schools, hospitals and government offices, and halted the mining of uranium, the country's main export.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike follows nearly a year of growing social unrest. In February, several demonstrators were killed by government troops who fired on university students protesting cuts in spending on education and other social needs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALEXANDRA, South Africa-- A large woman strides down a gloomy concrete corridor in the fortress-like women's hostel in Alexandra township outside Johannesburg. Emerging into the daylight, she looks at the small grass quadrangle in the center of the five-story buildings, encircled with barbed wire to prevent the destruction of the only patch of green.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know why the fighting happened in the hostels,&quot; says the formidable woman called &quot;Queen Phakati.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is because men are living singly. There are no women and children to calm the situation, and they forget -- when they fight -- that they will lose them all.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back inside the concrete maze, she pauses for a moment from her analysis of the recent violence to bellow cheerful greetings to other residents down the unlit corridor. &quot;Hey girl -- how are you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am fine. And how are you my baby?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a far cry from the war-ravaged men's hostels, where tired and despondent men sit in drafty rooms thinking of home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women's hostel is abuzz with the activity of over 2,800 women going about their daily chores. There is a feeling of sisterhood. Women stop to chat, or to complain, pausing in their washing, cooking and cleaning. They're strangely at home in the huge impersonal building, none of whose cheerfully decorated tiny rooms opens onto outdoor space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women pay the equivalent of about $ 10 a month for their meager space. There is no maintenance to speak of, and squabbles break out over basic facilities like water and lights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women are without their husbands, lovers or children. They have each other and, whether they like it or not, their interaction is just about as intimate as marriage. Four women share a bedroom of no more than about five square feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've always lived in the same room with another woman,&quot; says Elizabeth Mabiletsa, a 51-year-old company driver who has been at the hostel for fifteen years. &quot;The two of us are friends but sometimes we don't talk.  Sometimes she doesn't want to say good morning. When she's cross I just listen to my radio loud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabiletsa is divorced. She has children in Rustenburg. Every week she goes home, taking money and food to them. &quot;I am not happy here but I have no other place to go. My children cannot visit me here. I am tired now. I want to go home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She sits with other women around a steel table outside. A man from one of the two men's hostels in Alexandra is fixing their sewing machines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the same problems in the men's hostel,&quot; says Simon Phala, listening to the women arguing about the rent, about whether the &quot;block ladies&quot; do anything to help them, about whether they put pressure on the town council to lower the rent or to maintain the dilapidated building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popular opinion has it that the &quot;block ladies,&quot; who are supposedly elected from each block of 144 women, have become redundant. Some see them as stooges, unable to spur the council into action -- to fix the blocked drains and broken taps, to stop the stench in the blocked toilets, to deal with the piles of garbage that accumulate in dark corners, the broken windows, unreplaced corridor lights, dirty walls and lack of hot water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rows and rows of colorful washing flap in the wind. Women scurry from one room to another along the draughty corridors. Possibly because it is a public holiday, an air of relaxation pervades the place, and most women are ready to stop and recount at length their problems with the hostel, which they chose to name after the well-known white anti-apartheid activist Helen Joseph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the well-kept rooms, the warm smell of cooking and the feeling that somehow things are softer here than in the men's hostels, the place is clouded in depression. The women, many of whom are jobless and resort to informal sector industries like sewing and hawking food, are unhappy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the vast kitchens which resemble makeshift science labs, there are rows of gas burners, the tiny lockers are crammed with food and kitchenware lines the walls. Hunched over cups of tea or busy preparing food for themselves, they speak of their dissatisfaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People pay rent from the first to the seventh of every month. If you pay a day later, they charge you double, &quot; says factory worker Ma Ambe. She has lived at the hostel for ten years and is a dedicated member of the Alexandra Civic Organization (ACO), whose members include residents of the hostels and the neighboring black township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discontent with the conditions is boosting support for a four-month-long rent boycott initiated by ACO. More than half the residents have stopped paying rent in an attempt to force the local authorities to maintain the building or, alternatively, to convert the blocks into family units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the boycott began, the situation has deteriorated. &quot;Before we used to have water -- even if it was cold water. Now we have nothing,&quot; Ma Ambe says. The women must take their buckets to the township for water supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these women would jump at the chance to live elsewhere, there are queues of others waiting to come in. Not all the women have families or husbands; some would prefer to live in bachelor quarters. But many of the older women are reluctant to stop paying rent and risk eviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civic organization is pressuring the council to make public a financial accounting of how the hostel dwellers' rent is used. So far, the council has refused. But executive committee chairman Dennis Tau says the council is experiencing serious financial difficulties. &quot;The area where the residence is situated is currently being upgraded,&quot; he said, explaining the frequent interruptions in the water and electrical service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said negotiations are underway to privatize the hostel. &quot;It is the council's wish that the residences should be converted into housing units as we are presently experiencing a housing crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, hostel residents face an array of difficulties. Despite an advanced prison-like security system where electronic gates seal off blocks at the switch of a button from the supervisor's office, most women say they never feel safe. Men are prohibited from entering the building, but few security guards are in evidence. According to the women, one or two rapes occur almost every weekend. &quot;We are no longer safe because the police don't watch by the gate,&quot; says resident Violet Motobo. &quot;Many of us knock off very late. The police go to sleep and there is no security at night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a woman is attacked, she shouts &quot;Indoda!&quot; (man) and other women armed with sticks and brooms rush to her aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then we hit him. Some men have been killed in here,&quot; another women says. &quot;But no one gets arrested because they don't know who killed him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motobo goes off to find Jane Mogotso who recently found a man hiding in her room. Despite the vastness of the building and endless corridors lined with identical rooms, the communications network is swift and efficient. Motobo reappears minutes later with wizened-looking Mogotso, a cleaner at the family planning center in the hostel complex, which serves hostel-dwellers and the township. Mogotso recounts how she returned from her early-morning washing to find a man wedged behind her cupboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The friendly support structure acts as a buffer from the harshness of the impersonal living quarters. The residents contribute small amounts of money when someone dies. When a woman gives birth or falls ill she is rushed to the hospital in one of the few cars owned by the luckier hostel-dwellers, or an ambulance is called from a hostel resident's private telephone. Few have their own telephones, and the communal phones never work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But limited resources, cramped living conditions and a lack of recreation resources undercut the sisterhood, fueling petty rivalries, tribal differences and jealousy. &quot;There is often fighting in the rooms, sometimes even physical fighting,&quot; Mabiletsa says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are sometimes squabbles over things like the scarce water supply, the lack of space and -- given language differences -- which radio stations to play. Sometimes residents accuse each other of stealing washing, keeping the light on too late or waking everyone in the room when returning from night shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bribery and corruption are other sore points. Some women get rooms quickly because they know town councilors. And some &quot;favorite&quot; men are allowed to visit the police ladies, the security guards employed by the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We used to have a big room where we used to sew together,&quot; sighs Ma Ambe. &quot;Now the councilors' wives use this room for their sewing business. Why should we pay rent for these ladies to do their business?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no electric outlets in the room and the more resourceful women run their radios, hi-fi's and fridges from the single light bulb hanging from the ceiling. Such &quot;unfair advantages&quot; are the source of more resentment and daily bickering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason we fight is because of our situation,&quot; says Motobo. &quot;There is no privacy. If we had our own rooms it would be better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow the women remain stoic, even cheerful, about their unenviable lot. One sums up the situation: &quot;Yes, we are laughing but, really, it is terrible.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressures have prompted a number of resignations, notably that of Tom Boya, mayor of the Daveyton township outside Pretoria, who chaired the Urban Municipalities of South Africa, a nationwide body. &quot;I realized there was no room anymore for a person to serve in a structure created by the government,&quot; Boya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the boycotts, town councils controlled by the Conservative Party have cut off water and electricity in several areas.  Councils dominated by South Africa's ruling National Party generally have opted to negotiate with township residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In several of the largest urban centers, white city councils face a further complication. Since the councils were elected, many white voters have moved out of the cities and have been replaced by black residents, whose affairs remain under the control of the white councilors. Late last month, according to the Johannesburg weekly, the New Nation, black city dwellers occupied the Johannesburg city council chambers, demanding and receiving a hearing for their grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a mounting black death toll from the violence that has erupted between rival groups shows no sign of abating. The conflict has spread from Natal province, where nearly 5,000 people have died, into various parts of the Transvaal region -- which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria -- and to townships around Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the fighting has pitted ANC supporters against followers of Mangosutho Gatsha Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party and chief minister of the KwaZulu homeland. Other clashes have involved the Azanian People's Organization and the Pan Africanist Congress, two black consciousness-oriented movements that are critical of the ANC's pro-negotiations stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government responded toughly to the Transvaal disturbances. Coming on the heels of de Klerk's October decision to lift the state of emergency in Natal, the deployment of special forces and the imposition of curfews in the Transvaal was met with strong criticism by the ANC and other government opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela has charged that a &quot;third force&quot; is promoting the violence.  Right-wing white groups and members of government security services have been trying to undermine de Klerk's peace initiative, the ANC says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government critics believe one element of this suspected &quot;third force&quot; may be members of two hit squads created by the South African police and military in the 1980s to attack anti-apartheid activists inside the country and in exile abroad. There are charges that members of the Mozambican Resistance Movement (Renamo), as well as other insurgents that Pretoria armed and trained to destabilize neighboring countries, may also be involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gay J. McDougall, author of a critical examination of &quot;death squad&quot; activities recently published by the Washington, D.C.-based Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, warns that the government must act quickly to avert spiraling bloodshed. The study says Pretoria must: extend the investigation now underway; institute criminal procedures against anyone fomenting the violence; and extradite suspected death squad members from neighboring countries.  Otherwise, the Lawyers' Committee says, &quot;the assassination bureaus may simply shift to the cover of sympathetic right-wing organizations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The township tensions are also widely attributed to overcrowded living conditions, rising unemployment and the political uncertainties that have thrust both the ANC and Buthelezi's Inkatha into the new position of vying openly for public support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the violent outbursts in the Transvaal have involved Buthelezi's followers in the numerous single-sex hostels throughout the area, where residents live far from home, separated from their families for 10 months or more of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems confronting male hostel dwellers are shared by the smaller number of women living in hostels. Though they haven't responded with violence, the women have begun to express grievances in other ways. In the following article from the Johannesburg Weekly Mail, Phillipa Garson reports that women from a hostel in Alexandra, outside Johannesburg, have joined a rent boycott -- despite their own vulnerability to eviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first time in four years, Congress has placed restrictions on lethal assistance to the Angolan rebel movement Unita. Unita has received U.S. arms since 1986, when a decade-old Congressional ban on covert involvement in Angola, known as the Clark amendment, was overturned. The new legislation will suspend Unita aid completely when the Angolan government agrees to a cease-fire, multiparty elections and a suspension of Soviet military aid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restrictions come at a time of renewed efforts to end the 16-year conflict between Unita and the Angolan government, with Portugal acting as the mediator in peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress adopted the Unita aid limits following an unusual open debate on the issue in the House of Representatives on October 17th. The House defeated a proposal by Ronald Dellums and Mervyn Dymally -- California Democrats and Congressional Black Caucus members -- to end all CIA support for Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After rejecting the total aid ban by a vote of 246 to 175, House members approved a complex amendment sponsored by Stephen Solarz (D-NY) linking continuing aid to progress in the peace talks. The measure was adopted by a margin of 213 to 200, but then was almost defeated when Henry Hyde (R-OH), leading the opposition to both amendments, used a parliamentary maneuver to force another vote. The second tally ended in a tie, 206 to 206, which was broken by House Speaker Thomas Foley who cast the deciding &quot;yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A House/Senate conference committee approved a modified version of a bill containing most of the Solarz provisions. The new law caps 1991 spending for &quot;weapons, ammunition or other lethal equipment for Unita&quot; at a level no greater than that of 1990. It also requires suspension of all lethal aid if the Angolan government takes three specific steps. Luanda must agree to a cease-fire and a political settlement of the conflict, set a &quot;reasonable timetable for free and fair multiparty elections,&quot; and stop receiving weapons from the Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half the Unita aid for 1991 must be withheld by the administration until the Congressional intelligence committees agree to disbursement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conferees dropped a provision from the Solarz bill that would have permitted certification of Angola's compliance with these conditions by the president, or by the Congress in a joint resolution of both Houses. The compromise leaves certification to the president alone, who must also recertify compliance three months later. At that time, U.S. aid may be resumed if the Angolan government is not adhering to the prescribed conditions.  Aid may also be resumed if the Angolan government launches an offensive against Unita or there is &quot;clear and credible evidence&quot; that a military offensive is planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last month, Angola's ruling MPLA party adopted plans for establishing a multiparty system by the end of March, to be followed by a national census and elections within 36 months of a truce in the fighting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American economic assistance to Africa will rise in 1991, after last-minute Congressional budget deliberations that raised Africa's appropriation by 40% over the administration's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress also voted new guidelines on how the aid must be spent, linked some aid monies for Kenya to progress on human rights and prohibited any military assistance for Liberia, Somalia, Sudan or Zaire. In a separate action, Congress placed conditions on continued covert assistance to the Angolan rebel movement Unita (see page 13).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt, which is grouped with &quot;near east&quot; nations and not Africa, will continue as the leading U.S. aid recipient, along with Israel. A total of $ 2.1 billion was approved for the north African nation -- $ 815 million in economic assistance and $ 1.3 billion in military aid. In addition, Egypt's $6.7 billion military indebtedness to the U.S. was written off by Congress.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The breakthrough on the sub-Saharan aid increase came during late-hour discussions which preceded adoption of the foreign aid appropriations bill on October 27th, as Congress rushed to adjourn for the year. Following the lead of the House of Representatives, key Senators from both parties agreed to $ 800 million in development aid to sub-Saharan Africa, reversing a recent downward trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congressional Black Caucus initiated the 1991 increase earlier this year by proposing a $ 1 billion memorial to Rep. Mickey Leland, a Caucus member who died in a plane crash in Ethiopia last year. The House approved $ 800million in June -- $ 240 million more than the Bush administration requested.  But there seemed little prospect at the time for the increase to survive the lengthy budget-cutting debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when the Senate got down to final consideration of the $ 15 billion foreign aid bill in October, the $ 800 million figure was endorsed by two key members of the Appropriations Committee: Patrick J. Leahy (D-VT), who chairs the foreign operations subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the legislation, and Robert W. Kasten Jr. (R-WI), the subcommittee's ranking Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the level of need, we decided we wanted to increase the Development Fund for Africa (DFA) as much as we could,&quot; one Senate aide said.  &quot;We made it clear that this was a priority and we were not going to go below the House level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Democratic Whip William Gray (D-PA), along with Ronald Dellums (D-CA) and other Caucus members, lobbied their Senate colleagues for the aid increase, Congressional sources say. Among those who supported the larger figure were Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Paul Simon (D-IL), who chairs the Senate Africa subcommittee. House Africa subcommittee chairman Howard Wolpe and the subcommittee staff were also key promoters of the aid increase and the new policy language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration was seeking $ 560 million for the DFA budget, plus $ 56 million in Economic Support Funds (ESF), a form of aid generally linked to U.S. strategic concerns. The total administration package of $ 616 represented a$ 20 million increase over 1990 -- when Africa received the least American aid in a decade. But the administration request was still a $ 50 million drop from 1989 levels. The largest previous allocation for Africa was $ 759 million in 1985, when foreign aid expenditures peaked prior to Congressional adoption of the Gramm-Rudman budget-cutting directives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Development Fund for Africa was established by Congress in 1988 to emphasize a cost-effective, human-centered and long-term approach to assistance for the continent. But previous attempts by the House to spell out policy language for the fund in legislation have failed to win approval in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's act states that the purpose of the fund is to guarantee the poor majority a role in economic growth &quot;that is equitable, participatory, environmentally sustainable, and self-reliant.&quot; The measure also requires the Agency for International Development (AID), which administers foreign aid, to &quot;take into account the local-level perspectives of the rural and urban poor in sub-Saharan Africa, including women.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>LINKING AID TO HUMAN RIGHTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new foreign aid bill places restrictions on assistance to five sub-Saharan nations. A Senate-sponsored amendment requires the U.S. president to certify that the government of Kenya &quot;is taking steps on the release of political prisoners, stopping physical abuse, restoring independence of the judiciary and restoring freedoms of expression&quot; before committing any Economic Support Funds or military financing to the east African nation. The Bush administration has projected $ 7 million in ESF for Kenya in the coming year, and another $8 million in military financing. A planned $ 26 million in development assistance is unaffected by the amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Zaire, Congress stipulates that development assistance be dispensed only through non-governmental organizations, and not the government, which is widely regarded as corrupt. The new law also prohibits all military aid to Zaire, as well as for Liberia, Sudan and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other actions affecting Africa, Congress approved $ 13 million for the African Development Foundation, a U.S. institution which supports development projects in Africa with small grants. The administration had requested $ 11.5 million. Another $15 million was appropriated for countries in Africa &quot;which support conservation and biological diversity.&quot; The act also authorizes the president to support natural resources and wildlife management activities of &quot;friendly countries, international organizations, and private and voluntary organizations&quot; by providing &quot;excess&quot; materials and by transporting these items &quot;without charge on a space-available basis.&quot; In addition, the Defense Department appropriation bill provides $ 15 million for transportation of relief supplies worldwide.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>SPENDING THE INCREASE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a few exceptions, Congress is leaving the allocation of the $ 800 million development fund to AID. The exceptions are: $ 50 million for the ten-nation Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC); $ 3.5 million to support participation by disadvantaged South Africans in private enterprise development; and up to five percent of the $ 800 million toward AID's costs of administering the funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Capitol Hill deliberations, administration officials opposed the increase, saying it would exceed AID's capacity. A current hiring freeze prohibits AID from adding personnel. But the argument was rejected by Congressional supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task of managing disbursement now falls to Scott Spangler, who was sworn in as assistant administrator of AID for Africa on November 2nd. A presidential appointee, Spangler is an Arizona business executive and mechanical engineer who was active in George Bush's 1988 campaign. He served as a Ford Foundation fellow in Africa from 1963 to 1966 and has traveled to 18 African countries, according to his official biography.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A West African peace-keeping force has finally secured the Liberian capital of Monrovia enough to allow the arrival of emergency food aid. But conditions in the city, where an estimated 50-60 people are dying daily from hunger, dehydration and related diseases, remain chaotic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Belgian physician from the group Doctors Without Borders has blamed aid agencies and foreign governments for sending evaluation teams to look at the damage rather than to work on the problems. Dr. Pieter Rykelykhuizen told the Associated Press in neighboring Sierra Leone, where he arrived from Monrovia on a U.S. Marine helicopter, that &quot;relief workers and not assessment teams are needed&quot; because &quot;people are dying like flies.&quot; Rykelykhuizen said a U.S. shipment of nearly 2000 tons of rice and 40 tons of cooking oil on a chartered French ship is being off loaded much too slowly. He also said Liberians are now so malnourished that rice alone will not save them. Milk, fish and meat are essential, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies say security problems are delaying the shipment and hampering the distribution of supplies, but they are hopeful that the five-nation force sent to Liberia from the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) will soon have the situation under control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ecowas force was named to reflect its mission -- the Economic Community Monitoring Group, or Ecomog. But instead of being an observer or peace-keeping force, Ecomog's 7,000 soldiers have become embroiled in the continuing war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eco-bog&quot; is what one West African newsmagazine dubbed the morass in which the force finds itself, as it tries to separate Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) from the breakaway Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia, led by Taylor's rival, Prince Johnson. And then there are the remnents of the Liberian army that was loyal to the late President Samuel Doe. Critics say that instead of imposing order among the three groups, Ecomog has become a fourth faction in the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the worst blow to the West African force was the September kidnapping of Samuel Doe from Ecomog headquarters by Johnson's troops, who tortured and killed the President while recording the event on videotape.  Although cynics might say that Doe got as good as he gave -- he was an infamous torturer himself -- Ecomog's failure to protect him during his visit to its headquarters seriously damaged its reputation both inside and outside Liberia.  And the debacle widened the rift among Ecowas members, not all of whom support the Liberian intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, this month has brought new hopes that the worst is over.  David Nimely, Doe's successor as head of what was left of the Liberian army, has left the country. His forces and Johnson's have agreed to a ceasefire. And although proposed peace talks in Mali were cancelled last week after Taylor appeared unwilling to attend, an NPFL spokesman said the group does want a ceasefire and plans to attend an Ecowas summit on November 27th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also were signs that Ecowas may be mending some internal fences.  Togo, which had criticized the Liberia action, now appears ready to back it, although it remains the only French-speaking Ecowas member to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, an interim Liberian government chosen at an Ecowas-sponsored meeting of exiles on August 30th was scheduled to arrive in Monrovia this week under Ecomog protection. Led by university professor Amos Sawyer, the group is charged with preparing the country for free elections and beginning the daunting task of rehabilitation. A group of broadcast journalists and technicians from Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone is already in Monrovia, setting up a radio station so the interim government can spread its message throughout the country, most of which is still loosely controlled by Taylor's forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the reporter who became the voice from Liberia for millions of people around the world this year will not be playing that role again. The British Broadcasting Company's West Africa correspondent, Elizabeth Blunt, is returning to London for a new assignment. Following are excerpts from her Liberia journal, reprinted here with the permission of the BBC quarterly magazine Focus on Africa.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Monrovia, June 27-July 14</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The day of my arrival was the day of the great peace march, tens of thousands of Liberians led by their priests, Imams and preachers, coming out to ask the President to [resign], and finding themselves in the middle of a riot of gunfire. The last Air Guinea flight brought me in over a deserted city, to colleagues still shaking after spending two hours huddled in an outhouse while bullets whistled around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That night the water stopped flowing; two days later the electricity, and on Monday, July 2nd the rebels attacked the outskirts of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the beginning of the anarchy: suddenly the soldiers, knowing the time left to them was very short, abandoned all discipline. Anyone with a gun could take anything from anyone without a gun. For a week there were no shops, no markets, no offices working. The phones were cut, the radio off the air. After curfew, soldiers looted and settled scores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But people become used to almost anything. Ten days later, we were learning to live with the shots in the night, the daily search for water and food. Some shops opened and the Ministry of Information pulled itself together enough to revoke my accreditation and send me home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seemed bad enough at the time: yet what came later makes it seem a time of ease. This was before fighting engulfed the whole city, before rockets fired from the executive mansion began to land in crowded suburbs, before the massacre [of 600 people] at St. Peter's Church [by Doe's troops].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally the fighting got more and more bogged down, with no side able to overcome the other, and diplomatic moves became more important -- the Ecowas summit , and the decision to send the peacekeeping force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summarized like that, it sounds as if I have had a very exciting few months. And it's true. For a journalist, it is exciting to have a good story, and to see it develop from the beginning. It's exciting to be right in the middle of events, especially when you know that it is your radio which is the most listened to, the way that most people get their information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no doubt at all that throughout the conflict in Liberia, the BBC has had the nearest thing possible to a saturation audience. Some afternoons it seems as if every man, woman and child in Liberia who understands English and has a radio is listening to the BBC. The BBC was the way Liberians got their news, and anyone who wanted to talk to Liberians was doing it on the BBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is where we come to the major problem -- the way in which the BBC has been used in this conflict, and used far more skillfully by some parties than others. Charles Taylor, in particular, built his campaign on publicity and used the BBC to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the war, the National Patriotic Front has used the BBC as its platform, while the government side has treated the media with the utmost suspicion. President Doe has given huge press conferences, he has invited me to come and talk to him in the Executive Mansion, but has only once agreed to be interviewed, and that on a very scratchy radiophone, since the conflict started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When one side talks freely and the other refuses, what should the BBC do? Should we ration Taylor to the same amount of airtime as Doe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We compromised by agreeing to talk to Taylor but asking difficult questions, about his past and his financial record and so on. But this is not entirely the answer. Charles Taylor is a wonderful talker. An exasperated interviewer once said, &quot;No one seems to have a good word to say for you, Mr.  Taylor&quot;. His reply -- &quot;They said the same about Jesus Christ himself when he was on earth&quot;-- got the audience right back on his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even restricting his air time didn't always have the expected results. I was once harangued by a senior Ministry of Information official because the BBC didn't broadcast one of Taylor's press conferences. What were we hiding, he wanted to know. Was Taylor still alive? And how else would the government know what he was up to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the problem of the reporter's perspective. As it chanced, I saw the war virtually exclusively from the government side of the lines. In most wars, the government concerned would have been delighted: most governments move heaven and earth to stop reporters consorting with their rebels. But the Liberian war is not most wars, and another of the harangues I got from the Ministry of Information was about why I never reported the nasty things the rebels were doing, only the nasty things on the government side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this is true. However conscientiously I report that the rebels are also committing atrocities, they are not atrocities I have seen with my own eyes, and they are never going to be as vivid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And one should never underestimate the journalist's inbuilt instinct to side with the underdog, to make mischief, to cock a snook at authority. It took a long time before President Doe began to look like the underdog in his war with Charles Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So where does that leave the BBC? With a big audience, certainly, and a big responsibility. And with the accusation that it was BBC airwaves that let the rebels get as far as they did, and with the fear that this criticism may be justified. But also with the sense that the balance has shifted. In the beginning, President Doe was known by his acts, Charles Taylor only by his words. Now, enough time has gone by for Taylor's acts to begin to speak for themselves. Now armed men on both sides are trying to find BBC reporters and kill them. I suppose I should be happy.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>To Monrovia with Ecomog, September 3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ecomog peacekeeping force arrived in Monrovia on August 25th. I travelled to Liberia by boat from Freetown a week later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My first drive up to town from the port was a shock. Everything shattered, broken and filthy. Every building lining the road from the port was full of holes -- peppered with bullets and holed by shells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the people: what was left of the population of Monrovia wandered to and fro in endless lines, hunting, hoping to find something to eat. In six weeks, prosperous looking friends had slimmed so much I could hardly recognize them. Poorer people were hollow cheeked and gaunt. This wasn't the kind of food shortage where only the rich could afford to eat. No matter how rich you were, there was no rice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days fell into a routine: Ecomog briefings -- not very exciting, since Ecomog was making little movement: the hunger was the most important story.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Sunday, September 9</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Routine visit to Ecomog headquarters. Waiting for an interview when there was a flurry of excitement -- President Doe had arrived unexpectedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then confused shouting -- Johnson's men were there. Soon they were striding up and down stairs, loud and threatening. Voices rose, guns were being cocked.  Then a Nigerian officer grabbed me. &quot;In there: lie down. Lie down.&quot; Prince Johnson came into the office where I was, shouting and raving, two Ecomog officers trying to calm him. I saw the hands of one of them shaking as he tried to open a can of beer for Johnson. Then I heard Johnson yelling, &quot;Men, open fire. Open fire!&quot; And that was it. For an hour and a half I lay on the floor in the middle of a deafening gunbattle. I could hear Johnson: &quot;Let's get Doe. We'll get him this time.&quot; Ecomog officers were begging, pleading for sanity. Every time it stopped and I raised my head, the firing started again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally there was silence, stunned silence. The survivors crept out.  The corridor was pooled with blood. Bodies were everywhere. And President Doe was gone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VOM: What is the time frame for independence?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issaias: Precision on a matter of this kind is impossible.  What is clear is that compared to the long struggle we have conducted -- over a quarter of a century now -- the road ahead is far shorter.  But in this sensitive period, it is difficult to give an exact timetable and assert with full certainty that the task will be accomplished in one, two or three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I can say is that, even with all the uncertainties, it is now a matter of months.  Even if something unpredictable happens, we are confident that we will be able to handle it.  Our desire is to bring the suffering to an end soon.  We have full confidence in our capacity to do so.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VOM: Do we have blueprints for economic development on this eve of independence?  Can we avoid the pitfalls of economic crises in which many Third World countries find themselves?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issaias: There are lessons we can learn from the economic failures of the Third World.  Many countries are grappling with intractable economic problems, even those which possess substantial resources, including oil.  The problem is related to the overall political structure, to issues of management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many cases, political power is abused to advance the personal wealth of those at the top, at the expense of national interest.  Corruption is rife, millions of dollars are embezzled and siphoned off.  Big capital often extracts inordinate profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a rampant brain drain because intolerant systems cannot accommodate educated and skilled manpower and, consequently, drive trained people abroad.  There is a tendency to suppress local talent.  For these reasons, many viable community projects fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will have to avoid these malaises in tomorrow's Eritrea.  For this, the political system must be healthy; free from corruption, nepotism and theft.  The proper interaction and balance between foreign and private capital must be rigorously defined and regulated by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have to embark on intensive training programs to upgrade local skills and increase our capacity to absorb and cope with advanced technology.  At the same time, we have to avoid the trappings of capital-intensive enterprises in agriculture and manufacturing industry when better results can be produced on a small scale with local skill and resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign capital will certainly play a big role in investment.  But there must be proper mechanisms to regulate the transactions and harness it to the national interest.  State capital can create obstacles to private and foreign capital unless it is kept within reasonable bounds.  It must not be permitted to exceed its limits and strangle the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, our approach will be based on realism and a prudent evaluation of all these factors.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Democracy and Participation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VOM: Do you think that the preconditions exist for the multiparty system which the EPLF says it intends to establish in Eritrea?  Will the EPLF allow religious parties?  How do you respond to the charge of those who allege that the EPLF will monopolize power in an independent Eritrea?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issaias: The EPLF has already underlined its commitment to create a multiparty system in Eritrea.  This position stems from its strong belief that this is the only system that can guarantee national cohesion, development, peace and stability in Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a future Eritrea, different interest groups will naturally seek to pursue their own interests.  Their freedom to do this can only be secure when each individual's or group's basic political rights are guaranteed by law.  If any individual, group or section of the society is allowed to be above the law and to politically, economically or culturally dominate the others, there cannot be the peace and stability which will be a key to our progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For these reasons, a one-party system will neither enhance national security or stability nor accelerate economic development.  In fact, a one-party system could be a major threat to the very existence of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the practicalities of forming a multiparty system need to take into account the specifics of our situation.  To start with, it has to be accepted that at present our armed struggle for national liberation overrides any political principles that do not contribute to strengthening the objective of the current phase.  In practice, there cannot be basic rights while we are under occupation.  At present, therefore, the Eritrean people's priority ought to be strengthening the armed struggle to achieve our national liberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPLF sees its mandate as being limited to the time when independence is achieved.  It [the EPLF] might perhaps be charged with provisional responsibilities to run the country until such time as a genuine multiparty system is established.  As to what will happen to the EPLF after that, nobody can answer.  In general, even though each member might have his/her opinion or principles, it would not be right to seek to impose them on others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existing organizations are not the microcosm of the future parties; they do not necessarily reflect the spectrum of political parties that may develop in an independent Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A controversial point often raised in relation to political pluralism is whether the model is sustainable in Third World countries, with their heterogeneous societies and in the absence of the industrial and political developments of the West.  There is an element of truth in this concern, although it is sometimes deliberately overemphasized in order to curb democratization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, if there are internal or external forces that seek to foment tribal and ethnic differences -- and if the political parties become the flagships for these tendencies -- the result will be debilitating instability and civil strife.  The casualty in this case will not only be pluralism as a model but democracy itself.  There is thus a necessity for consistent political work to enlighten the public to these dangers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious parties in Eritrea would, sooner or later, spark civil strife and hence jeopardize national unity.  So while the freedom of faith must be respected and religious institutions enabled to proselytize without restrictions of any kind, there must be a ban on religious political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same rule should apply to regional and ethnic movements.  These issues must be sorted out, the provisions and restrictions defined unambiguously by law, before embarking on pluralism.  An ethnic or religious group which constitutes a majority may want to form a political party to assert its dominance.  At the other end of the scale, a minority group may exploit legitimate grievances, induced by uneven development and denial of opportunities in the past, as a basis for forming a separate political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, these are matters that require the equality, in real terms, of all citizens before the law.  They should not be the preserve of a specific religious or ethnic group.  Political parties should represent different premises and alternative programs for national political, economic and social development.  This is the political climate underpinning a stable and healthy pluralist system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Eritrea, there are other factors that must be borne in mind.  Small as it is, Eritrea remains a heterogeneous society with diverse linguistic and religious constituencies.  The administrative system must therefore be highly decentralized with the different regions -- delineated on geographical and other criteria -- enjoying scope to develop specific institutions that correspond to their cultural particularities.  The actual form this takes may vary.  But the degree of devolution to the constituent parts needs to be quite high.  Political pluralism should take this into account.  The whole concept requires careful analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will the EPLF become intolerant?  True, the EPLF has paid heavy sacrifices, carried the burden of struggle alone and surmounted many obstacles.  This reality perhaps causes uneasiness in some quarters. But the EPLF is perfectly aware of the limitations of its mandate.  It has never entertained the illusion of monopolizing power in Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VOM: Why is a referendum [the EPLF calls for a UN-supervised vote to determine Eritrea's future] necessary when the Eritrean people have already affirmed their aspiration for independence through the armed struggle?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issaias: The issue is a question of principle and international law.  Our armed struggle is only a means to an end, not an end itself.  It was waged to enable the Eritrean people to exercise their self-determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no alternative to referendum. The overwhelming majority of Eritreans have demonstrated their desire for self-determination in practical terms through struggle and sacrifice.  But the need to legitimize our aspirations in the eyes of the world cannot be ignored.  If we simply use the fait accompli of force to achieve our ends, we will be betraying the real objective of our struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not a question of emotion, it is a matter of international law.  To establish normal relations with other nations based on mutual respect, we must be accepted by the world community of nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VOM: A segment of our society does not permit women to play a role in the struggle or have a dignified status in the community.  How do you see their role in the coming years?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issaias: I believe this is an issue long settled.  Perhaps one of the hallmarks of our struggle is its achievement in raising the degree and level of women's participation that exceeds, in some areas, even those of men.  Obviously, it is impossible to eradicate all inequalities and change attitudes in the society as a whole in a matter of ten to twenty years.  But so much has been achieved already, thanks to the struggle of women themselves and the policies of the Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not interested in token changes.  The depth of social transformation -- in relation to the status of women - must not be measured by the ability of a few women to assume high levels of authority.  The job involves paving the way for the full participation of women -- their ability to assume the same functions as their male counterparts in the emerging and future Eritrea.  Compared to the realities in our region and the experiences in other places, the opportunities for women in Eritrea are unlimited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may, of course, still be isolated cases where religious leaders or highly traditional communities attempt to curb the role of women on the basis of the scriptures or communal law.  On the whole, we have handled these obstacles with caution and patience.  At this stage, there is almost total consensus in the society as a whole.  People recognize and have taken for granted the equality and growing role of women in a future Eritrea.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>External Policies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VOM: Why does the EPLF continue to release Ethiopian POWs while the Dergue [the Ethiopian government] keeps in jail and tortures captured EPLF fighters? How can we exchange our captured fighters if we set free all Ethiopian POWs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issaias: We have never expected and do not pursue a policy of exchanging prisoners of war.  The Dergue continues to routinely execute captured EPLF members.  The few who may be released are emaciated by intense torture and years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dergue also routinely disowns its captured soldiers.  So we cannot reasonably entertain the possibility of exchanging prisoners with this regime.  We tried to put pressure on the regime through the intermediary of international organizations - such as the International Committee of the Red Cross.  But our efforts have not borne fruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these circumstances we cannot lower our moral standards in order to counter the regime.  We cannot execute POWs because the Dergue massacres captured fighters.  The respect for life and the humane treatment of POWs stem from moral values that cannot and should not be eroded by the brutality of the enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VOM: What is the extent of Israeli involvement against Eritrea?  What are the motives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issaias: The Ethiopian government has been courting the Arab states in order to isolate the Eritrean cause.  But with the recent changes in the Soviet Union, the Dergue began to have serious doubts about the prospects of continued military support from the latter and began to search for alternative sources.  To this end, it suddenly renewed diplomatic relations with Israel.  The objectives of this measure were clear: to enlist the military assistance of Israel and also extend the alliance for restoring good relations with the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Israelis, on their part, perceive considerable benefits in this relationship.  From their point of view, there is a threat to their security from Arab control of the Red Sea and they consequently strive to forge alliances with friendly littoral states.  This is the general context underpinning Israeli interest in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with this approach is the durability of the Addis Ababa regime and what it portends for the future.  For the moment, the Falasha issue [the attempt by Ethiopian Jews, known as Falashas, to emigrate to Israel] has prompted Israel to give limited assistance to Ethiopia, mainly in the training of pilots and cooperation in security.  So far this has not gone beyond tactical assistance. People should not overemphasize the relations between Ethiopia and Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VOM: Access to the sea is an issue of utmost concern to Ethiopia. The EPLF has often hinted that this is a matter that can be amicably resolved between two neighboring countries. What does this involve?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issaias: The EPLF does not intend to use the Eritrean ports as an instrument to strangle Ethiopia or exacerbate its economic problems. Our vision transcends such issues to encompass wide-ranging and constructive cooperation between the two peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides have to recognize that they are neighbors -- that neither side can benefit at the expense of the other. Mutually beneficial arrangements regulating cooperation in industry, agriculture, communications and port facilities can be worked out once a genuine commitment to work for the common good prevails on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPLF believes that the current climate of hostility and conflict in the region as a whole can gradually be overcome and replaced by a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">443 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wars that range across remote, technically undeveloped areas do not lend themselves to press conferences nor to direct interaction between local people and those who claim to fight on their behalf. So to mark the beginning of the 30th year of the war for Eritrea's independence from Ethiopia, the radio service of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) decided to air a talk-show with EPLF Secretary-General, Issaias Afewerki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since a call-in show is impossible in a place where telephones reach only limited areas, the radio service, known as VOM, advertised the plan on the air and solicited questions by mail. By the closing date of mid-August, over 1,100 questions had been received; after weeding out repetitions, VOM editors distilled the number of queries to 540.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the VOM moderator of the interview, many listeners asked for personal details about the EPLF leader, including his age, educational background and experiences in the armed struggle. Ducking the questions, Issaias -- a former engineering student in his early 40s -- said the time for personal reminiscences may come after the war is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the VOM persisted. The moderator said that the EPLF practice of rarely talking about its leadership, although designed to avoid cults of personality, poses a danger &quot;that this routine evasion of personal details imparts an image of a struggle led by anonymous people.&quot; The moderator urged Issaias to &quot;make a few comments on these personal details, both in order to break this taboo and in view of the big number of questions asked on the topic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Issaias demurred. The struggle is rich with heroes and martyrs, he said, and when the history of Eritrea's war is recorded, there should be an attempt to reclaim those experiences for the nation as a whole. &quot;If time and circumstances allow, if I will still be around,&quot; Issaias said, &quot;I would be prepared to contribute my share to this collective undertaking. I would like to ask those who have posed the questions to excuse me until such an opportune moment arises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the avoidance of personal questions must have left many Eritrean listeners unsatisfied, Issaias responded in detail to hundreds of other questions, and VOM broadcast the lengthy conversation over a seven-day period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parts of the interview appear in the October issue of the EPLF publication Adulis, from which the following questions and answers are excerpted.  (For a view from the other side, see excerpts from the interview with Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam conducted by Charlayne Hunter-Gault for the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour, Africa News, May 28, 1990.)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bush administration has stepped up contacts with the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean independence movement, amid indications that both sides in the three-decade conflict are seeking an end to the fighting. On October 4th, in Washington, D.C., the U.S. hosted a meeting between Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tesfaye Dinka and Ali Said Abdallah, foreign relations chief for the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to avoid a battlefield defeat, Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam has discarded his regime's Marxist trappings, resumed relations with Israel, and allied himself with the international coalition against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials say the military regime in Addis Ababa continues to receive Soviet military assistance, although the level of Moscow's aid has dropped considerably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 25th, Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen raised the issue during a meeting in Rome with Yuri A. Yukalov, head of the Soviet foreign ministry's Africa Directorate. State Department aides say that although Moscow supports the American mediation effort, the Soviets argue that they can best contribute to peace by retaining some ties to Mengistu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian government proposes to end the war by establishing a federated structure that would allow local autonomy for Eritrea. It argues that until 1886, when Italy invaded Eritrea, the area had been an integral part of the Ethiopian empire. Eritreans counter that the Organzation of African Unity recognizes Africa's colonial boundaries as the basis for modern states. The EPLF insists on a United Nations-supervised referendum that would offer Eritreans the option of choosing independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mediation attempt by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere last spring was unsuccessful in bridging the gap between the two positions. The persistence of that gap in the latest talks leaves many observers doubting that a settlement can be achieved without more fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Ethiopian Second Army under siege in Eritrea's capital Asmara, Mengistu is also facing a military reversal closer to home. A force led by the Tigray People's Liberation Front, which is seeking the military regime's overthrow, advanced to within 100 miles of Addis Ababa earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the changing strategic situation in the region, the Ethiopian leader may gain a breathing spell. Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia's neighbor across the Red Sea, has made overtures to the Mengistu government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the last year, Mengistu has cultivated relations with Israel, which is believed to have supplied Ethiopia with cluster bombs and other military aid to offset dwindling Soviet supplies. Despite U.S. protests, Israeli shipments continued until July, when the arms flow was cut after Ethiopia reportedly failed to honor a commitment to allow free emigration of the Ethiopian Jews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 1st, Ethiopia announced a new agreement to allow all Ethiopian Jews to leave for Israel. Although Ethiopia denied any linkage between emigration and Israeli arms, the announcement is sure to enhance ties both with Israel and with the U.S., which has made the resumption of ambassadorial relations contingent on the approval for Jewish emigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with an increasing number of other African governments, Ethiopia has retained two Washington firms to lobby Congress and disseminate information in the U.S. The Pagonis and Donnelly Group has a $ 16,000-a-month contract for &quot;rebuilding the long-term ties&quot; between the two governments, while Henry J.  Kaufman and Associates is receiving $ 25,000 a month to polish Ethiopia's image with the American public and news media.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The longest war in modern African history appears to be nearing its final phase. But the prospect of fierce fighting in the coming weeks, combined with a severe drought in the region, is threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-nine years ago last month, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) launched its fight for the independence of Eritrea, a former Italian colony that Ethiopia claims as a province. Now the independence movement is poised to seize Asmara, Eritrea's capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for the southern town of Assab, the Asmara area is the only part of Eritrea still controlled by the Ethiopian government. More than a million civilians and an Ethiopian army garrison of 120,000 are trapped in the city and its environs, surrounded by Eritrean forces and dependent on a costly and uncertain airlift for food and other essential supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A September 20th report by the human rights group Africa Watch accuses the Ethiopian government of using starvation as a weapon in the battle for Asmara. The group says that although the EPLF &quot;has shown inflexibility in responding to requests for the safe delivery of humanitarian relief...the primary responsibility for the current disaster lies with the Ethiopian government, which is using the civilian population as a weapon to achieve its military objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa Watch condemns the Ethiopian government for refusing to let civilians flee the city. Ethiopia is using Asmara residents as hostages, the group says, to discourage an EPLF attack, even though the captive population has begun to starve. Africa Watch appeals to both sides for a truce that would enable food to get in and people to get out of the besieged area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPLF says it will cooperate with international efforts to transport food overland into Asmara, but the group has refused to stop shelling the Asmara airport, the only current supply line. Out of a dozen daily flights into Asmara, only two or fewer are part of a United Nations-sponsored airlift that provides a fraction of civilian needs. The remainder are Ethiopian military supply flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian Catholic Secretariat (ECS), which is coordinating the UN airlift, has appealed to international donors for additional planes to supplement the two Hercules aircraft chartered for the relief effort. The need to build up supplies in the city is urgent, the ECS says, since the EPLF may force the airport to close at any time. So far, there has been no response to the appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Connell, a founder of the Boston-based development aid group Grassroots, is working on a book about the Eritrean conflict. He returned last week from his 14th visit to Eritrea, where he says EPLF-controlled territory, as well as the Asmara area, is threatened by famine. The lack of any rainfall at all in parts of Eritrea, and sparse rains elsewhere, has affected two million of Eritrea's two and a quarter million people, Connell says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need to end the war and concentrate on relief and development is pushing EPLF strategists toward a final offensive, Connell believes. But he says the group is weighing several factors before attacking Asmara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, there is the question of how the Ethiopian government would respond to an assault on the Eritrean capital. When the EPLF captured the Red Sea port of Massawa last February, Ethiopian bombing raids killed over a hundred people and destroyed 25,000-50,000 tons of food aid. The EPLF may be reluctant to take the capital, only to see it bombarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the EPLF is considering how it might provide food and social services in Asmara after it controls the city. Already hard-pressed to get relief to the drought-stricken countryside, the group's resources would be further strained by the responsibility for Asmara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, the EPLF must take into account the international response to an offensive. How would an attack affect the potential political or economic support for Eritrean independence?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the Eritrean fighters are concerned, Connell says, that the coming battle for Asmara cost as little as possible in lives. Already the siege has continued for over 200 days. And aid officials worry that the city's population -- regarded by the Ethiopians as largely favoring the EPLF -- is increasingly at risk from a jittery soldiery as well as from famine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connell says the EPLF is looking for ways to undermine the Ethiopian army's willingness to fight. One approach may be a two-stage strategy whose first step is closing the airport. Without air supplies, soldiers stranded at the Asmara garrison could become demoralized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another possibility is an EPLF thrust across the border toward the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, to increase pressures within the Ethiopian government and possibly lead to the downfall of Ethiopian strongman Mengistu Haile Mariam. Eritrean leaders have said repeatedly that only if democracy takes root in Ethiopia can an independent Eritrea be secure. (In the past, the EPLF has indicated that Eritreans might agree to become part of a future democratic Ethiopia.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a widespread feeling in Eritrea that Mengistu -- though buffeted by war -- cannot afford defeat, either on the battlefield or at the negotiating table. &quot;It is rather obvious, says EPLF leader Issaias, &quot;that the defeat of the Ethiopian army would entail the removal of the Dergue,&quot; the ruling military council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, both the Eritreans and the foreign aid workers in the territory worry about what Mengistu will do when faced with further losses. Few believe he is ready to accept what more and more observers regard as inevitable. &quot;Evidently he has gone too far in blood and violence to turn back now,&quot; says British journalist David Hirst of the London Guardian</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I came upon this document today while rummaging through my pile of documents. I thought to share it with your reading public, especially those interested in recent Liberian history. Any editorial or public use of this document, whether now or in the future, as long as is for our common good is herewith authorized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document is the first policy statement of Mr. Charles Ghankay Taylor, as leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (unedited). The statement was released on January 1, 1990. It reads:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the bloody military coup of April 12, 1980, which brought the regime of Master Sargeant Samuel K. Doe to power in Liberia, the Liberian people have endured 10 years of oppression, summary killings, human rights violations, ethnic genocide, gross economic mismanagement and blatant widespread corruption.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1985, despite threats and intimidation, the Liberian people turned out in massive numbers to express their will at the polls for a peaceful change of government, only to see the electoral process subverted by the Doe regime which unilaterally declared itself the winner, despite all independent evidence to the contrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the aborted elections a popular resistence movement under the leadership of the late Commanding General Thomas Quaiwonkpa sought to overturn the Doe regime with minimal force and restore Democracy to Liberia. The Doe regime brutally put down this uprising and took harsh retaliation against innocent civilians in the northern counties, taking hundreds of innocent lives and forcing thousands of Liberians to flee their homes as refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having exhausted every possible avenue of reason and having seen every effort to peacefully effect a change of governance by constitutional means crushed by the harshest use of force, we the members of the National Patriotic Front under the leadership of Charles Ghankay Taylor feel it is our right and bounded duty to rid the people of Liberia of this cancerous despotism by whatever means at our disposal with the following objectives:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The restoration of full constitutional democracy to the Liberian people through free, fair and open elections to be conducted as soon as practically possible following the conclusion of military actions and the restoration of law and order to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The rebuilding of the Liberian economy on the basis of our traditional free enterprise system and the protection of private property, without excessive government bureaucracy and public corruption but with concern for health, education housing, employment and food for the vast majority of our populace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The unification of all Liberian people without regard to class, social status, ethnic origin, religion or political philosophy in the common task of nation-building. The National Patriotic Front is a broad-based, popular, non-sectarian nationalist movement which believes in the right of every Liberian to equal protection and opportunity under the law and which does not subscribe to ethnic and social factionalism or recriminations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The National Patriotic Front is not beholden to any foreign group or power and believes in the maintenance of Liberia's traditional relationships with its close friends and allies, particularly the United States, and intends to work closely with these foreign partners in the reconstruction of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The National Patriotic Front believes strongly in the implementation of all fundamental human rights guaranteed to every citizen of Liberia by the constitution, particularly the right of life, liberty and security; the right to freedom of the thought, expression, movement and peaceful assembly; and the right to equal protection and due process under the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We, therefore, call upon every patriotic Liberian, including the many truly patriotic elements of the Armed Forces of Liberia, and all freedom-loving peoples everywhere to make every sacrifice and join with us in this right and historic struggle to free the Liberian people and nation of the shackles of tyranny and injustice once and for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This statement speaks for itself. I hope Mr. Taylor can find the time to read it today in case he needs to be reminded of the wonderful Liberia he envisaged &quot;for all of us&quot; in 1990. ... A Liberia of equal protection and opportunity under the law. A Liberia where the fundamental rights of every citizen would be guaranteed under the constitution, particularly the right to life, liberty, security, freedom of thought, expression and movement and peaceful assembly? I guess all the people who have fallen victim to wanton brutality and outright murder by this regime could not have been Liberians. How else can we explain the deaths of Nowai Flomo, Dogoleah, the Dokies, Chucky's driver (Isaac Gono) who was flogged to death without any credible explanation? Could it also be that James Torh, Commany Wisseh, Sawyer, Bishop Francis, etc., etc., are foreigners? I don't think so. But as Ronald Reagan once said, &quot;people don't start wars, governments do.&quot; In as much as some of us detest the current war on our people in Lofa based in the hollowed integrity of its proponents, I believe the &quot;cancer&quot; alluded to by the NPFL in their statement is still gnawing at the freedom, liberty, happiness and peace of Liberia. And again as the NPFL statement said, &quot;it is our right and bounded duty to rid the people of Liberia of this cancerous despotism by whatever means at our disposal.&quot; Albert Einstein once said, &quot; The world is a dangerous place not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.&quot; That's our challenge.</SPAN></P>
