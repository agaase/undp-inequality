<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pressures are building on Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor tothe fighting that flared between his National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and the multi-national West African peacekeeping force (Ecomog) in mid-October. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Leonard Robinson says that the United States holds Taylor &quot;personally responsible&quot; for the latest outbreak of fighting in the West African nation, founded by freed American slaves in 1847.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International observers say Taylor's forces attacked the country's capital, Monrovia, and the Ecomog troops that guard it.  But, Taylor insists that his fighters are simply defending themselves and the people of Liberia from unwarranted foreign aggression.  He maintains that the actions of the NPFL have been justified and has asked for UN intervention to &quot;halt the killing of Liberians&quot; by Ecomog soldiers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International attention to the fighting in Liberia soared after reports of the killing of five American nuns in NPFL-controlled territories.  Robinson says he holds Taylor responsible for the nuns' deaths, describing rebel fighters as &quot;undisciplined' and &quot;drug-crazed.&quot; Members of a Roman Catholic order have issued pleas for the return of the nuns' bodies for burial. Sister Margaret Mary Kopish testified before the House subcommittee on Africa, describing eyewitness reports of the nun's killings by Taylor's soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebel leader denies any involvement in the murders and invited U.S. officials to conduct an impartial investigation into the matter. Taylor promised that if his troops were found responsible for any wrongdoing, they would be held accountable, and the international community would be made aware of their punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN Security Council has imposed an arms embargo, in an effort tohalt Taylor's advance and return control of the country to Ecomog forces and interim President Amos Sawyer. Neighboring Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso have been accused of illegally supplying Taylor with weapons, although both nations say they are observing the boycott. The United Nations also has agreed to send a special representative to investigate the possibility of future peace talks in this war-ravaged country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For over two weeks, rain has fallen in drought stricken Zimbabwe,bringing hopes for an end to the worst drought in 100 years across southern Africa.  Over 18 million people in the region's ten nations are in danger of starvation due to the destruction of food crops by drought and the general lack of water.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In some areas of the country, including the capital, Harare, up to three inches of rain have fallen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although southern Africans have being waiting anxiously for the rains,there have been some unfortunate and unanticipated side effects of the sudden showers. Many farmers have reported that the deluge of rain has washed out crops that had just been planted. At least a dozen people have been killed by lightning or trapped under mud squatter shacks that have collapsed. The rains have even interrupted Zimbabwe's popular sporting events, postponing international cricket matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Food aid shipments also were interrupted, when rains swept away bridges and made roads impassable. About ten million Zimbabweans currently receive food aid from international donors. Leaders from southern African nations have appealed to the United Nations for increased attention to the region's increasingly perilous situation. Southern Africa has been competing for food aid with the famine struck nations of the Horn of Africa; in the Horn, some 23 million people are threatened by famine. At least 40 million people are suffering from hunger in Eastern and Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>

The name of the Central African country would become the Federal Republic of Congo much like its neighbor, the Republic of Congo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the draft, the president would serve as a largely ceremonial figure, and the country would be governed by a Prime Minister and an elected multi-party parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mobutu threatened to halt the democracy conference last August when a similar proposal was made. His supporters boycotted the gathering, and the president has suggested that his loyalists might issue an alternative proposal for the new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was Mobutu who changed the country's name from Congo to Zaire afterhe seized power in a 1965 coup. Although the president yielded to protestors demanding a multi-party system two years ago, critics claim that he has engineered numerous delays in the transition to democracy. No date for a national referendum on the new constitution has been set.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six weeks after President Joaquim Chissano's government and the rMozambique National Resistance Movement (Renamo) signed a peace accord ending 16 years of civil war, the people of the former Portuguese colony are hopeful that peace has finally come to stay. After nearly two years of talks, a truce has allowed Renamo forces to retain control of large areas of central Mozambique, unchallenged by government forces.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time since 1982, a passenger bus has traveled into Renamo's former main base at Gorongosa without a military escort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the fact that humanitarian aid now is reaching remote areas, many Mozambicans are leaving their isolated villages and migrating toward the towns. Thousands of refugees who fled to nearby countries are returning to Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Food relief workers are concerned that current food supplies are not sufficient to deal with the sharp increase in demand. Meetings are being held throughout the country to improve communication between government district managers and Renamo regional commanders and to discuss ways of increasing humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International observers are concerned that the eruption of violence inAngola, another former Portuguese colony, following a 16-month cease-fire, could undermine peace efforts in Mozambique. The United Nations special envoy to Mozambique, Aldo Ajello, has requested a UN peacekeeping force to join the more than 82,000 government and Renamo troops already under UN supervision.  Currently, the world body has assigned 25 monitors and 20 soldiers to aid in the southern African country's transition process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">387 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The American publishing company, Little Brown, is having major problems capitalizing on what it had hoped would be the publishing coup of the decade: the autobiography of South Africa's Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Little Brown outbid the rest of the publishing world in the scramble for Mandela's story in May 1990, three months after his release from prison.  Although the company refused to confirm the figure, it is believed to have paid the ANC president about $3 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book had been due for publication this year, but the company has now signed a ghost-writing deal with an American journalist in an embarrassed attempt to get the project completed by the end of 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially there were moves to get Nobel laureate Nadine Gordimer to write the book, but this idea was shot down -- reportedly by some in the ANC who are said to have objected to a white South African doing the job, no matter what her international standing. The project was then handed over to Professor Es'Kia &quot;Seke&quot; Mphahlele, the 72-year-old South African writer, who has since abandoned the attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now Richard Stengel, a contributing editor at Time magazine and the author of a previous work of non-fiction on South Africa, has signed a contract to complete the book. Again details of the deal are secret, but he is believed to have been paid in the region of $300,000 -- a sum which reflects the growing anxiety of Little Brown to recover their original investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stengel has put on hold a definitive social history of the American sneaker, or casual shoe, while he completes the Mandela project. He had to be &quot;cleared&quot; by the ANC as a suitable author before Little Brown could sign him up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the problem with the project is that Mandela's prison diaries,which were to have been the basis of the book, apparently end in the 1960s, leaving the last quarter century of his life uncovered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eighty-five members of Congress have proposed &quot;budget-saving measthat include the elimination of the House Select Committee on Hunger. The eight-year-old committee was formed to address domestic and international humanitarian issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Led by the late Mickey Leland from 1984 until his death in 1989, the bipartisan committee was labeled the &quot;conscience of Congress&quot; by the New York Times. This year, chaired by Congressman Tony Hall (D-OH), the committee has worked to focus U.S. attention on the plight of starving Somalis and organized the first humanitarian summit among the nations of the Horn of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal that would eliminate the hunger committee has prompted several advocacy groups to actively lobby Congress for the committee's survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> InterAction, a broadly based coalition of 143 private and voluntary organizations working in international development, urged its members to write letters supporting the committee to their state representatives before the reform proposal comes to a vote during the 103rd session of Congress.  InterAction argues that the committee does important work on a budget less than that of one congressional office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the last four years, the Coalition for a Select Committee on Hunger has worked to keep the hunger committee alive. The coalition, which unites over 400 organizations, such as the Salvation Army, the Children's Defense Fund and Unicef, says that the initiatives undertaken by the hunger committee have been effective in saving millions of lives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC official cited new revelations pointing to government complicity in fomenting violence in black townships. He asked for UN help in curbing covert police and army activity, and in &quot;disarming and confining to barracks all special forces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki said the election of an interim government and an assembly charged with writing a new South African constitution would mark a historic turning point. For the first time in 44 years, he said, the United Nations could take the issue of apartheid off its agenda and replace it with an item on the &quot;democratic transformation of South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki and a score of other top ANC leaders were in New York for a conference sponsored by anti-apartheid organizations to discuss how to support South Africa's transition to majority rule. Nearly 1,000 people attended a series of plenaries and workshop sessions at Riverside Church on topics such as education, health, housing, legal rights and foreign investment in the post-apartheid era.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We went to one voting station where everything seemed to be goinsmoothly, except that the polling booth had been placed upside down,&quot; says Ed Brown, election observer for the Carter Center of Emory University, and former executive director of Atlanta's Voter Education Project. When Brown's team pointed out the inversion, an official for Ghana's presidential election told them in no uncertain terms that the booth was fine the way it was, and that officials didn't want to appear to invalidate the ballots of those who had voted earlier by making changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Voting observation can be a series of vignettes like Brown's -- gleanings from small samples of balloting stations from which broad generalizations about the nature of an election must be made. But observer missions are becoming an increasingly important medium for Western involvement in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Ghana's November 3 presidential vote -- the country's first in 13 years -- Canada, the European Community, the Commonwealth of Nations and Atlanta's Carter Center sent delegations who worked with Ghanaian monitors and volunteers from local diplomatic missions to observe the balloting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's becoming routine to send international observers to elections, and yet for many African countries, the election process itself is new enough to make the assistance we provide valuable,&quot; says Paul McDermott, director of the Carter Center's Liberia Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard Joseph, head of the center's African Governance Program, argues that such observer missions can be a particularly useful allocation of development aid. &quot;Elections really are a way of getting governments that are unable to make progress in, say, economic and social areas, to tackle the things that are holding them back within their political systems,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observer missions can range in size from Canada's four-person team, which included three provincial election officials and a Montreal lawyer, to the larger delegations fielded by the Carter Center and the Commonwealth. The Center flew in an 18-member delegation from the United States, assembled a further six-person secretariat, and helped to train a group of 150 local observers. The U.S. Agency for International Development largely funded the Carter Center mission, which included professors, social workers and elected officials. The Ghana mission is the largest yet from an organization that is making election observation one of its major interests. &quot;We've started a trajectory of increasing involvement in the continent,&quot; says Joseph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Commonwealth (formerly known as the British Commonwealth) sent a team of 15 politicians and bureaucrats, who were assisted by a nine-member group from the Commonwealth Secretariat. &quot;We are not supervising the elections and are not in a position to ensure that things go well in every polling station,&quot; says Sir Ellis Clarks, former president of Trinidad and Tobago and leader of the delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the large number of polling places and the short amount of time to visit them, election monitoring has become as much a matter of presence as of observation. &quot;We are here to let everyone know -- the parties, the government, the electoral officials and the international community -- that there is an impartial body observing the scene, one that will state whether it felt that the elections were free and fair,&quot; Joseph told Ghanaians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the observers describe that task, which posted one foreign observer for every 200,000 or so Ghanaians, as a particularly challenging one.  &quot;Election observation is a tough job. While it's easy to see if there's a long line at the polling station, it's not so easy to see if people are being subtly intimidated or wrongly turned away,&quot; says Carter Center observer Bob Wilson, a former district attorney in Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Commonwealth statement on the elections expressed concern with the&quot;shortcomings apparent to us as we observed proceedings in all the regions. In the main, these centered on the admitted imperfections of the voters roll and the organization and conduct of some polling stations.&quot; Nonetheless, Sir Ellis ultimately pronounced the elections to be &quot;free and fair, and free from fear,&quot; while the Carter Center observers decided that the process was not so much rigged as beset by logistical difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Americans, for example, have the facilities to identify anyone from abirth certificate, a driver's license or even social security, credit card, banking and insurance information. For us, identification for elections is easy, but Ghanaians just don't have all of those records,&quot; says Wilson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many observers marveled at the long waits and the hardships Ghanaians were willing to endure in order to cast their vote. Sir Ellis commented on the long lines at the polling booths, lines that McDermott compared with those he saw at a Grateful Dead concert. Carter Center observer Donald Rothschild, a visiting Africanist at the Brookings Institution, says that he was struck &quot;by those people waiting in the hot sun. They really wanted to participate in the democratic process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some veteran observers were particularly affected by the elections in Ghana, with its old slaving forts and legacy of Kwame Nkrumah's Pan-Africanism. &quot;This place has tremendous significance and symbolism attached to it,&quot; Ed Brown says. &quot;It is one of the historical touchstones for black people all over the world. I am especially happy to be in this place to help it reclaim the great potential it has and the great expectation we have for it.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans are voting in record numbers, in a pro-democracy push thhas already forced more than two dozen authoritarian leaders to share power or leave office. When Pascal Lissouba was elected in Congo last August, he became the sixth African opposition leader in two years to win a presidential vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidential, legislative and local balloting is taking place in country after country across the continent in what has been described as Africa's second independence, three decades after the rupture from European colonial rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like Africa's first break with the past, these latest transitions havenot been easy. Sometimes they have fallen short of popular dreams; other times they have become bloody. But the first fragile democracy campaigns have spread, inspiring the entire continent and giving Africans the hope of futures where choice and tolerance are routine elements of political life.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans are finding that pressing for elections -- or even holding them -- is only one battle in a long campaign for democracy.Current developments in West Africa highlight the challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Nigeria, President Ibrahim Babangida is imploring his citizenry to retain confidence in the democratic process, despite his announcement of a delay in presidential elections from December until next June. The rescheduling had been expected, since the ruling military council decided in October to set aside the results of September primaries. Those countrywide presidential votes have been criticized widely as fraudulent, although legislators elected in July balloting will take their seats in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Nigerians blame Babangida's regime for the problems in the transition process. The military leaders have micro-managed electoral arrangements -- establishing two political parties and banning all others, placing restrictions on candidates, and redrawing state borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision to delay the handover to a civilian president has been criticized by a prominent former military leader, General Olusegun Obasanjo, who supervised the country's last transfer from a military to an elected civilian government in 1979. &quot;Principle has been abandoned for expediency,&quot; Obasanjo said in a nine-page letter to Baban-gida, his former aide. &quot;The result is the crisis we now face,&quot; the former head of state said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Babangida has disqualified the 73 candidates who ran in September primaries, and he has dismissed the leaders of both political parties. A new process for selecting candidates has been devised focusing on the country's 31 states. Inauguration of an elected civilian president is now set for August 29, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, in Ghana the first presidential election in 13 years has precipitated a major political crisis. Albert Adu Boahen, a history professor who offered himself as an alternate to the country's socialist and military-led past, hoping to do well enough in the first round of voting to force a runoff with Flt. Lt. Jerry Rawlings, Ghana's military ruler for the past 11 years. But Rawlings shocked many Ghanaian intellectuals by soundly beating his four opposition contenders with 58% of the vote, compared to Adu Boahen's 30%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rawlings introduced economic reforms that have made his country popular with Western lending institutions. While the economic austerity program has sometimes pinched pocketbooks, especially in urban areas, the government also pursued policies to deliver services to destitute, long-neglected rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under his leadership, Ghana has enjoyed five percent growth and inflation has dropped from 100% to 15%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The cocoa farmer in the village sees that he has roads where he didn't have roads ten years ago, that he has electricity where he didn't have electricity ten years ago,&quot; says K. Afari-Gyan, an official with the Interim National Electoral Commission. &quot;Talk of human rights (by opposition candidates) holds no meaning&quot; for ordinary Ghanaians, he says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leaders claim the vote was rigged -- although internationalobservers judged it fair despite some disorganization -- and have announced a boycott of December parliamentary polls. A transition to civilian rule is scheduled for January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The planned boycott has led to heightened tensions and outbreaks of politically connected violence. The worst incident was a clash between contending groups in the northern provincial city of Tamale in mid-November, when some 40 people were wounded by gunshots and arrows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition could reconsider its boycott stance if Rawlings indicates a willingness to adopt some of the measures the parties are advocating, including a new voters registry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outcome of national voting in Cameroon is even more controversial than in Ghana. Opposition leaders claim that the government of President Paul Biya rigged the October 11 vote, and international observers have agreed that the elections were fraught with irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biya has imposed a state of emergency on the Northwest province, the opposition's stronghold, following post-election violence that left at least ten people dead. Opposition leader John Fru Ndi, Biya's leading challenger, was placed under house arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fru Ndi's party has petitioned the Cameroon Supreme Court to annul theelection results, although the court ruled earlier that it could take no action or reports of irregularities. South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, recently visited Cameroon for talks with the president and Fru Ndi, in an effort to mediate the crisis.  *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Address by Zambian President Frederick J.T. Chiluba, accepting thHoughton Star Crystal Annual Achievement Award of the African-American Institute in New York on November 12. Chiluba, a trade union leader, was elected a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1960s probably represent Africa's &quot;Golden Decade.&quot; All over Africathe people danced as one colonial power after another lost its hold on African colonies. After so many years of very sluggish economic growth in the colonial era, the people of Africa now had an opportunity to shape their own destiny.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In that Golden Decade, few African countries needed food aid from outside. Much of Africa was able to feed itself, and in some instances, even surplus food for export could be realized. Our countries' balance of payment profiles were consistently positive. Our foreign currency reserves were reasonable and our foreign debt negligible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was during the decade of the 1970s that the sad story of Africa began to unfold. Something went wrong along the way. The promise of the 1960s was slowly turning into a nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Governments presiding over multiparty democracies soon enough convinced themselves of the need to become one-party collectives. Other political parties were proscribed; dissenting views became treasonable. Private ownership of property was proscribed, and large sections of the economy were placed under government control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the next two decades, Africa was to fall under the spell of one-party dictatorships. In their (own) honor, most of our African politicians built sky-high political monuments, and the citizens were reduced to cheering crowds bent on bare knees and feet, singing praises to their leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Civil wars, military insurrections and coups d'etat traversed almost the entire face of the continent. It became fashionable to plant land mines but not grain with which to feed the people. African governments raised their prison walls and behind them hid the brains and hands needed to take Africa out of its misery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the Africa of the 1970s. If the seventies and eighties represent the decades of the African dictatorships, the nineties will in my view be the decade of democracy and freedom in Africa. Africa is now realizing that one-party dictatorships, with their propensity for economic mismanagement, command economic policies and institutionalized inefficiency resulted in economic stagnation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The future is certainly promising. The people of Africa now demand governments that will demonstrate a commitment to their people. They demand governments that will have faith in the wisdom of the citizens. They want governments that will implement policies with achievable goals. They want governments that will treat their citizens as the official arbiters of the success or failure of policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My government is part of the new African dream. We are endeavoring to create conditions that will encourage efficiency in the political and economic life of our people. We are implementing economic policies that will turn the economy from a perpetual state of stagnation to one of growth. We have removed subsidies and price controls in order to allow market forces to take control of the economy. We believe, of the many things a government can legitimately do, the running of business is not one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have worked out attractive investment terms for both local and foreign investors that will guarantee private individuals a real stake in the economy of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our efforts are bearing fruits. Within the one year we have been in office, we have seen a gradual turnaround in the performance of the economy.  When we assumed office in October 1991, the rate of inflation was 400% on an annualized basis. One year later, with the policies we have implemented, inflation has come down to 80% per annum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have gone a long way toward our objective to balance the budget within two years of assuming office. This is the goal we intend to achieve. Our efforts, as you know, have been considerably slowed down by the worst drought in living memory that has swept the southern Africa subcontinent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year alone, Zambia requires $320 million worth of grain to cover the shortfall created by the drought. We faced a major catastrophe. We are grateful to many of our friends in the international community who responded with uncharacteristic speed to our plea for assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many nations, notably the United States of America, acted swiftly in mobilizing drought relief for my country. We are grateful to the American people. We are grateful to the American government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia is not yet out of the woods. Zambia almost entirely relies on hydropower. Lower levels in our power-generating rivers have forced us to introduce power rationing that has affected industrial production and growth.  Our traditional water sources have dried up. Humans and livestock have to travel long distances to sources of drinking water. For us, drought has been devastating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While we know that the responsibility to develop Zambia and improve the conditions of living of our people lies squarely on the Zambian people themselves, we are aware that there are factors crucial to the success of this process over which we have no control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, no economy in the world can boast of total independence. We need the active and meaningful support of the international community while we slowly marshal internal resources for productive investment to enable sustainable growth and greater self-sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa should be assisted to develop, not as an act of international benevolence, but because any growth in the African economy will impact positively on the global economy. The more African economies grow, the less external aid they will require and the bigger the market they will provide to the international economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's fragile democracy will have to deliver economically. Our people correctly link the efficacy of any government system to its ability to provide food, shelter and clothing. If democracy is to grow in Africa, African economies must be supported to achieve sustainable economic growth.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Address to the nation by Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida on November 17, announcing that the Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) had decided to postpone the handover to a civilian governement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commitment of this administration to January 2, 1993 as the date of handing over to an elected president is one which this administration has pursued diligently. Specifically, it is a date which members of the armed forces and I are committed to for the handing over of power to an elected president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fellow Nigerians, it is now no longer news that the events which preceded the decision to postpone elections constitute a setback to the transition program and pose a serious dilemma to me, not only as a person, but also as a general and officer of the Nigerian Army and president, commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Nigeria. Other bodies involved in the transition are not spared this dilemma -- the military as the mid-wife of the transition program; the entire government whose one arm -- the legislature -- is already constituted and awaiting to be inaugurated by the second elective arm to serve as a complement to it; and other agencies of government charged with the major responsibilities of the transition program. No less in dilemma are our countrymen and women who look forward to that date, January 2, 1993, when our country was to commence the full stage of the transition program and join other democratic nations around the world! This dilemma and problems have raised the single most critical issue of governance, namely: credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fellow citizens, let us reflect a little while on the crisis we have had to face since 1985. The administration has had to cope with two attempted coups -- one of which but for Allah's protection, could have taken many lives and caused disintegration of our dear country, all in the name of wanting to introduce a new social order. Let me also further remind you that this administration has had to face the greatest religious crisis and the greatest communal riots in our history, ostensibly engineered and orchestrated by those who have no faith in the transition program and in the democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The riots are still fresh in our memories. Seditious publications weremade against this administration and its key actors, with a view to inciting the public against us. But we are fully resolved that we can not abandon our duties. I want to assure you that this administration will not stay a day longer than necessary. We will strive to see the nation out of this circle of despair, fear and despondency. Our country deserves the best. And we will not abandon you unless we are able to install or guarantee the installation of a stable democratic orderI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When this administration came to power, the quest for justice and the need for a balanced federal system had to be faced once and for all 11 additional states and more local government areas. What do we have today? We now have a system of 30 states and 589 local government areas and four area councils of the Federal Capital Territory. You will agree that this is one of the boldest attempts in history. We have now reached the stage in our country where all ethnic groups can now boast of a &quot;home&quot; -- state, local government or ward -- which they can call their own, and which they can use as a launching pad in the politics of national leadership. States and local government areas, and not ethnic or religious groups, can then constitute the correct units of representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I want to stress that this administration wants to be remembered as one which had the rarest opportunity to serve our country, and handed over the reins of government in an orderly fashion to an elected visionary president.  More importantly, we want to be remembered as those who left behind a stable democratic order where no one is oppressed, and where everyone and every group is guaranteed the freedom to aspire to any political post in the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having considered the necessary political activities that must take place before the presidential elections with the shortest possible time frame assigned to each of these activities, the AFRC has slated the presidential elections for June 12, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to facilitate a speedy and smooth changeover from the military to fully democratized civilian rule the present council of ministers (the cabinet) will be dissolved on January 2, 1993, and in its place a transitional council which shall consist of a chairman and some prominent Nigerians, shall be established. The functions of the transitional council shall include the completion of projects already commended by this administration and ensuring the smooth handing-over process from the present administration to the incoming one. The chairman and members of the transitional council shall not be involved in political activities throughout the transition period , and shall not hold any political appointment of the incoming civilian administration for a period of 12 months from the end of transition. The chairman of the transitional council shall be a civilian who shall preside over the meetings of the transitional council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having come this far, we must not now bequeath chaos to our people andleave the nation in disarray. As for credibility, sincerity and good conscience, let it be known that neither I nor my colleagues cherish or harbor any &quot;hidden agenda.&quot; Rather, we seek an enduring credibility that will be borne out of a stable and durable republic. That shall forever remain our goal. And we need your support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Islamic Front, a close ally of the current military governmenSudan, began its attack on women as early as 1954. It was then that the Sudanese Women's Union (SWU) was campaigning for women to be allowed to vote and sit in parliament. The Front responded by launching a fierce attack on this campaign in the Mosques. The women's demands, it declared, violated Islamic principles and were contrary to Sudanese traditions and values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when the SWU finally won these rights for women in 1965, the Frontswallowed its opposition. It came begging for the votes of women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This contradiction in the Front's stand -- first opposing women's rights and then exploiting these rights after they had been won -- revealed its dishonest use of Islam. It sacrificed what it had described as Islamic principles in order to achieve its political aims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1983, Islamic frontists became formal partners in the dictatorial government of Gen. Gaafar Muhammad Nimeri. Their leader, Hassan El Turabi became Nimeri's deputy. Together they introduced Sharia, or Islamic law, to Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women were the first to suffer from these laws. Under the new code, itwas possible for a woman seen in public with a man not from her immediate family to be convicted of adultery, even if she were wearing all her clothes.  The maximum penalty for adultery is 80 flogs, a fine of up to 100 Sudanese pounds (about $10) and one year's imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law was abandoned but was followed by another which said all womenhad to wear veils as in Iran, on the grounds that the Sudanese women's traditional dress, the tobe, was not an Islamic dress. According to this new law, women who did not wear veils in public could be flogged. The SWU and other women's organizations campaigned against these new laws with some success. But in November the government issued new decrees restricting women's rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmad El Bashir, who seized power three years ago, claims that under his Islamic Front-aligned government, women have had greater access to the job market. But women have long been present in the judiciary, the police, the armed forces and other professions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, when Bashir came to power, women were sacked by the hundreds,including the first female judge, Ihsan Fakhri. The police refused to promote women, such as officer, Asia Adam, on the grounds that women did not have the right to occupy senior positions, despite the fact that they were capable policewomen who deserved promotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question one must ask is this: Is this the true reflection of Islam's attitude to women?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The answer is definitely no. Careful analysis and study of Islam from its original sources -- the Koran and the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad -- demonstrates that Islam does not discriminate against women, nor does it stop them from going out to work or from dealing in politics. It does not favor one sex over the other. Moreover, Islam clearly objects to the practice of polygamy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is clear that all the laws that have been enacted in Sudan in the name of Islam are far from being related to Islam. In fact, Islam is being used as a means to achieve certain political aims. Ultra-right-wing parties and organizations are using religion as a means to seize the reins of power in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People within such groups are exploiting the high levels of illiteracyin Sudan which leave most people unable to study Islam from its original sources. Extremist groups cheat and exploit the masses in the name of Islam.  Their actions amount to a contradiction of Islamic principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The taking of power by force in the name of Islam constitutes a clear violation of Islamic principles. God reminded the Prophet Muhammad in the Koran that he had no authority over people. His purpose was to inform them of God's message. God forbade his messenger from exercising any power over people in the name of Islam. Moreover, there is a verse in the Koran which clearly states that people are free to choose to become believers or atheists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faith constitutes the spirit and foundation of Islam. This concept of faith is by no means incompatible with democracy. What is incompatible with real democracy and indeed the true principles of Islam, is the determination of extremist groups to use Islam to impose their ideology on Sudan.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1320 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Americans first heard about Liberia's civil war when the recbrutal murder of five American nuns thrust the West African country into the headlines. The five were murdered in territory occupied by Charles Taylor and his rebel group, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), whose attacks on the capital, Monrovia, have ended a tenuous 1990 cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That these latest victims were women, all of them either nurses or teachers, reflects the larger but unreported tragedy that Liberian women and children have suffered during the course of the war. Since fighting began in December 1989, thousands of Liberian women and girls have been raped and killed or forced to witness the torture and murder of others. Those who survived now bear physical and psychological injuries that will take years to heal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During our visits to Liberia in the past two years, we have heard agonizing stories from Liberian women about the war's effect on their lives.  One young woman described how her sister had been tied up, raped and beaten for two days. Today, as a result of nerve damage, both of her hands are paralyzed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside of Monrovia, personnel from a residential school told us that soldiers abducted and raped 25 school girls. A 14-year-old girl was captured and sexually abused for months by a company of soldiers before she escaped, according to a Liberian physician we interviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is natural to want to believe that these are rare and abnormal events. Yet, rape is an all too common accompaniment to conflict for tens of thousands of women. Reports from around the world tell us that in wartime, rape is a daily part of women's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just as the reality of rape in war has been largely ignored by the world community, so has its impact. A 1990 study by two physicians in Uganda found that 100% of the women who had been raped by soldiers continued to suffer from the trauma more than four years after the rape occurred. Over half of the women revealed their rape experience for the first time during the interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the stigma attached to rape, shame and secrecy often silence its victims. From our preliminary work in Liberia, we believe that thousands of women and girls in that country have been victims of sexual coercion and rape. And the knowledge of the vast numbers of women who are attacked can numb public response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the victim's and the world's silence, along with the physical and psychological injuries of rape, that make recovery especially difficult.  Unresolved rape trauma can severely compromise a woman's ability to participate in family life, the community and society. The consequences of rape in war reverberate for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, in Liberia, responses to the problem were being mounted. Before the latest onslaught of violence, several women's organizations were developing programs for victims of rape and other war trauma. The National Women's Commission of Liberia was reaching out to girls who are living on the streets as a consequence of their victimization. Unicef had begun to create materials on the rape trauma of girls and adolescents for use in Liberia's training program for teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But just as these programs were being initiated, intense fighting erupted on the outskirts of Monrovia last month. Even those few efforts at healing have been disrupted as the capital becomes a battleground once more. We have every reason to fear that women are again being raped by soldiers on a daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A major step toward reestablishing the safety and security of women and girls is to support the regional West African effort to end the fighting.  In 1990, the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) sent a regional peacekeeping force to Monrovia, the first of its kind in Africa.  With its force in place, Ecowas negotiated an agreement with the combatants in preparation for national elections. This effort, while flawed by lack of regional consensus about how to implement a cease-fire most effectively, poses the only viable solution to restoring peace in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, Ecowas has shown commendable tenacity and resourcefulness in its commitment to a peaceful Liberia. It has proven that a regional effort is possible, even when the rest of the world appears indifferent to the tragedy of a spiraling conflict. However, if this regional effort is to succeed, the international community must reverse the chronic neglect it has shown to Liberia's plight in the following ways:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali should immediately issue a statement calling for restraint on the part of the warring parties until he can appoint a neutral UN envoy to work on implementing the Ecowas peace plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The UN Security Council should pass international sanctions against the warring factions that are disobeying the November 10 cease-fire called by Ecowas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The Organization of African Unity (OAU) needs to take similar steps. In July, the OAU resolved to &quot;adopt a mechanism for preventing, managing and resolving conflict.&quot; If the OAU is serious about reversing its traditional inaction toward human rights violations in Africa, Liberia should be a starting point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The OAU and the UN should work jointly with Liberians toward apolitical solution to the conflict as Ecowas continues its peace-enforcement role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The United States should continue to support the Ecowas initiative and take a more active role in urging UN involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once the hostilities cease, international humanitarian assistance should be earmarked to restore the Liberian programs to assist women and girls victimized during the war. Particular attention should be given to dealing with the widespread and long-term effects of rape in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The alternative is grim. Escalating fighting and its attendant atrocities will place the physical integrity and safety of all Liberians, particularly women and children, at great risk. The international community cannot continue to ignore the clear violations of internationally accepted conventions governing the protection of women during war. Rape is specifically prohibited in Protocol II to the Geneva Convention. Yet in this century, soldiers have raped hundreds of thousands of women with impunity. Governments, United Nations bodies, human rights organizations and the world community must begin to expose the record and protect women from this crime.  *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the United Nations decided to host an exhibition of photogradepicting the agony of war-ravaged Somalia, organizers had to balance the goal of shocking viewers into responding with the danger of inducing &quot;compassion fatigue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The large color photos that line the UN visitors' lobby are hard to look at.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stark, devastating images of pain, utter desperation and death, mainly in the faces of wraith-like children, assault the senses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All parties to the exhibition -- the sponsor Time Warner, the United Nations and the 23 photojournalists whose work is on display -- are keenly aware that the effect may be overwhelming, engendering a sense of helplessness that causes viewers to turn away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Posted near the images is an acknowledgment of the deep &quot;sympathy and sorrow&quot; the photographs evoke and a strong appeal to turn those sentiments into action. Readily accessible throughout the display are lists of humanitarian groups aiding Somalia, with addresses and brief descriptions of their work.  &quot;These pictures, in their own small way,&quot; says Time Warner President Gerald M.  Levin, &quot;might help move the world community to more concerted action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 50 photographs of &quot;Somalia's Cry&quot; will be on display at the UnitedNations through December 3. On December 7 the exhibition will open at New York City's North Gallery, in the Equitable Building at 787 Seventh Avenue (at 52nd Street), where it will remain through the end of the year. Discussions are underway to take &quot;Somalia's Cry&quot; to other U.S. cities and possibly abroad. For more information, call Sandra Drayton at Life magazine, (212) 522-4884.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(by Reed Kramer * Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Governor Bill Clinton has given the first indication since his election victory that as president he may pay more attention to Africa than his Republican predecessors. Among world leaders with whom he has talked by telephone are three from Africa -- Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and South African President F.W. de Klerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Babangida, Clinton talked briefly about Nigeria's democratic transition and about the West African peacekeeping operation in Liberia, in which Nigeria -- a major oil supplier -- has the leading role. To the two South Africans, the president-elect indicated his desire to see an end to violence and the rapid introduction of majority rule in the country, transition aides say.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former President Jimmy Carter, the last Democrat in the White House, who during his term promoted independence for what is now Zimbabwe and boosted anti-apartheid pressures on South Africa, says high-level attention can make a big difference for Africa right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'd like to see the next administration elevate the consideration given to Africa,&quot; he said in a telephone interview from the Carter Center in Atlanta. With so many African countries moving towards democracy, Carter said, the U.S. government should &quot;expedite and promote&quot; both free elections and the necessary follow-up to insure that democracy takes hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the case of Haiti,&quot; he said, &quot;the international community just walked away after the voting. We don't want that to happen in Zambia and Ghana and other places in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Clinton advisors, there are no plans to appoint any transition team members to work specifically on Africa. The foreign policy briefing papers prepared for the Democratic candidate prior to the election include sections on key African issues. The chief authors of those materials were Michael Clough, former senior Africa analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations, and Walter Carrington, a former U.S. ambassador to Senegal who now serves on the staff of Rep. Mervin Dymally, chairman of the House Africa subcommittee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think Clinton's emphasis on democracy during the campaign suggests he will be sensitive to programs of support for Africa,&quot; Carrington says. In one major address, Clinton criticized President George Bush for failing to back Africa's &quot;fledgling democratic movements&quot; and for refusing to &quot;distance ourselves from corrupt and dictatorial leaders.&quot; Clinton said &quot;the stirrings for democratic reform&quot; in Africa should be actively encouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Carter says he thinks Clinton may be willing to move away from the Euro-centric foreign policies of the past and &quot;escalate overall consideration&quot; for Africa. &quot;We spend a lot more time being concerned about matters in Croatia than we do about Sudan or Mozambique or Somalia or Liberia.  I'd like to see that change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Randall Robinson, executive director of the African-American lobbyTransAfrica, says he fears that Clinton is not yet sensitized to African issues. When asked in one of the presidential debates about U.S. response to suffering in Yugoslavia and Somalia, Clinton responded only about Bosnia, Robinson said during an appearance on the NBC &quot;Today&quot; show's recent specials on Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In late August, Clinton issued a statement decrying &quot;months of neglect&quot; of Somalia and urging &quot;strong support&quot; for United Nations relief efforts. &quot;We must respond to Somalia's relief needs now with the same concern and compassion that we demonstrated during the Ethiopian famine in 1984-85 and towards the Kurds during the winter of 1991,&quot; the Clinton statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During various subsequent campaign appearances after that Clinton mentioned Somalia as a place where the United States was not doing enough. In Raleigh, North Carolina on October 4, Clinton told a questioner that the administration started doing more about Somalia &quot;after we got on them, but we need to do more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clinton also mentioned South Africa in most of his foreign policy pronouncements. &quot;We Americans cannot afford to turn a blind eye to South Africa,&quot; he said in a June statement. &quot;The stakes are too high.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 200-mile (320-kilometer) trek had taken a grim toll. On the outskirts oMundri, a rebel-held town in war-torn southern Sudan, about 1,000 emaciated Dinka refugees struggled through ten-foot-high elephant grass. Many of the men were naked except for chunky armlets of ele-phant ivory above their elbows and copper bracelets fashioned from spent mortar shells. The women urged the exhausted children on by swatting them with leafy branches. Along the way, the travelers ate grass and leaves to survive, quenching their thirst from muddy puddles. They said that they had fled their homes in Bor, a district on the eastern bank of the Nile River, because of raids by their ethnic cousins, the Nuer. The attacks, they said, had left thousands dead and crops burned to the ground. &quot;I have never seen anything like it,&quot; said Koul Malith, one of the Dinka refugees. &quot;If you left Bor now, you would be walking on the bones of the dead.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1983, the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) has been battling the Muslim-led military government in Khartoum, a war that pits better-developed northern Sudan, mostly Islamic and Arab, against the poor south, comprised largely of African Christians and animists. The struggle contributed to a famine in 1988 that caused an estimated 250,000 deaths.  Fifteen months ago, the SPLA split along ethnic lines, turning the Nuer against the Dinka and broadening the already devastating conflict. The Dinka support SPLA founder Col. John Garang, who wants Sudan to be a unified secular state.  The Nuer aligned themselves with a splinter faction that calls for the secession of southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, relief workers say that the nine-year civil war and its destruction of peasant farms is slowly creating a disaster as great as that in Somalia, where two million people are in danger of starving to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The war has forced at least 4.5 million people, or 76% of southern Sudan's population, to flee from their homes in search of food and security in other parts of Sudan or in Ethiopia and Uganda. Hunger and disease have killed a further 500,000, relief workers say. Meanwhile, the distribution of international relief supplies, already hindered by the war between the government and the SPLA, has been further impaired by the factional fighting within the rebel movement. In late September, the relief network suffered a devastating blow when rebels killed three United Nations aid workers and a photojournalist. In response, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali suspended the world body's Operation Lifeline aid program in the eastern equatorial region of southern Sudan until security is restored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aid workers accuse both the Khartoum government and the rebels of obstructing relief efforts. In February, government leaders, citing concern that aid supplies might fall into rebel hands, banned relief flights into southern Sudan by the International Committee of the Red Cross. In May, the government extended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the ban to trucking. UN relief flights are sporadic, depending on the whims of Khartoum officials. To make matters worse, in late September the government announced that it would donate 100,000 tons of surplus sorghum to Somalia and other drought-stricken African countries, ignoring the more than one million southern Sudanese who are at risk of starvation. The message was clear: If Khartoum cannot find a military solution to the war, it will starve the seat of insurrection into submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the SPLA hampers relief efforts by requiring foreign aid workers to acquire visas to enter rebel-held areas and by stealing food earmarked for civilians. The rebels have become progressively less cooperative since May 1991, when their principal supporter, President Mengistu Haile Mariam of neighboring Ethiopia, was overthrown. That deprived the rebels of vital shipments of arms and supplies, leading to the loss of 14 towns to government forces earlier this year. Since June, the Garang faction of the SPLA has been shelling Juba, the largest government-held city in the south. In September, rebels threatened to shoot down any relief planes flying there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Caught in the middle of the fighting are 300,000 civilians, herded into Juba from surrounding villages by government troops for use as a human shield from SPLA attacks. In mid-August, the government expelled all expatriate missionaries from the city, which is now closed to journalists, leaving no foreigners to witness the human rights abuses there. According to the expelled clergymen, soldiers have executed hundreds of alleged SPLA sympathizers, including a Sudanese employee of the U.S. Agency for International Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soldiers have also mined routes out of Juba to prevent their civilian hostages from leaving. According to London-based Amnesty International, troops have burned down heavily populated areas of the city to create free-fire zones. &quot;As a result,&quot; a spokesman for the human rights organization says, &quot;more than 100,000 people are reported to be squatting, many in appalling conditions and without shelter from the seasonal rains.&quot; But those rains are a mixed blessing. When the dry season begins in December, fighting is expected to intensify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western leaders consider the government of Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan El Bashir to be one of the most repressive in the world. After he took power in a 1989 coup, Bashir and Islamic fundamentalist leader Hassan El Turabi, head of the National Islamic Front, embarked on what they call a holy war against southern infidels. Last year, the government imposed Islamic law on the entire country, punishing thievery with amputation of limbs and the drinking of alcohol with public flogging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year, officials ordered southern schools to teach the Koran and Arabic, a language that many Africans in the south do not speak. Bolstered by an infusion of Iranian-supplied arms and Chinese MiG fighter jets, Bashir and Turabi see the capitulation of southern Sudan as the first step in a putsch to Islamicize the rest of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington officials clearly distrust Khartoum government leaders. ButU.S. options appear to be limited: the United States cut off all economic and military aid to Khartoum after the 1989 coup. At the same time, Western nations have been overburdened by relief efforts in Somalia, where worldwide attention has been focused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andrew Natsios, an administrator with the U.S. Agency for International Development, said that a catastrophe of epic proportions looms in Sudan. &quot;It's not like Somalia yet,&quot; said Natsios, &quot;but it may well be at some point.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Believing that more can be done to protect children from the effeof Africa's economic crises, the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) scheduled an international conference on assistance to African children for November 25-27 in Dakar, Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A document prepared for the meeting challenges the world community to recognize Africa's successes and its promise as well as its failures and its problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's Children, Africa's Future says that the image of Africa as acontinent in constant crisis is flawed. &quot;Few regions in the world so quickly made gains in improving the lives of their children as Africa did in its first two decades of independence,&quot; says the report, &quot;despite the fact that in 1960 (Africa) was the world's most economically deprived continent.&quot; African countries raised health, education and other indicators of progress to levels that industrialized nations took more than a century to achieve. During the 1960s and 1970s, life expectancies climbed while infant mortality declined.  Primary school enrollment soared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even amid the natural disasters and economic catastrophes of the 1980s, Africans can cite certain advances. Contrary to the popular image, overall food production in Africa has actually increased since the 1970s, at about the same rate as in other parts of the world. And the continent was able to double the immunization rate of its children, with 22 nations reaching the objective of 75% coverage that health experts regard as virtually equivalent to full protection. That achievement, the report says, which required immense dedication and creativity, illustrates what can be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign to chart a new course for Africa's children is buoyed by the political climate of the last two years, including the burgeoning democracy movements across the continent and the economic reform programs that numerous countries are implementing. The Dakar conference document hails &quot;Africa's determination to push ahead with tough policy reforms even though the major powers, whose support is vital for the success of these reforms, are preoccupied with other, more 'strategic' regions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the advances of the post-independence years have eroded in the last decade, and reversing the current downward trends will be difficult. In many countries, living standards have dropped, school enrollment rates are down, and basic services such as health care are becoming scarcer. Today, African children constitute only 10% of the world's child population, but a third of the 40,000 children who die every day around the world are African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A major obstacle to improving that record are the wars that still range in the spots that were among the hottest battlegrounds of the Cold War: Somalia, Sudan, Mozambique, Angola and Liberia. But even countries that are at peace face major challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The courses of action recommended by Africa's Children include a broadrange of action at the local and regional levels, such as promotion of breast-feeding, making sure that girls have equal access to education with boys, and expanding family planning services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Making contraceptive measures available to all women who want them could yield dramatic results. Although African food production has been rising consistent with world averages, population has risen faster than in other regions, meaning that food production per person has gone down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economic growth will be the linchpin of African progress, the report concludes. But it argues strongly that higher growth rates can be built only on improved health, education and nutrition for Africa's people, particularly its women and children, who are the poorest of the poor.  *</SPAN></P>

But parliamentary balloting gave no party a commanding majority, and a no-confidence vote last month resulted in the ouster of reformist prime minister Stehpane Bongho-Nourra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After lengthy negotiations between Lissouba's supporters and the former ruling party, a power-sharing deal was agreed that will allow Lissouba to name a new prime minister &quot;after consulting with the political parties.&quot; A new round of parliamentary elections will be held later this year, but the unity government will serve until then.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political tensions in Zaire reached the boiling point again early this month when President Mobutu Sese Seko sent troops to oust government ministers from their offices after announcing the dismissal of the Cabinet. Mobutu ordered Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, who was elected prime minister by the National Democracy Conference last August to form a new &quot;government of national unity.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tshisekedi and the long-ruling president have been sparring over control of the country's finances and army and over a timetable for holding the country's first democratic elections in three decades. Mobutu's move was evidently intended to force Tshisekedi to compromise. The president wants elections held quickly, while the prime minister and the National Conference delegates want an 18- to 24-month period to rebuild the country's shattered economy and prepare voter rolls throughout the huge country, Africa's third largest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roman Catholic Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya, the conference chairman, has been mediating between the two men, convening the only three sessions they have held since Tshisekedi became prime minister. The cleric has proved himself a skilled diplomat and is credited by many democracy supporters with having averted a harsher crackdown up to now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leader of the Polisario Front Independence movement in Western Sahara says that recent mass demonstrations against Moroccan occupation of the former Spanish colony have been crushed by Moroccan authorities. Mohammed Abdelaziz says the situation in the former Spanish colony, where a United Nations peacekeeping force is charged with conducting elections, is beginning to reassemble an intifada, or generalized resistance, to Moroccan control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abdelaziz says that the United Nations is failing to protect Saharans from the widespread arrests and torture that typically follow the protests. He is particularly bitter about an incident in October, when several young Saharan demonstrators who had sought asylum in the headquarters of Minurso, the UN monitoring group, were denied refuge and were arrested by Moroccan authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview during his first visit to Britain, the Polisario secretary -general appealed to the United Nations to fulfill its mission of allowing Saharans to exercise a free choice about their future, and he called on the world body to pressure Morocco to allow access to the territory by the international press. He said the presence of journalists and independent observers would offer some protection to Saharans who oppose Moroccan rule in the former Spanish colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are getting reports all the time of horrible tortures,&quot; Abdelaziz says.  &quot;Our people are being thrown from helicopters, blindfolded and handcuffed. They are being buried alive in mass graves. This is a regime the international community must act against.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he says Polisario's cause is hindered by Americans who see Morocco as an exotic vacation spot rather than a police state. While he says Polisario has no objections to Western tourists visiting Morocco, he warns of &quot;good-hearted people being deceived&quot; by the attractive facade that masks a harsh reality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The postponement of a new round of peace talks on Sudan has cast a further shadow over the fate of the threatened population in the south of the country.  Representatives of the government of Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmad El Bashir, was to meet a delegation from the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in Nigeria on December 5.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conditions are worsening rapidly for an estimated 9 million people in the south, where the SPLA is fighting for autonomy from the northern-based regime.  United Nations officials say suffering in parts of southern Sudan is as bad as in Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Announcing the postponement of peace talks, Bashir blamed the delay on conflicts within the SPLA. Two breakaway factions have been formed since an attempt was made in August of 1991 to overthrow SPLA chief John Garang. In November, Bashir invited all SPLA factions to attend the peace talks, but Garang protested, accusing the Sudanese leader of trying to exploit the movement's divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of Sudanese have fled to neighboring Uganda and Kenya to escape the famine and civil strife. International agencies report that close to 4.5 million people have been forced from their homes since the war began in 1983.  The United Nations estimates that as many as 600,000 Sudanese have died as a result of the conflict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael O'Neill, who works for Africare, a Washington, DC-based development group, was captured on October 24 along with a Sierra Leonean colleague in the diamond mining town of Koidu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rebel group called the Revolutionary United Front, led by Foday Sankoh, admitted to abducting O'Neill, who was coordinating Red Cross food relief efforts in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O'Neill says that he was treated well during his captivity and that the kidnapping apparently was a desperate attempt to attract international attention to the situation in rebel-held areas of the country.

Abdesselam says he is determined to destroy the &quot;spider's web&quot; of support for the movement and has vowed to dissolve the local and regional governments and charitable and union groups sympathetic to the &quot;extremists.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The curfew, which applies to the capital, Algiers, and six other regions, requires everyone to stay indoors from 10:30 p.m. until 5:00 a.m., with the exception of medical and other emergency personnel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Libya's leader Muammar Quaddafi has threatened to pull his country out of the United Nations to protest the proposed tightening of UN sanctions. Britain, France and the United States are pushing for the United Nations to strengthen the economic and political boycott, in an effort to force Libya to turn over suspects in the bombings of American and French airliners in 1988 and 1989.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three allies have asked Libya to hand over the six intelligence operatives indicted in the two bombings. A U.S. airliner exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland , killing everyone on board in 1988, and a year later, a French UTA flight was bombed en route to Niger. The UN Security Council earlier this year imposed punitive sanctions on the Libyan government, banning all civilian flights to and from the country, placing an embargo on all arms sales and curtailing diplomatic relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While there has been some talk among the allies of urging the United Nations to adopt an oil embargo against Quaddafi's government, experts believe that is unlikely because of German and Italian dependence on Libyan oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sanctions already have damaged Libya's economy. According to Libyan officials, the measures have cost the country $2.4 billion. Several infrastructural projects have been delayed by a lack of sufficient funds, thousands of civil workers have not been paid for several months and the country's oil industry has fallen behind technologically. As a means of relieving economic stress on the citizenry, Quaddafi has announced a new government &quot;share the wealth&quot; program, which will distribute half of the country's yearly oil income directly to Libyan families in sums of $7,000 to $10,000 a year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The picture of Africa presented by most African art exhibits in the United States is like the picture of America presented by Colonial Williamsburg:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> centuries out of date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rooms filled with traditional masks and other wood carvings, most a century or more old, reflect an Africa that the early Western traders and explorers saw. The art of that era was cataloged and collected by missionaries, colonial administrators and anthropologists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But African art forms continued to develop between the 16th and 19th centuries. An exhibit currently touring the United States allows American audiences to see the next chapters in that evolution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art,&quot; opened November 7 at the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh, after stops earlier this year in Dallas, St.  Louis and Charlotte, NC. It is scheduled to open at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, on February 6 and at the Center for Fine Arts in Miami on May 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exhibit's 130 objects from 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa bring together, for the first time in a major exhibit, diverse types of contemporary African art. The show groups the pieces within five categories: &quot;traditional&quot; art, &quot;urban&quot; or popular art, &quot;new functional&quot; or innovative art, &quot;international&quot; or academic art, and &quot;extinct&quot; art or art that has lost its original function but lives on as a symbol of national or cultural identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exhibit aims to depict Africa's exploration of its relationship to the West, Islam, Christianity and its own artistic heritage in the wake of the continent's contact with Europe, according to the Center for African Art in New York, which put together the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This exhibition challenges two widely held misconceptions about 20th century African art: that its celebrated traditional art belongs to cultures glorious but extinct, dead upon contact with the West, and that there is no modern Africa or African art, merely second-hand Western culture,&quot; writes Susan Vogel, executive director of the Center for African Art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bryna Freyer, curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art, says the show &quot;counteracts the feeling that African art has stopped; that when the colonial era came in people became instantly uncreative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For me and others, this has been a real watershed,&quot; says Mark Leach, curator of contemporary art at the Mint Museum in Charlotte, NC, where over 21,000 people attended &quot;Africa Explores&quot; during August, September and October -- several thousand more than average for an exhibit of this size. &quot;It has really challenged people's conceptions of what African art is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the traditional art in the exhibit is not what museum goers in the United States have come to expect. For example, Ere Ibeji, a cult based in the Yoruba region of Nigeria, traditionally required a family that lost a twin to commission a wooden sculpture of the deceased. But 20th century families have begun to substitute brightly colored twin plastic dolls or photographs with double images of the surviving twin. Such objects, on display in &quot;Africa Explores&quot;, take advantage of modern technology, while allowing Muslims and Christians to distance themselves from traditional religion without completely abandoning its practices, according to the exhibition catalog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the exhibit's displays that startle visitors are a six-foot-long wooden onion painted in green enamel and an equally large wooden chicken and a Mercedes Benz, the creations of Kane Kwei, a Ghanaian coffin maker. The caskets were produced as the final resting places of, respectively, a successful farmer , a respected woman with many children and a wealthy entrepreneur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwei combined the traditional value of honoring the dead with a 20th century arrival in Africa -- the desire to be remembered as an individual -- to devise a fresh art form. The exhibit catalogs such pieces as &quot;new functional,&quot; and the catalog points out that African art, past and present, shares at least one characteristic. It fulfills a function, beyond pure pleasure or decoration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They are extravagantly made and extravagantly decorated for only one purpose:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to bury the dead,&quot; Leach says of the caskets. &quot;We have a tendency in the West to really fetishize things to the extent that we lose the relationship with the object -- we revere things rather than use them. These people are still in touch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A lot of people might suppose Africa is just sort of imitating Western culture,&quot; Vogel says. &quot;It's not. Africa is inventing its own art that is a combination of African ideas and techniques and some Western ideas and techniques.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the &quot;new functional&quot; and &quot;urban&quot; art in &quot;Africa Explores&quot; is so recent that it is still not accepted by the African elites in charge of museums and universities on the continent, says V.Y. Mudimbe of Zaire, who teaches romance languages and comparative literature at Duke University and who wrote part of the exhibit catalog. What is being shown in Charlotte and Pittsburgh might not find its way into museums in Dakar, Kinshasa or Lagos, Mudimbe says.  &quot;The exhibit forces people to think about what is art.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paintings of Cheri Samba, a Zairean &quot;urban&quot; artist with several pieces in &quot;Africa Explores&quot;, reflect the influence of advertisements and comic books rather than an academic school of art. Rather than obscure meanings, the works offer direct messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Lutte Contre Les Moustiques&quot; (Battle Against the Mosquitoes) shows a man with a slingshot and a woman with a bow and arrow back to back in a bedroom fighting against mosquitoes, which carry the parasites that cause malaria. The title is painted on the top of the picture. At the bottom are the couple's words: &quot;Dear, you kill those on the right, while I hit those on the left,&quot; the man says. &quot;I'm doing it my love,&quot; the woman answers. &quot;I have already killed two, but it seems to me that they come back to life.&quot; In text painted below, Samba observes that malaria, commonly called moustiques, is a killer, especially of young children, and seems to be growing more powerful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As his worldwide popularity grows, following a number of exhibits of his work in Europe, Samba appears poised on the verge of another category in the exhibit -- what the catalog calls &quot;international.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the paintings in this category in the show also carry social or political messages, albeit more subtle ones, expressed in styles familiar to American museum goers. &quot;E Onde Esta A Minha Mae, Os Meus Irmaos, E Todos Os Outros?&quot; (Where Are My Mother, My Brother, My Sisters and All the Others?) by Malangatana Valente Ngwenya of Mozambique, depicts a mass of human figures, lost and struggling, as though caught in the country's civil war. The dominant color is blood red.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is much that &quot;Africa Explores&quot; leaves out. Because of their different art traditions, works from Ethiopia and Sudan are not represented. Limited space kept out works from South Africa and other countries. But the exhibit suggests a new way for future scholars as well as museum goers to look at African art in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;'Africa Explores' is not the final statement about contemporary African art,&quot; the catalog cautions. &quot;This is rather the beginning.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following is an excerpt from Memorandum to the President-Elect: Harnessing Process to Purpose, prepared for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Institute for International Economics by a bipartisan panel of former top government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regional and internal threats to peace will be a staple on the world scene in the years ahead. The crises in Somalia and what was once Yugoslavia are likely to be precursors, not exceptions, and as was the case in Desert Storm, multilateral or collective action will be preferable to unilateral American responses. Unless we rely more on collective solutions to military challenges, they are likely not to be dealt with at all.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This commission believes that greater American support for both UN peacekeeping and peacemaking efforts is a national security objective in which policy and a reorganizational effort should move forward together. In his speech to the UN General Assembly on September 21, President Bush made several useful proposals to improve UN peacekeeping capabilities as well as increase the American support to them. But the UN secretary-general has made a series of even more ambitious proposals to which the United States needs to formulate a response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peacekeeping is only one role the United Nations is called upon to undertake. Peacekeepers can maintain a peaceful situation with a military presence, but cannot carry out military operations or bring peace to an area in which fighting is going on, as the world has seen in the former Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For such contingencies, the United Nations must be able to mount collective efforts to enforce peace under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Its members must be prepared to deploy combat-ready troops, to marshal the logistics and intelligence necessary to support them, and to plan for potential deployments in advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without American leadership, there is little likelihood of a significant international commitment in this vital area -- and the long-term costs to the nation and the world in refugee and relief activities and political chaos will increase enormously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This commission recommends that you start a process of enhancing U.S.  support for UN peacekeeping and peacemaking, bringing Congress and American military leaders into the discussions at every stage. We propose the following measures:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Focus and upgrade responsibility for UN and other international peacekeeping/peacemaking efforts at the under-secretary level of both the State Department and the Defense Department. Strengthen the staff capabilities of both departments in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Move the funding for the American contribution to UN peacekeeping efforts from the State budget to Defense. In technical terms, this means moving the costs from the so-called &quot;150 account,&quot; which includes State, to the &quot;050 account,&quot; which funds the Pentagon. While such a funding change is never easy, this commission believes that some form of compromise between the Foreign Affairs Committees and the Armed Services Committees (perhaps joint hearings, as several members of Congress suggested to this commission) would be possible, given the obvious national interests involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Establish a new military command, headed by a three- or four-star officer, to support UN military operations and, if necessary, U.S.  participation in them. This new command would have the responsibility for planning, establishing doctrine, and training U.S. forces that might be used in UN efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Designate one or two U.S.-based brigades for support of UN operations.  The current force structure is easily capable of supporting this additional mission. Should military activity commence, these units would come under the control of the command proposed above. Actually putting such forces under a UN command raises delicate legal and political considerations that must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis with proper congressional approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While our informal discussions with congressional leaders lead this commission to believe that such proposals are within reach, there will be differences within both Congress and the military about the value and details of these proposals. The process can only move forward with strong leadership from you and your secretary of Defense.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Below are excerpts from a 12-page memorandum to President-Elect Bill Clinton from the Joint Ministry in Africa Office of the United Church of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), two Protestant denominations with approximately 3 million members in the United States and Canada. &quot;Our churches have worked in Africa for more than 150 years,&quot; the memorandum says.  &quot;We relate to a broad range of church partners in 13 countries as well as ecumenical agencies all over Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are greatly pained by the current trends of drift and neglect in U.S.  policy toward Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are worried that Africa has been forgotten by the United States and that our foreign policy toward that continent seems to be rudderless and without meaning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is from our faith convictions that we write to you at this time. Our sense of hope tells us that your administration potentially augurs a new beginning in U.S. foreign policy toward Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrival of your administration coincides with a unique period in African history. In many countries, years of dictatorship have given way to broad-based democracies. However, these democracies are fragile, weakened by economic problems and the threatening presence of the military and retired dictators on the sidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, this is also a time of great strife and suffering. In many countries people continue to be repressed and tortured, denied their humanity and economic opportunities. It is a time of truth, which challenges us to show our true colors. Where do we stand with regard to peace, justice and freedom in this world?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What makes 1992 significant is that the Cold War is over. People around Africa are taking on the challenge of building a new democratic order without the shadow of superpower interests hanging over them. Because of the magnitude of Africa's problems, the challenges that people there are taking on require international friendship and assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States has been a superpower player on the African scene for more than 30 years. As a nation, the United States says that it speaks for human rights, democracy and freedom. Do we really believe in these ideals?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our government is the largest contributor to and most influential member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank and therefore bears considerable responsibility for the policies of these bodies.  Our aid and weapons have contributed to the oppression and detention of thousands of South Africans; to civil conflicts in Angola, Liberia, Ethiopia and Somalia resulting in the deaths of more than one million people; and to the current chaos and social explosions in Zaire and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The death toll inflicted on Africans in these conflicts is worse than the combined total of U.S. citizens killed in World Wars I and II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are some things you can do to change the legacies of war, dictators and neglect. In doing these things, you can help bring a new dawn to Africa.  Simply by carrying through on your campaign goals and promises you can do a lot. The costs would not be great but the effects of your actions most certainly would be. Your administration would be investing in peace, democracy and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here are some of our thoughts -- many of which are consistent with your principles -- on what you could do in specific areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Publicly distance the United States from Mobutu, stating in no uncertain terms that his rule is unacceptable in both human rights and democratic terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Work with U.S. friends in Europe and with U.S. banks to freeze Mobutu's assets. The assets were meant for the Zairean people and should only be released when Mobutu is completely out of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Urge the government to release all of the Unita leaders it is holding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Urge both sides to come together for the sake of Angola's people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Upon the release of Unita's leaders, and the beginning of negotiations,recognize the Angolan government and support international reconstruction efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Stop any existing covert funding going to Unita. Resumption of any aid should be for humanitarian reasons only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Investigate rumors of South African government involvement in providing logistical support for Unita military actions. If these rumors are proven true, consider moving to reimpose federal sanctions on South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Support the United Nations presence in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Signal to South Africans that until their country has a fully representative and democratic government that represents the disenfranchised majority, the United States will not support the release of IMF funds for South Africa and will continue to support state and local sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Support the recent call by South African church leaders for the convening of a multiparty conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Support the church leaders' call for an election date of some time in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Consider using the threat of reimposing federal sanctions if the currently stalled negotiations do not move forward toward legitimate rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Support the West African peacekeeping force (Ecomog) and all diplomatic efforts to bring the different sides together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Support the UN ban on weapons sales to all forces except the West African peacekeeping troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Investigate the role that several European companies are playing in funding one of the rebel forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Provide reconstruction funds via the United Nations. The funds would be taken from military accounts and act as compensation for past U.S. policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Consider developing a food for guns strategy in consultation with Ecomog and the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western Sahara:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Use leverage to foster a fair and sovereign solution -- via the United Nations -- to the Western Saharan situation and to make a human rights statement about Morocco, where both Sahrawis and Moroccans languish in prison and endure other hardships for their political beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Work with President Bush, the United Nations and Kenyans to ensure that effective monitoring of the December elections takes place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Closely watch these elections and investigate other international structures that might be placed on the government in the event that the elections are not legitimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Support an adequate UN presence that could help move Mozambique toward a situation more akin to Namibia's peaceful and democratic transition rather than a repeat of the Angolan tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Increase humanitarian assistance to rebuild the poorest country in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Press the South African government to stop South African citizens from providing Renamo rebels with weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Investigate reports that U.S. citizens are supplying Renamo with weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Develop an exchange program designed to provide food for guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Call for an immediate cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Work with the United Nations to pressure the Sudanese government to open up relief routes in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Consider an international financial blockade on the Sudanese government in order to stop the forced relocation of people from Khartoum and the Nuba mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Work with the United Nations to develop a comprehensive humanitarian effort for Sudan. Be prepared to support this effort morally, financially and physically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Continent-wide:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Lead the way in checking the flow of arms and increasing relief supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Invest in people, in education, farmers, land conservation, schools, housing , and local industry to ensure that catastrophes do not repeat themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Support a debt transfer for sub-Saharan countries where these countries would stop paying interest on their debt in foreign currency and instead pay it in local currency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola soon may resume its 16-year-old civil war that has claimed 350,000 lives. On October 31, one month after the country's first democratic elections, heavy fighting erupted in and around Angola's capital of Luanda between the government forces of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and partisans of Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita). Thousands of Angolans were killed in four days of fighting. Since then, MPLA and Unita forces have continued to skirmish in the Angolan countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MPLA reportedly distributed thousands of weapons to its cadres, leading to the massacre of thousands of unarmed civilians suspected of being Unita supporters. Moreover, the MPLA apparently sought to decapitate Unita by killing its vice president, Jeremias Chitunda, and other top Unita leaders. But the MPLA denies responsibility for the outbreak of violence and instead blames Angola's turmoil on an abortive Unita coup d'etat attempt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice President Chitunda and other top Unita leaders were in Luanda at the MPLA's request -- and under UN security guarantees -- to negotiate arrangements for the required presidential runoff between Savimbi and dos Santos. Unita was pressing to remedy election shortcomings, including inadequate Unita access to the mass media, excessive MPLA control over the administration of the election, and the intimidating tactics of the MPLA's 30,000-strong &quot;anti-riot&quot; police force. The government was insisting that Unita withdraw from areas it had occupied since the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month's bloodshed shattered these talks, and Angola now is effectively partitioned. The only hope for peace is if the two parties can negotiate a political solution. Additional fighting or an extended partition would be disastrous for Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States correctly has maintained that democratic elections and an integrated national army are the only way to find peace. The United States also has urged a general cease-fire and the release of several Unita generals who are being held captive by the MPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To help prevent Angola from plunging into renewed civil war, the United States should support Unita's call for an independent investigation of the Luanda massacre. The State Department has said nothing about the Luanda massacre beyond pro forma statements decrying the loss of Angolan life.  Washington's meek neutrality signals acquiescence to the killings, reducing the possibility that Savimbi and dos Santos will renew negotiations soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States should also withhold diplomatic recognition of the MPLA regime. Recognition would reduce the MPLA's incentive to negotiate seriously with Unita and further erode Washington's already diminished influence with Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recognition should be given only to a democratic Angolan government -- in this case, one resulting from a presidential runoff election or a power-sharing deal between the MPLA and Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa, too, may be on the brink of civil war, with the on-again off -again multiparty negotiations for a post-apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If South Africa erupts into full-scale violence, the United States could find itself under tremendous pressure to participate in, or even lead, a United Nations peacekeeping operation there. Participation in such a UN force, similar to the one now in Yugoslavia, would not be in the U.S. national interest. To avoid this predicament, Washington should resist pressuring the South African government into accepting increasing international intervention into its internal affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This intervention to date consists of 65 or so UN-sanctioned peace monitors. Despite their good intentions, the peace monitors actually could encourage more violence in South Africa. Some South African activists using or contemplating violent political tactics probably view the admission of UN and other peace monitors as a &quot;defeat&quot; for the South African government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the potential for increased violence, it is likely that there will be pressure to dispatch more peace monitors to South Africa, regardless of their effect. The mechanism for doing so is in place. UN Security Council Resolution 772, passed last August, authorizes Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to deploy an unspecified number of peace monitors to South Africa. Some Security Council members already have sought to send 400 UN peace monitors to South Africa. All that is needed is the South African government's permission. So far, the South African government has welcomed a &quot;reasonable&quot; number of peace monitors, but not as many as 400.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk is in a weak position to resist demands that South Africa accept additional peace monitors, having already sanctioned an unprecedented intervention in its internal affairs. The United States, however, must not pressure South Africa into accepting more peace monitors. In fact, the United States should even avoid pressuring de Klerk into keeping the current peace monitors if they are unwanted. There are two reasons for this: 1) peace monitors cannot reverse the political dynamics fueling the violence; they may, in fact, be used politically by one side against the others; and 2) if things were to get out of hand, and the UN had to launch a major peacekeeping operation in South Africa, the United States would be pressured to take the lead to finance it and possibly provide military support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To be sure, the United States has interests in South Africa. Washington would like to see a peaceful dismantling of apartheid and a stable transition to democracy. These interests, however, in no way warrant a major U.S.  financial and military commitment to a UN peacekeeping operation.  * Thomas Sheehy is a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An African safari may not be high on Bill Clinton's official travel plans, but it should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not since John F. Kennedy assumed office has a newly elected American president commanded as much hope and respect among Africans as Bill Clinton.  But Kennedy, whom Africans still revere for championing their independence before it was the fashion, never set foot in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Clinton can make amends for that historic oversight. In the process, he could give enormous moral impetus to Africa's emerging democracies and a new generation of leaders who are Clinton's political age-mates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa is a natural part of the next president's international constituency. Although he could easily ignore or downgrade African issues, Clinton has ample reason to take the continent seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans understand Clinton's domestic agenda and do not expect the new administration to increase foreign assistance substantially or pursue an overtly activist role in African affairs. What they do see in Clinton, however, is an American president who can genuinely empathize with their problems and engage them as equals in discussion and resolution of global issues and mutual concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans perceive Clinton as a &quot;man of the people,&quot; someone who is comfortable with human contact, who listens well and seeks to build consensus -- all important aspects of social and political life in Africa. To many Africans, Clinton represents a &quot;new dawn,&quot; a powerful symbol associated originally with the continent's emergence from colonial domination. Today, the image reflects the incipient democratization that is replacing Africa's first generation of post-independence rulers with younger, more pragmatic and better-educated leaders who are prepared to live or die politically by the popular vote.  In his foreign policy campaign speeches, Clinton stressed the importance of helping new democracies, particularly in the former Soviet bloc, to weather transitional turmoil. Africa's democratic rebirth is no less vulnerable. For every Tajikhistan, there is an Angola; for every Yeltsin, a Soglo in Benin or a Chiluba in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans assume that Clinton understands this reality and will act accordingly. They believe that African democracy is inherently as worthy as Russian democracy and that the Clinton administration will take the lead in giving new meaning and substance to African independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Clinton can hardly be expected to appreciate the resonance of his own priorities, governing style and philosophy within a continent that sees such promise in his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is why he should visit Africa during his first year in office. He would meet a new generation of leaders and private citizens who are trying to promote political and human rights reforms, economic liberalization, environmental awareness and acceptance of ethnic diversity. And he would discover that it is in our national self-interest to encourage job creation and productivity in Africa and to strengthen democratic systems and institutions as a buffer against the kind of Balkanization that threatens to destabilize much of the former Soviet Bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of its frequent crises, natural or otherwise, Africa has the potential to be a keystone of stability in a changing world. African nations have embarked on the difficult road to democratic change. They are swallowing the bitter pill of structural economic adjustment. And they have begun to recognize that their survival -- and ours -- may be linked to how well they conserve a fragile environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans need to know that President Clinton cares whether the continent rises from its current miseries or sinks further into conflict and chronic underdevelopment. If he does nothing else for Africa, he needs to pursue his stated support for a strong, international rapid-deployment peacekeeping force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such intervention could have saved thousands of lives -- and millions of dollars in relief funds -- in Somalia, Sudan, Angola, Liberia and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To many Africans, Bill Clinton is the reincarnation of the Kennedy spirit.  Just as JFK embodied Africans' heady expectations at independence in the early 1960s, Clinton represents Africans' aspirations in the 1990s. He owes them the visit Kennedy never made.  * C.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The West African nation of Ghana has achieved economic growth rates that are among Africa's highest and exceed those of many industrial nations, including the United States and Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana's boom began after Jerry Rawlings, a young air force lieutenant, seized power in a 1981 coup. Despite his radical, anti-imperialist rhetoric, Rawlings turned to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for help in turning the country's economy around, after two decades of corruption and mismanagement by previous military and civilian governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six years of growth that have averaged over five percent annually has been cited as a factor in Rawlings' decisive win over four opponents in last month's first presidential election in more than a decade. But Rawling's critics say Ghana's economic achievements are not as impressive as the government and its foreign backers have suggested.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following article by Kwasi Anyemadu, who teaches economics at the University of Ghana, is excerpted from a column published by the Ghanaian Chronicle newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCRA, GHANA - Kwasi Anyemadu The improved performance of the economy during the rule of the PNDC is the regime's proudest achievement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have, indeed, been improvements in the economy in many respects, but the economic situation is not as healthy as government propagandists claim.  Sluggish growth in the agricultural sector is evident, so also is distress in the manufacturing sector. There also have been for some time now considerable strains on the macroeconomy, a fact concealed from the Ghanaian public and the world at large by falsification of economic data, or if you are not given to semantic caution, by plain, brazen lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some reading this article will be impressed by the contradictions inherent in a situation in which a regime, whose leader self-righteously claims that he and his men are the only people of integrity in the land, can be so deficient in candor with respect to matters of such vital importance to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However well placed such moral indignation might be, this is not the main reason I have written this article. The main reason is that, irrespective of whatever short-term, tactical &quot;justifications&quot; there might have been for embarking on this disreputable venture of falsifying data, the efficient management of the economy is now being hampered by the gulf between the published figures and the reality on the ground. As would not be surprising to anybody, the policies which are appropriate are different whether the budget is in surplus, as it is officially claimed, or is in deficit, as is the real case; whether there is an overall balance of payments surplus and addition to reserves, as it is claimed, or whether there is an overall balance of payments deficit and a loss of reserves, as is the case currently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me at this stage say something about the timing of this article. Ever since I became aware of the extent of the data falsification, I have labored under a serious crisis of conscience. Should I expose the falsifications or keep quiet over them and continue to be part of the cover-up? Would the short -term damage to the credibility of the country be outweighed by the undoubted long-term benefits of truth and transparency? During the election campaign, I resisted the temptation, which was sometimes very strong indeed, to speak out because I did not want matters of such national importance to be entangled in the web of partisan contention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The actual timing of this article has been determined, to a large extent, by considerations related to my work at the University of Ghana. I teach a course on the economy of Ghana, and I know I cannot stand in front of my class and describe to my students a fiscal situation different from what is contained in published documents -- national and international -- without seeming incompetent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I do not know when the data falsification or &quot;creative accounting&quot; began.  It is possible that in the eyes of the perpetrators, there was some national interest justification. There were credits from the IMF and other donors to draw down. The release of each (disbursement) was, however, subject to criteria in the area of fiscal performance, money supply, credit, balance of payments, etc. It might have seemed that some creative &quot;management&quot; of the data was justified to ensure the continued flow of the vital foreign exchange inflows.  At any rate, since the advisability of some of the conditionalities was debatable, not abiding by them in reality probably did not do much harm to the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As this data falsification was done from year to year, however, the fiction depicted in the official statistics departed more and more from reality and came to hinder prudent economic management. For instance, in 1991, there was supposed to be an overall balance of payments surplus of $130 million and an addition to the reserves. In reality, however, there was no addition to the reserves but, on the contrary, a draw-down of accumulated reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, the 1992 budget also projected an addition of $140 million to the reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If we had owned up to the true situation at the end of 1991, we could have instituted measures to restrain the demand for foreign exchange. The gap between the real situation and that depicted by the official statistics is even wider with respect to the fiscal situation. Workers and others who demand government expenditures ought to know the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am confident that if the truth is known to the general public and our collaborators in the multilateral financial institutions, it will inspire the same search for solutions that will arrest the situation and ensure that a sound macroeconomic situation is created on the basis of which accelerated growth may be generated.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An ambitious $300 million mining project in the West African nation of Guinea continues to draw fire from environmental groups, who believe it would destroy one of Africa's last remaining rain forests. The venture is expected to produced about nine million tons of high-grade iron ore annually, extracted from Guinea's Nimba Mountain region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The area has been classified a &quot;World Heritage Site&quot; because of its extensive biological diversity, and environmentalists are concerned that the mining operation would endanger several species of rare flora and fauna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Politically, the project is controversial as well, since its viability depends on shipping the iron through Liberian territory controlled by the National Patriotic Front, the Liberian rebel movement headed by Charles Taylor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thirty environmental organizations from 11 countries recently sent the following letter protesting the project to the World Bank. In response, an official in the bank's West and Central Africa Department said the bank believes the project &quot;should not be undertaken until an independent economic and environmental evaluation is complete,&quot; but failed to condemn the venture as the groups are asking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are writing to you to ask that the World Bank express firm opposition to the planned Mount Nimba iron ore project. A decree issued by the government of Guinea on August 6, 1992 which entrusts 540 hectares of Mount Nimba to the international mining consortium Nimco, lends new urgency to the need to take convincing measures for the protection of Mount Nimba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mount Nimba iron ore project, a giant opencast mining operation, will directly and indirectly lead to the irreversible destruction of the Mount Nimba World Heritage Site, one of the world's richest reserves of biodiversity. The mine will also reduce the natural resource base on which the livelihoods of the overwhelming majority of the local population depend. Mining operations will cause the disappearance of parts of two rivers and aggravate water shortages.  The discharges of waste water and other pollution will inevitably move downstream, creating enormous added pressure on the people and the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the project's impact on the mountain peaks is likely to change both local and regional rainfall patterns with unforseeable consequences for the integrity of ecosystems and the production of both food and cash crops not only in Guinea, but also in Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project also merits rejection on economic grounds alone. Aside from 600 unskilled jobs at the mine site which will be created at a staggering environmental cost, financial benefits will be limited to the payment of a small percentage of royalties to the government, which has shown little or no commitment to a sustainable and more equitable approach to development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia, by comparison, seems to receive greater benefits just for providing its railway and port facilities. The tragic irony for Liberia, however, is that the mining project will largely benefit rebel leader Charles Taylor, who controls the railway corridor and port on which the viability of the mine depends. Payments to Charles Taylor from the Mount Nimba mine threaten to further engulf the whole region in armed conflict as Taylor attempts to overthrow the interim government in Monrovia, which is backed by troops from six West African nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concerned about an ecological debacle of giant proportions, the World Bank's involvement so far seems to be limited to using a Japanese technical assistance grant to finance an ongoing environmental data collection in the area. Unfortunately, Guinean government authorities believe that this data collection represents a World Bank-supported environmental assessment. This perception needs to be rectified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much to its credit, the World Bank has stated in clear terms that the preliminary environmental evaluation executed by Nimco in 1990 cannot be considered an adequate environmental assessment and that neither the government of Guinea nor the investors should take a final decision on the project prior to the completion of an extensive environmental assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the most recent developments in Guinea warrant a strong and unambiguous signal from the World Bank, requesting that the government of Guinea suspend the decree at least until a thorough environmental and social impact assessment has been carried out. Otherwise, the World Bank's planned $30 million Natural Resource Management Project for Guinea, which will cover Mount Nimba and all of Guinea's forest region, will be irrelevant and should be canceled. It would merely give the appearance of being a clean-up operation for the massive destruction that will be caused by the mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same is true for a possible Global Environment Facility (GEF) project for Mount Nimba. Should the government of Guinea agree to cancel the mining project , the Guinean environmental organization ASSOANE believes that a well-prepared GEF project could make a substantial contribution to the conservation of the biodiversity of Mount Nimba. The preparation of a possible GEF project would require close consultation with local people to be able to respond directly to local needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mining Mount Nimba and the conservation of the area's unique ecosystems are not compatible. In recognition of this fact, members of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), including the governments of over 50 states, adopted IUCN Resolution 18.51 in 1990, which opposes the mining of Mount Nimba. Mount Nimba was established as a World Heritage Site under the World Heritage Convention, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Especially in the post-Unced context, protecting the integrity of international environmental conventions would be of prime importance. The World Bank, in its role as chairman of the GEF, which for now is the interim financing mechanism for both the biodiversity and climate change conventions, should use its influence to that effect.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Excerpts from a petition being circulated by the Association of Concerned Africa Scholars to students, faculty and professionals associated with African studies in the United States:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We scholars of Africa call upon our colleagues to reject the National Security Education Act of 1991.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have long argued for expanded funding for African studies. Despite Africa's importance to the U.S. and especially to the people of African descent, African studies has received minimal funding by comparison to other world areas.

The disastrous effects of earlier links between scholars and national security agencies and the lengthy record of CIA and military interventions in Africa are well established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Funding from national security agencies threatens the openness of scholarly inquiry and publication, the physical safety of scholars and students overseas, and cooperation between African and U.S. scholars. Many area studies associations, Africa scholars, programs and centers have therefore opposed such funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For all these reasons, we call on:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Our colleagues to express their opposition to NSEA 1991 as formulated and to all proposals for links with and funding from military and intelligence agencies; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* On the Congress to ensure the integrity of African studies by appropriating increased funding through civilian agencies.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC Congress has appropriated $150 million to fund international research at U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> universities, but African scholars say they may reject the support on ethical grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a time of budgetary cutbacks in higher education, the appropriation, established by the National Security Education Act (NSEA), has been welcomed by many university administrators. But the involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon in the new program has alarmed regional specialists, who say that such oversight threatens the integrity and independence of their research. In response to these concerns, Congress passed several amendments to the act in late October, but the changes have failed to satisfy the board of directors of the African Studies Association (ASA), which has decided not to participate in the program unless further changes are made.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NSEA was originally proposed in 1991 by Senator David Boren (D-OK), chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence. His proposal, cosponsored by Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and John Warner (R-VA), was enacted in October 1991, and in mid-1992, $150 million was deposited into the &quot;educational trust fund&quot; that is the centerpiece of the Boren legislation. Although there are still some technical issues to be ironed out, Capitol Hill and Pentagon sources say they expect a pilot program to be up and running by the fall of 1993, the beginning of the next academic year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Boren, the purpose of the NSEA is to make sure that the U.S.  government has a pool of talented and experienced analysts available when U.S.  &quot;national security interests&quot; are threatened in relatively obscure areas of the world. The program will use the funds in three ways: 1) to provide scholarships to undergraduates interested in studying abroad; 2) to fund graduate study at home or abroad; and 3) to fund area studies programs at U.S. universities. Not all countries or regions will qualify for study -- only those that the program's board of directors defines as &quot;critical&quot; to national security.  troubles some members of the academic community are the links between the program and the defense and intelligence agencies of the U.S. government.  According to the latest version of the act, as amended in October, the program will be supervised by a 13-member &quot;National Security Education Board.&quot; The board will be chaired by the secretary of Defense, and will include the secretaries of Commerce, Education and State, as well as the directors of the CIA and the United States Information Service and the chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities. The board also will include six non-governmental representatives appointed by the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The original plan called for day-to-day administration of the program by the Defense Intelligence College, but that was changed in October, due in part to pressure from the academic community. At the moment, the program is administered by an eight-person staff operating out of an office at the Pentagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last spring, three leading representatives of area studies programs in the United States sent a letter to Senator Boren expressing concern that the NSEA might pose a threat to the exercise of academic freedom and the reputation of area studies. The letter, signed by Edmond Keller, ASA president, Barbara Aswad, president of the Middle East Studies Association, and Lars Schoultz, president of the Latin American Studies Association, praised Boren for his attention to international studies but expressed &quot;grave concern&quot; about the role of the CIA and the Defense Intelligence College in the administration of the program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For scholars of our regions, these provisions represent a significant problem , if not outright risk,&quot; the letter said. &quot;Linking university-based research to U.S. national security agencies, even indirectly, will restrict our already narrow research opportunities; it will endanger the physical safety of scholars and our students studying abroad; and it will jeopardize the cooperation and safety of those we study and collaborate with in those regions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to these and other objections, Boren shepherded several NSEA amendments through Congress in late October, reducing the influence of the Defense Department and the CIA in the program. But Africanists say the reforms have not gone far enough. At the annual meeting of the African Studies Association in Seattle last month, the association's board of directors reviewed the situation and decided to reaffirm its opposition to the NSEA as presently conceived. Although the board meeting was held behind closed doors, sources say the board agreed to reject &quot;every penny&quot; of NSEA funding so long as the program remains tied to the CIA and the Defense Department. The ASA board also agreed to authorize the incoming president of the ASA, David Robinson of Michigan State University, to work with other area studies associations to modify the Boren legislation, so that it meets the association's concerns about the links to Defense and the CIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some ASA members believe that the NSEA, while already a legal entity, is still fluid enough to be transformed. There have been no appointments to the NSEA board, and the Clinton administration may find appointees who can allay academic concerns. In addition, Senator Boren will step down as chairman of the Intelligence Committee in January, to be replaced by Senator Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat from Arizona who has shown a personal interest in African affairs.  DeConcini staffers say that the senator has not determined what his position will be on the NSEA issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keller says the ASA board plans to present its concerns to DeConcini and other members of the Intelligence Committee when the next session of Congress begins in January. The ASA also will lobby new members of Congress, in the hope that they will be more open to the views of scholars from outside the government. *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - &quot;Mandela is free but he still can't vote,&quot; says the cover of a brochure distributed by the American Committee on Africa (ACOA), echoing the African National Congress (ANC) leader's appeal to &quot;keep the pressure on&quot; the South African regime. But as Pretoria and the ANC engage in negotiations on a transition to majority rule, the anti-apartheid movement in this country is redefining its role. What will be the priorities, activists are asking, when Mandela not only votes, but heads a government?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ongoing vitality of the anti-apartheid movement was demonstrated this fall during a large and lively New York conference &quot;in support of the ANC and other democratic forces&quot; in South Africa. Also evident, however, was a sense of unease, as activists debated the relevance of their work in a complex new era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast to past meetings focusing on sanctions, lobbying, protests and boycotts, the New York conference was devoted to the tasks confronting an ANC &quot;government-in-waiting.&quot; This time, some of the key issues were housing, education, a new legal system, health care and post-sanctions economic investment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC International Affairs Director Thabo Mbeki cautions that Pretoria's stonewalling on elections might ultimately require U.S. activists to &quot;go back to the South African Embassy,&quot; a reference to the highly visible protests and mass arrests of the 1980s, organized by the Washington, DC-based group TransAfrica and the Free South Africa Movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the ANC's main message to supporters is its pressing need for practical help and expertise in building a post-apartheid society. &quot;The government has its foreign think tanks and advisers,&quot; observes ANC representative Victor Mashabela, &quot;and we need them as well. We're asking our longtime friends to help us find people with the necessary skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some veteran anti-apartheid campaigners say they feel shunted by the ANC's evolving agenda and are disquieted by the movement's consultations with establishment political figures and major U.S. corporations about future investment opportunities. They also express concern about the South African group's priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is pressure from the ANC, says one prominent activist, for the U.S.  movement to &quot;get off the backs of the corporations and stop alienating potential investors.&quot; The ANC is sending &quot;mixed messages,&quot; he argues, about the ongoing value of sanctions, leaving U.S. advocates out on a limb. Another longtime anti-apartheid lobbyist says the ANC is disregarding advice from the &quot;progressive development community&quot; and opting instead for traditional World Bank economic formulas. Activists also express confusion at the prospect of supporting the ANC when it sheds its role as a hounded liberation movement and takes the reigns of an elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite such concerns, most veteran activists appear to be committed to continuing work on South African issues. With the issues less clear-cut, &quot;this is the most difficult, but most important time to keep the pressure on South Africa,&quot; says Jim Cason, associate director of the ACOA, the oldest of the major U.S. anti-apartheid organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cason cites the continuing political violence in South Africa, the formidable obstacles to genuine democratization and an ongoing need to monitor the role of U.S. corporations in South Africa. Although most federal economic sanctions were lifted by the Bush administration in 1991, over half the states and some 100 cities maintain restrictions or prohibitions on business dealing with firms involved in South Africa. These will likely remain in force, at the ANC's request, Cason says, until a nonracial government takes power in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The job for the 1990s, according to many activists, is recasting the goals of the solidarity movement. &quot;We organized for independence in Southern Africa, to free Mandela and end apartheid,&quot; says Roberta Washington, a long-time member of the Mozambique Solidarity Network. &quot;As those things finally occur, many people think their work is done. We have to look instead at our underlying goals -- helping to build new societies that bring a better life for the people of Southern Africa. That hasn't been achieved yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, a New York architect who has worked in Mozambique, led a session on &quot;Housing, Community Planning and Infrastructure&quot; at the conference.  She says the most productive form of solidarity work may be to offer expertise and material aid. A good model, she adds, is a project that brings Mozambican doctors to New York's Harlem Hospital for training, while U.S. doctors work in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Imani Countess, executive director of the Washington Office on Africa, a church- and trade union-sponsored lobby group, also notes a degree of disorientation in the anti-apartheid ranks. She says, however, that activists need to understand the complexity of the tasks confronting the ANC as it prepares for majority rule. As a future government, she maintains, the ANC would be &quot;irresponsible&quot; if it did not deal with international business and political leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Countess, like Washington, stresses material aid campaigns, Sister City projects, fundraising for South African causes and other grass-roots solidarity work. She also predicts that the Clinton administration will provide more fertile ground for activists to influence U.S. policy towards Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The San Francisco-based Global Exchange, which promotes personal and group ties between Americans and people in developing countries, also plans to stay active on the anti-apartheid front. When the ANC comes to lead a new South African government, says Kevin Danaher, the organization's public education director, many U.S. activists will emphasize ties with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and other popular organizations that constitute &quot;civil society.&quot; It is natural, he notes, for grass-roots movements in this country to support their non-governmental counterparts in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danaher, who has written extensively on anti-apartheid issues, is nonetheless critical of activists who attack the ANC for &quot;selling out&quot; when it seeks corporate investment and consults with the World Bank and other financial institutions. He argues that any future democratic government will need vast resources to cope with the legacy of apartheid and meet popular demands for change. Those possessing the necessary &quot;tens of billions&quot; of dollars, he says, are &quot;the white men in three-piece suits from London, New York and Bonn&quot; as well as the current South African elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anti-apartheid activists who expect the ANC to disdain &quot;tainted&quot; funds, says Danaher, have never witnessed the terrible poverty in countries like South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some anti-apartheid groups, such as the ACOA and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, have responded to changing conditions by preparing to shift from advocating sanctions to monitoring U.S. corporate behavior in South Africa. When the ANC believes conditions for lifting sanctions have been met, these groups say, they will focus on monitoring compliance by multinational corporations with a code of conduct drafted by the ANC and Cosatu. (See box on page 2.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is appealing to anti-apartheid forces to remain active in the new era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need you now more than ever before,&quot; Lindiwe Mabuzo, the ANC's chief U.S. representative, told delegates to the New York conference. Mabuzo acknowledges that her movement has not always maintained adequate links with U.S. activists in the period marked by the ANC's legalization and the start of negotiations. The ANC, she says, must communicate more effectively to its supporters the challenges of marshaling the huge resources and direct aid needed for new priorities like running an election campaign, writing a constitution and building a health care system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The purpose of the anti-apartheid movement, Mabuzo reminded the activists, was never simply to oust the apartheid regime. The goal was to &quot;ensure real democratization&quot; -- a difficult, protracted task that she said would require a strong network of allies abroad in order to succeed.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monrovia, Liberia -The last George Brown saw of his brother and sister was their backs as they fled from rebel gunfire into the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I wanted to follow them, and my ma said, 'No, stay with me,'&quot; says Brown, who did not know his age, but looked 15. Shortly thereafter, the teenager was forced to fight alongside the same rebels who had chased off his brother and sister and his father, a former Liberian army soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;'You wanna join us or you wanna follow your ma?' they asked me, and I said I wanted to follow my ma,&quot; he says. &quot;They asked me: 'You know where your ma go? We killed your ma and if you not join up with us we will kill you.'&quot; Brown, who has been fighting with the National Patriotic Front, led by Charles Taylor, is one of a number of youngsters who recently surrendered to West African troops protecting the capital, Monrovia. They have been taking part in a rebel assault on Monrovia which began in mid-October and say they are fed up with being scared and hungry in the swamps that surround the seaside city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of children like Brown are caught up in Liberia's war -- used and abused, forced into combat, drugged, abandoned and killed. A survey of 518 street children carried out by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) last year found that 17% had witnessed the deaths of their parents. Many have witnessed the slaughter of their entire families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taylor's group is notorious for conscripting boys and girls to fight its guerrilla war. A rival rebel group, the United Liberation Movement (Ulimo) has also brought nine- to 18-year-old children into the fighting ranks, and youths have been part of Liberia's national army as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inside the macabre world of warfare, the children have been forced to take part in ceremonies involving black magic, torture and murder. One 13-year-old had to slit a woman's throat to prove he was man enough to fight, or be killed himself, one social worker who works with children recounted recently. &quot;It's the same woman he sees in his nightmares,&quot; says the social worker, who asks not to be named for fear of becoming a rebel target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maj. Gen. Adetunji Olurin, field commander of the seven-nation West African force, says the involvement of the youngsters is shocking. &quot;We have children of our own, too,&quot; he says. &quot;It is disgusting to see children drugged, walking like robots in the battlefield, firing away into no direction at all and getting killed. That is the result of a madman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia's civil war began in December 1989 when Taylor invaded from Cote d'Ivoire with a small band of rebels. At least 60,000 people died in the first year of fighting. Until the recent offensive, West African troops had kept a two-year-long uneasy peace, while diplomats sought to work out a political resolution. Since the recent attack began, the intervention force has held off the rebels in swamps surrounding the city, but hundreds of civilians have been killed in fighting in the suburbs and in bombing raids by West African aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the war resumed recently, five-year-old Duo decided he wanted to change his name. Still traumatized by the killing he witnessed in 1990, he was afraid soldiers would find him and cut off the one leg he was left with after an army raid on Monrovia's Lutheran church two years ago. About 600 people, including Duo's brother and father, were killed in the attack by Liberian army soldiers. His mother escaped but has left him to the care of the church workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fears of Duo and 24 other children who were crippled by the war, polio or birth defects, were compounded because they could not run from the gunfire that erupted in October. At the Benito Meni Rehabilitation Center where the children lived, one terrified 17-year-old who lost both legs in the Lutheran Church massacre heaved himself out of a wheelchair and hid under a table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Obviously, for a number of the children, they had been there before and it was just like a nightmare coming back,&quot; says Roman Catholic Father Joe Glackin, of Scotland, who works with orphans and former child combatants. &quot;There is complete insecurity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the midst of the fighting, a brave Spanish priest, Justino Izquierdo, rescued the children from the rehabilitation center which was nearby to where five American nuns were killed a few days earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The suffering here is rebounding on children in other ways as well. Relief workers say there have been several cases where hungry adults have befriended street children and brought them to shelters to get an allotment of the rice that is set aside for the youngsters. Other children are abandoned at shelters because parents know they will receive food and medical care there. Some deserted children and orphans live in wrecked cars, storage containers at the port and even dilapidated lottery booths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid the grim tales of abuse and abandonment, Liberian church groups and non -governmental organizations, along with international relief agencies, have implemented several programs to help orphaned children and child soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among them is a new facility that is opening this month by taking in 17 of the youths who recently surrendered to West African troops. The War-Affected Children's home, an old house donated by a Liberian, is being rehabilitated by orphans and former child combatants of the 1990 war, says Esther Guluma, who heads Unicef's education department in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only children under the age of 15 will stay at the home -- this is the age at which children are supposed to receive protection from war by the Geneva Convention -- and the former combatants will be housed as prisoners of war. The yard is surrounded by a huge wall topped with shards of glass and is guarded by West African soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the facility, the children will undergo psychological counseling, learn basic reading and writing skills, and have a program heavy with sports and carpentry. &quot;They will be doing the work (to prepare) for the additional ones that, I'm afraid, will come later,&quot; says Guluma. Up to 150 children are expected to be housed at the home, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Father Glackin says the more the former child soldiers feel they are contributing to society -- after having committed atrocities themselves -- the better chance they have at recovery from trauma and one day leading normal lives. &quot;But it's on such a large scale; that's the scary thing,&quot; he says.  &quot;You're talking about thousands and thousands of children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Len Capozzi, a psychological counselor who has worked with children traumatized by violence in Chicago's housing projects, says rehabilitation of war-affected children is essential to their reintegration into society.  very serious, because if a child is traumatized and cannot get over the trauma and anxiety, it could lead to pathology later in life,&quot; including conduct disorders and social phobias, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roman Catholic Father Joe Brown, who works with former combatants of the 1990 war, says there is hope for young ex-soldiers. &quot;The change in some of them is fantastic,&quot; he says. Many have learned skills such as carpentry and masonry. The more useful they see themselves in society, the less likely they are to relapse into drug use or return to combat, he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Below are excerpts from a document presented to a conference of anti-apartheid activists meeting in November in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Introduction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The apartheid legislative process that governs investment at present is major obstacle to growth and development. In this context, the process of foreign investment needs to be assessed with care.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, the basic International Labor Organization Conventions do not apply across South Africa. Discriminatory practices are widespread, and the lack of transparency in government is hiding corruption and inefficiency and promoting political violence and destabilization. Measures to protect the environment are weak, weakly implemented or non-existent. Investment in such a context will, therefore, not automatically contribute to growth, development or the eradication of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guiding Principles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We therefore propose that any investment after the lifting of the policy of economic sanctions should be guided by the following principles:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Workers' Rights -- Companies should uphold workers' rights including the recognition of representative unions and their rights to bargain collectively, to strike, to picket peacefully; and strike breakers will not be hired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Investment should enhance employment creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Equality of Opportunity -- Companies will eliminate all discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, political opinion or physical handicap and will implement affirmative action programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Environmental Protection -- Investment must incorporate environmentally sound and clean practices and technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Training and Education -- Investment should enhance the productive capacities of South Africans and should, in particular, institute training and adult education programs for workers in consultation with the trade union movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Security of Employment -- Investment should contribute to the security of employment of South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Empower Black Business -- Companies should, where possible, adopt business practices which enhance the development of black business in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Implementation -- Mechanisms should be put in place to evaluate the implementation of the above principles, including the disclosure of relevant information by companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Future Policies of a Democratic Government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is our intention to have the above principles incorporated in the future policies and laws of a democratic government, and these will apply to all investors, domestic or foreign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the interim phase, we will campaign for these principles and will support the further development of codes of conduct along with other democratic formations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conduct will Face Scrutiny by Sanctions Lobby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York- Major U.S. companies are testing the waters for a plunge back into South Africa, despite the ongoing political turmoil there. Although most corporations are waiting for a green light from black South African leaders before actually investing, the corporate consensus seems to be that the time has come to prepare for doing business in the post-apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Companies that pulled out of South Africa in response to demands by anti -apartheid campaigns, and those that never went in, are rushing to confer with the African National Congress (ANC), the country's largest political group, led by Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African-American Business Council, formed by a group of African American entrepreneurs last year during an ANC-endorsed tour of South Africa organized by the African American lobby TransAfrica, is seeking opportunities for cooperative ventures with black South African businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dozens of U.S. corporations that remained in South Africa also are positioning themselves for business in the near future under an ANC-led government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In partnership with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the country's largest labor federation, the ANC has drafted a &quot;code of conduct&quot; to guide corporate practices in South Africa. The draft calls for companies to guarantee fair labor practices such as collective bargaining and the right to strike, mandates equality of employment opportunity and environmental protection, and says that investment should enhance training and business opportunities, particularly for disadvantaged workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed code has sparked a fierce lobbying effort, much like the one that accompanied the battle over sanctions in the 1980s. Some corporations are voicing strong opposition to any guidelines; others are entering into a dialogue with the ANC over the evolving policy; and some of the American groups that fought for sanctions are campaigning in support of the ANC and Cosatu code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate surfaced last month at a forum on &quot;Investment Opportunities in a New South Africa&quot; at the World Trade Center in New York City. The event, attended by several top ANC officials and representatives of dozens of U.S.  corporations, was part of a three-day conference organized by anti-apartheid leaders in the United States to discuss the transition to majority rule.  At the forum, the ANC's Don Mkhwanazi unveiled the draft code, titled the &quot;Platform of Guiding Principles for Investors.&quot; He said the ANC would seek to enshrine the code in law when a new South African government comes to power.  The issue of mandatory compliance -- with the prospect of monitoring mechanisms in the U.S. -- is troubling to some U.S. corporations, who say the ANC may scare off vital investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One leading corporate spokesman, Sal Marzullo, says that by proposing the code , the ANC is sending &quot;mixed signals&quot; to investors about the post-apartheid economic climate. A former Mobil executive, Marzullo heads the Industry Support Unit, which serves 52 U.S. multinationals that have continued to operate in South Africa in defiance of the pressure to withdraw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Why do you need a code of conduct when multinationals behave very well without one?&quot; Marzullo said in an interview. U.S. companies have spent $450 million on housing, education, job training and other social programs in South Africa since 1977, he says, and the cost of doing business there is &quot;already higher than anywhere else in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the programs Marzullo refers to were adopted by U.S. companies aan alternative to pulling out of South Africa when public pressure for sanctions mounted. That corporate strategy grew out of an initiative by Leon Sullivan, an African American pastor and a member of the General Motors board of directors, who promoted a set of &quot;good conduct&quot; principles for American companies involved in South Africa in the early 1980s before he became an advocate of sanctions at the end of the decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marzullo warns that a new code will drive away investment and bring the economy to ruin. &quot;South Africa took centuries to build and could be destroyed in a decade,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William C. Dunning, a vice president of Caltex Petroleum, the largest U.S.  company operating in South Africa, and another leading figure in the Industry Support Unit, is equally blunt. &quot;Business doesn't like government getting into its business,&quot; he says. Caltex, a subsidiary of Chevron and Texaco, which operates a large refinery in Cape Town and about a thousand service stations throughout the country, is also the largest American employer in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunning says the ANC needs to articulate a liberal investment policy that welcomes business and would, for example, enable foreign companies to repatriate 100% of their profits for the first five years. Otherwise, the Caltex executive says, South Africa will lose out to its neighbors, like Zambia, which he says has a &quot;very liberal&quot; investment code, and Namibia and Mozambique, which are actively courting companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Marzullo and Dunning acknowledge that South Africa remains particularly attractive to investors. The country has a prime geographic location, a developed market economy, a &quot;world class&quot; infrastructure, abundant natural resources and a huge potential domestic market. Dunning notes that black consumers now make up more than 50% of the country's buying power, a figure certain to grow in the post-apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some companies, rather than resisting the idea of a code of conduct, are opting to work with the ANC and Cosatu to help shape the guidelines. Apple Computer, which withdrew from South Africa in the mid-1980s, has sent executives to South Africa twice this year and has consulted with Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One initiative that the ANC's Mkhwanazi welcomes as &quot;exciting and progressive&quot; comes from the Executive Leadership Council, an organization of 100 African Americans who are vice presidents in Fortune 500 companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A leader of the group, Honeywell's Mannie Jackson, says U.S. business can either &quot;put its head in the sand, or try to influence what the eventual code of conduct will be.&quot; The council has published its own proposed code, which Jackson says is being reviewed by 150 chief executives, together with each company's senior black employees. &quot;We want to be involved on the front end,&quot; says Jackson, &quot;in specifying future codes of conduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says that as &quot;the first generation of African Americans to invade corporate America,&quot; council members have unique insights to offer, particularly in &quot;avoiding some of the mistakes we made in our own affirmative action days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council's draft code calls on U.S. companies to fund a nationwide Head Start program in South Africa, to prioritize the training of black professionals, to increase black membership on their boards to at least 30% by the year 2000, and to use mainly black suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some anti-apartheid activists are critical of the Executive Council's approach. According to Sister Barbara Ayers, who earlier this year represented church investors at a conference on codes of conduct sponsored by the South African Council of Churches, Jackson's initiative could become a &quot;critical diversion&quot; from ANC and Cosatu efforts to promulgate a universally recognized code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike an earlier draft of the code of conduct prepared by Cosatu that focused exclusively on outside firms, the current ANC/Cosatu version is aimed at &quot;all investors, domestic or foreign.&quot; The latest draft also adds provisions designed to enhance the development of black entrepreneurs, a provision that initially was resisted by the trade unions, whose focus is on labor rights and opportunities for workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Israel Skosana, who heads South Africa's largest black-owned corporation, the National Sorghum Breweries, black business accounts for less than two percent of South Africa's gross domestic product. Skosana says he founded his company -- which uses only black suppliers and has 85% black management -- by going door-to-door in black communities to sell tiny share holdings. There are now 10,000 individual stockholders in National Sorghum Breweries. He calls his company, which employs 4,l00 mainly unionized workers, a &quot;deliberate act of black economic empowerment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking on the World Trade Center panel, Skosana appealed to U.S.  businesses to see National Sorghum as a model for promoting black entrepreneurial expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While many companies react negatively to the prospect of a mandatory investment code, American anti-apartheid groups see the guidelines as a vehicle for continuing to pressure for change. But the activists say they are sensitive to South Africa's need to attract outside investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Richard Knight, research director of the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) in New York, who traveled to South Africa in October for discussions on the code with Cosatu and ANC officials, the guidelines are aimed at preventing abuses, not discouraging investors. South African trade unionists &quot;are not expecting the same wages a company would pay in New York, but they don't want to bring in sweatshop labor,&quot; he says. What they want is &quot;quality investment&quot; in the country, Knight says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Donna Katzin, director of South Africa programs for the New York-based Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which has spearheaded the church -sponsored shareholder campaigns aimed at forcing companies out, says self -interest will lure many companies back. Clear, mutually understood terms for doing business will be an advantage, Katzin says, because they will contribute to limiting conflict and promoting the stability that multinationals view as essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anti-apartheid groups already are exploring ways to ensure corporate compliance with the code. Last summer, the ACOA was instrumental in securing the passage of resolutions supporting &quot;socially responsible investment&quot; in the post-sanctions era by both the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Conference of State Legislatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Action by those groups was seen as significant, because it was city councils and state legislatures that led the moves toward wider anti-apartheid sanctions in the United States during the last decade. Even now, almost 18 months after the Bush administration lifted the restrictive measures against South Africa adopted by Congress in 1986, leaving in place only an arms embargo, 26 states and some 100 cities are heeding the ANC's call to maintain sanctions until a multiracial interim government in installed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But anti-apartheid groups concede that identifying infringements of a new investment code will not be as easy as fingering sanctions violators. The Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington, DC-based corporate monitoring group, says that measuring compliance will be tricky, since the draft proposals are stated as broad, social goals rather than as specific targets for such things as training programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, activist groups hope that the precedent of the successful sanctions campaigns will persuade U.S. companies that their behavior in a new South Africa will be closely scrutinized at home. &quot;We may have to hold their feet to the fire,&quot; says ACOA's Knight, to ensure that corporations adhere to whatever code of conduct is finally adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;South Africa is not just another place where U.S. companies are doing business,&quot; he says. &quot;Because of the whole struggle against apartheid, people in this country have a special place in their hearts for South Africa.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A South African newspaper has published new evidence to support its report, earlier this month, that top government officials ordered the 1985 murders of four political activists in the Eastern Cape region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Nation, a Johannesburg weekly, says it has located and interviewed the official who signed a top secret memo published by the newspaper, and that he has confirmed the authenticity of the document. The memo records a telephone conversation about the killings between Gen. C.P. van der Westhuizen, now chief of staff of Military Intelligence, and a Gen. van Rensburg, a senior member of the State Security Council, a cabinet-level body that no longer exists but that included three people currently serving as government ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest report is part of a series of investigations by South African journalists into the causes of continuing violence in South Africa. The revelations appear to support charges of high-level government complicity in political assassinations as well as in fomenting conflicts which have killed thousands of people in black townships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a March 20 statement, the African National Congress (ANC) and other anti-apartheid groups said the newest information forces them to reconsider their participation in the National Peace Accord, a pact signed last September that was designed to end the violence and establish structures for negotiating a peaceful transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in the townships where bloody assaults and confrontations have become routine, many activists have returned to the old habits of life underground: not spending too much time in one place, sleeping in different locations each night, and trusting only a few people to know their whereabouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most dramatic information on government involvement in the killings has been published by the New Nation, aimed primarily at blacks, and the Weekly Mail, whose readers are mostly white. The two papers have been both competing and collaborating, coming up with scoops in separate probes but sharing information and checking on the credibility of each other's sources.  The result is a continuing parade of exposes, with each journal confirming and then expanding upon revelations published in the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusations come at a time when President F.W. de Klerk had hoped to gain strength from the overwhelming endorsement of his policies of negotiation by an all-white referendum in March. The president, who so far has not been named in the assassination charges, appears to be trying to contain the damage by refocusing attention on the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That tactic, says Cape Town University political scientist William Schrire, is doomed to fail. &quot;The obvious analogy,&quot; Schrire told the Reuters news agency, &quot;is that of a member of the Nazi party trying to establish democracy in Germany and thinking he can escape the legacy of the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of that legacy, according to the New Nation, is the June 1985 memo which records van Rensburg and van der Westhuizen's agreement that prominent community organizer Matthew Goniwe and three colleagues must be &quot;permanently removed from society, as a matter of urgency.&quot; The bodies of the four men were found three weeks later, on June 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After de Klerk questioned the authenticity of the memo, the New Nation tracked down Lt. Lourens du Plessis, who had drafted and signed the document as a record of the two officials' telephone conversation. The memo was sent to the attention of the State Security Council marked &quot;extremely secret.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As bad as conditions were at the time of the 1985 killings, many activists say the situation today is at least as bad and getting steadily worse. A recent report by the Southern Africa Project of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in Washington, DC, says that an average of 45 more people each month are dying in political violence this year, compared to last year. In 1991, sixty political activists, all belonging to the ANC, were killed compared to 21 the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Weekly Mail report says that in the Vaal triangle, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria, at least seven ANC members were killed in April alone. The Vaal Council of Churches has been documenting dozens of instances of kidnappings, murders, harassment and police intimidation of activists and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail also warns that the violence is threatening to spiral out of anyone's ability to control. It says that some former members of the ANC's armed wing have taken advantage of the chaos in the townships by acting as street gangs, collecting levies and imposing protection fees on residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC says the government is pursuing &quot;low intensity warfare,&quot; aimed at weakening the other parties in the negotiations on a future constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional talks stalemated this month over the issue of what percentage of voters could alter a projected interim constitution, which is supposed to be a transition stage between white rule and majority rule. The government says a 75% vote will be necessary in order to protect minority rights. The ANC and its allies accused the government of trying to insure that the interim constitution -- although less than fully democratic -- &quot;would be irremovable except by an excessively high majority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also remains continuing suspicion about the de Klerk government's sincerity in wanting to stop the violence, which some feel give it an excuse to maintain control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current issue of the New Nation reports that the government is working hard for a general amnesty agreement that would enable police and government officials to be absolved of legal guilt for ordering or carrying out violence against dissidents. The Weekly Mail has previously reported that a police constable, sentenced to 18 years for killing activists, has been released after serving 17 months. The paper revealed that four other policemen convicted of political murders have been freed after serving only small portions of their sentences. n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four opposition parties had planned a rally in March to protest 60 deaths that month due to fighting between the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi ethnic groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the opposition cancelled the rally when they were promised one of their members would be named prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismas Nsengiyareme, the leader of the Republican Democratic Movement, was named prime minister April 3rd, by President Juvenal Habyarimana of the National Republican Movement for Development (NRMD), which has ruled as the only legal party since 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 16th, Nsengiyareme named nine members of the ruling party to his cabinet, giving the NRMD the defense, interior, planning and youth posts, and reserving the rest of the posts, including foreign affairs and education, for the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NRMD members held 16 of 17 cabinet posts in the former government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new government is expected to call multiparty elections and to try to reach a peace settlement with a predominately Tutsi rebel movement in the north.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A national conference held in August 1991, had begun the process of stripping power from President Gnassingbe Eyadema, Togo's dictator for the last 24 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Koffigoh was named the country's new prime minister, and a series of elections were scheduled for April 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1991, Eyadema's soldiers arrested Koffigoh.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the appointment of the new cabinet ministers, the April elections have been postponed and a referendum on a new constitution has been set for May 31st. Presidential elections are scheduled for August 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Koffigoh has ordered an investigation into the attack last week on a political rally in the north of the country. Gilchrist Olympio, an opposition leader and son of a former Togolese president, was wounded. Three people were reported killed.</SPAN></P>

More than 100 people were killed early in the year in clashes between government opponents and police before the authorities declared a state of emergency February 9th, arresting about 9,000 FIS supporters and sending about 7,000 without charge to camps in the Sahara Desert. A court officially banned the FIS March 5th.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two thousand returnees arrived (yesterday) from Pochala,&quot; said Chol's March 23rd message. &quot;Many are seriously wounded. They are in very bad condition. Thousands and thousands are still coming. If food is delayed, all the arrivals will die. Please try ways and means through the UN.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks earlier the Sudanese government had banned all UN flights to the refugee-swollen towns of Akobo, Nasir and Waat in southeastern Sudan.  Many of the desperate people Chol saw were triply displaced by the region's shifting wars and had trekked back and forth across the Sudanese/Ethiopian border.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 10th: &quot;Twenty-three people starved yesterday. Everybody is weak and waiting to die. The pastors' wives and others went to Gagwang nine days ago looking for food; they have not returned. We don't know if we will be on radio next week. It depends on God's will. We hope that some will remain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The desperation in those pleas is echoed across the area known as the Horn of Africa. Chol's messages could just as well be the voice of a person in a forced relocation camp in the Sudanese desert, searching for food, water and shelter as the temperature rises; or the voice of a refugee in eastern Ethiopia, stranded in a strange city that relief organizations have abandoned to bandits; or that of a resident of the Somali capital Mogadishu, starving while watching ships loaded with food turn away from port because of shelling between rival militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 23 million people in Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti are at risk from starvation, epidemics and disease, according to the UN Special Emergency Programme for the Horn of Africa (Sepha). Thousands have already died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War and famine have forced more than eight million people in the region from their homes during the last year. More than a million have crossed national borders and at least seven million are on the move within their own countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the flood of refugees has spread to Kenya and as far south as Uganda, countries that are themselves experiencing drought and shortages. By late April, the number of refugees in Kenya had reached 180,000; that number is expected to rise to 340,000 by the end of June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian organizations warn that 1992-93 may be a repeat--or worse--of the 1894-85 famine that killed a million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While lack of rain contributes to the problem, it is the numerous and intractable armed conflicts that have displaced families, disrupted crop production, blocked relief supplies and spawned banditry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, the misery is a Cold War legacy. Although feuds over land and cattle have been commonplace for generations, the deadliness of the current fighting and the widespread anarchy are new, fueled by proxy wars where superpowers vie for influence in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the 1980s, the United States and the Soviet Union poured more than $ 13 billion of military assistance into the Horn, piling up arms and debtsthat will long outlast their own rivalry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complexity of the region's quarrels and the magnitude of events elsewhere have averted world attention from the creeping disaster. &quot;People are talking about it, but there is no material response,&quot; laments Fesseha Tessema, a counselor at Ethiopia's UN mission. &quot;People have to die on the television screen before something happens. After they die, to be on television, that doesn't help them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there is a measure of impatience in newsrooms or policy forums when the subject of famine in the Horn of Africa arises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a certain compassion fatigue which sets in,&quot; says U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Herman Cohen. &quot;Now, of course, we have the southern African drought, which is competing with the Horn on the humanitarian side. There's just not enough money to take care of every tragedy. And it seems to me that the natural disaster tragedies probably have greater priority than man-made. I think people who continue to make war with impunity have to understand that the West cannot just keep on feeding everyone indefinitely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies agree that farmers in the Horn need peace to feed themselves. But relief workers argue that, in the short term, emergency assistance is essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when aid is available, however, successful delivery requires heroic efforts. Relief efforts must contend with shelling of airports, seaports and hospitals, looting of supplies, thefts of vehicles, hijacking of planes and direct military attacks on food convoys and offices. Alain Peters, director of the New York office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, says that at least 15 aid workers have lost their lives in the Horn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in Somalia has become so bad that the International Committee of the Red Cross, for the first time in their history, has hired armed escorts. Relief organizations temporarily withdrew staff from southern Sudan, eastern Ethiopia, northern Somalia and from the Somali capital of Mogadishu in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the countries of the Horn share refugees, they each have unique problems that will need differing solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Somalia, a civil war ended a year and a half ago with the ousting of strongman ruler Mohamed Siad Barre. But instead of shedding their arms, the former dictator's opponents began to fight with each other. While four and a half million Somalis, 60% of the population, go hungry, struggles for power rage across the country. The bloodiest struggle is in the capital, where forces of General Mohamed Aidid Farrah and interim Somali President Ali Mahdi face off across city streets and neighborhoods. The Washington, D.C.-based Africa Watch and Physicians for Human Rights estimate 14,000 people were killed and 27,000 wounded in the capital between November and February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voluntary organizations blame both men for continuing a meaningless conflict. &quot;They have unleased a monster they cannot control,&quot; says Fawzi Guleid, who represents a Somali humanitarian group. &quot;They do not have any clearly stated political agenda or share anything save deep-rooted distrust and personal animosity. They are very capable of prolonging the misery of the people indefinitely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks there has been some wary optimism that international pressure might force the antagonists to settle. UN negotiators have persuaded Aidid and Mahdi, as well as the leaders of factions outside the capital, to respect &quot;zones of peace&quot; within which relief organizations can safely distribute aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 21st, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali announced a 90-day plan of action to provide food, seeds, basic health services and water to the 1.5 million Somalis in the most acute danger of dying, as well as to another 3.5 million with urgent needs. Three days later, the Security Council approved sending 50 unarmed monitors to observe a cease-fire between Aidid and Mahdi. The council postponed endorsing the deployment of 500 soldiers to escort food convoys, although it backed the idea in principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 2nd a UN ship carrying 5,000 tons of wheat docked in the port of Mogadishu and began offloading its grain.  A few days earlier, Red Cross ships landed cargos totaling 12,000 tons,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the supplies are a stop-gap solution to a vast problem, it was the first time in over five months that sizable amounts of food had reached the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The end of a four-month rebellion in Djibouti in March has brought at least a temporary peace in the former French colony, where French troops are monitoring the cease fire. However, government opponents have threatened to renew their fight unless the authorities free political prisoners and make good on their commitment to multiparty elections. About 100,000 in the country are refugees from Somalia and Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One in three people in Sudan will need food aid this year, after droughts and nearly a decade of civil war between the Arabic-speaking Islamic government in Khartoum and black African rebels seeking greater autonomy and power for the largely Christian south of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudan Peoples' Liberation Front (SPLF), which has led the fight against northern domination and the imposition of sharia, the Islamic code of law, has itself split into two factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government offensive against the rebels, coming after floods in 1991, has left 300,000 southerners in desperate need. As many as 4 million people have fled their homes, the U.S. Agency for International Development estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government and both SPLF factions are scheduled to meet for peace talks May 27th in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, according to Siraj H. Yousis, counselor at Sudan's mission to the UN. He said the agenda includes ending the fighting and reaching a political settlement that will keep the south within Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, in recent weeks, there has been increasing speculation in international diplomatic circles that elements of the Sudanese government might be ready to consider the eventual secession of the south. Early this month, according to reports from UPI, the Cairo newspaper Al Alam Al Youm said that Hassan Al Turabi, head of the ruling Sudanese Islamic Front, is discussing such a plan with Western governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all the Horn's countries, Ethiopia and the territory of Eritrea appear to have the greatest chance to break the cycle of famine and war. Rebel forces that overthrew Mengistu Haile Mariam a year ago adopted a national charter that set the country on a two-year path toward democracy. And an interim government is pressing for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Eritrea, which was annexed by former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie in 1962, a referendum on independence is scheduled for April 1993. The Eritrean Peoples' Liberation Front, which is governing during the transition period, has promised multiparty elections if Eritrea becomes a separate state.  The provisional government has set former fighters to work rebuilding the territory's houses, schools, water systems and health centers destroyed by war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, most of Eritrea's 3.2 million people need food aid to avert a famine larger than that of a decade ago, according to the New York-based Women's Committee for Refugee Women and Children. And Ethiopian church leaders warned at an April 1st press conference that millions of refugees, displaced people and ex-soldiers will die without aid to stem starvation and epidemics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leah Leatherbee, director of the Horn of Africa Program of the Fund for Peace in New York, has general praise for the transitional government's respect for human rights. But she warns that if the economy fails to recover quickly, &quot;competition for scarce resources will likely develop along some of the ethnic, religious or social fault lines already visible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a humanitarian summit last month, leaders of Dijbouti, Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea agreed to create &quot;corridors of tranquility&quot; that would ensure the safety of relief workers and the unimpeded distribution of aid. Just prior to the meeting, Congressman Tony Hall of Ohio told the House Africa subcommittee that he was encouraged by the steps being taken. &quot;I am excited about the new role the United States can play,&quot; he said, &quot;not as a 'superpower' but as a 'superpartner' with the nations of the Horn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that to happen, conflicts must be stopped and famine avoided -- a prospect that remains bleak as long as world attention is focused elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. William Lowrey, projects director for the Nairobi, Kenya-based Association of Christian Resource Organizations Serving Sudan, said that as many as 300 people died in the town of Akobo before the Sudanese government lifted its ban on UN relief flights on April 19th. More than half the townspeople are malnourished, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But relief flights are continuing and food and seeds are being delivered. The deaths of thousands in the town, feared by Chol, were prevented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akobo was just one fortunate place that happened to have a radio, Lowrey said. &quot;In a strange twist of events,&quot; he mused, &quot;the voices of Akobo were heard. But the voiceless hundreds of thousands across southern Sudan still feel helpless and unheard. The greatest good that could come from this would be if the cries of Akobo would now draw attention to those in far worse shape who cannot speak and are cut off from all help.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cherish letters from our readers. Address your comments and opinions to: The Editor, Africa News, Box 3851, Durham, NC 27702, USA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I subscribed when I realized that reading AfricaNews informed me about countries I didn't even know existed! I find the mass media (including NPR, though with more exceptions than the rest) focuses on preserving the status quo. I count on you to be a source of information without the propaganda agenda -- left or right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As someone who produces organic food for a living, I particularly value articles like the one on the devastating effects of coffee and chocolate prices on Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have been a subscriber for close to 10 years, and I find AfricaNews to be a very informative publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I belong to several national and worldwide hunger organizations which make solicitations for contributions for countries experiencing drought and hunger. However, these organizations don't go much further than saying there is a crisis situation. And, because some of their newsletters publish quarterly, they are not a source of current information. Sometimes you never learn if the situation ever returned to normal. I guess the situation just &quot;fades away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I always check AfricaNews for current reports on countries that I have learned are experiencing drought, hunger, or starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last two or three years, I have been following civil war and hunger related situations in the Horn of Africa. I believe it was 1989-90, that civil war claimed some 500,000 lives in the Sudan. In late 1990, and early 1991, various organizations were releasing estimates of some 20 million people at risk in the Horn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudan civil war continues. Ethiopian rebels have overthrown their government and Eritrea has won its freedom, but hunger continues in those countries. The political situation in Somalia has exploded, and earlier this year thousands reportedly faced starvation outside of Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Equatorial Guinea, Burundi and Uganda, one-party governments and their dictators suppress all opposition. Disappearances, torture, and brutality are commonplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to see comprehensive and continuing coverage of these situations by AfricaNews in order to keep concerned people informed and, therefore, able to take various actions to alleviate suffering.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On October 21, 1988, a group of African scholars attending the annual meeting of the Financial Management Association (FMA) in New Orleans, Louisiana, launched the African Finance &amp; Economics Association (AFEA). What occasioned the birth of the association was the virtual lack of African issues on the current research agenda of American universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its founding, the association has undertaken several projects.  In 1989, we conducted a symposium on the African debt crisis under the auspices of the Financial Management Association (FMA). In 1990, we organized a special session on &quot;Current Perspectives on African Finance and Economics&quot; under the auspices of the Allied Social Science Association (ASSA). In January 1992, under the auspices of the ASSA, the AFEA held a symposium, &quot;Europe 1992, and its Implications for African Economies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aforementioned activities are just the beginning. A major mission of the AFEA is to harness the expertise of African scholars (i.e., financial analysts and economists) in order to conduct meaningful research on economic, financial and business related issues on African economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will continue to organize symposiums to discuss, in practical terms, issues that are germane to the growth and development of Africa. These symposia are slated for Washington, DC, on September 25, 1992, and Nairobi, Kenya, in August 1993. We have also embarked on the publication of The Journal of African Finance and Economic Development, designed as our association's research arm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The referendum for Western Sahara, sponsored by the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly to end the 17-year-long war in the former Spanish Sahara, is fast becoming a casualty of bad faith, mismanagement, and cynical manipulation.  Originally scheduled to be held last January, the &quot;free and fair referendum&quot; is in danger from reported Moroccan obstruction of the process; from apparent financial and organizational mismanagement within the UN; and from changeover in the leadership in the office of the secretary-general.s</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to the Security Council last January, Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali suggested that if several issues concerning the referendum could be resolved, that he might propose a solution other than a vote.  His report is scheduled to be given to the Security Council at the end of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hearings by the House Subcommittee on Africa and letters from members of the House and the Senate to President Bush and to Secretary of State James Baker to give strong support to a legitimate referendum appear to have had little effect on the White House to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I urge your readers to write President Bush, Secretary of State James Baker, and Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations, urging full commitment of the U.S. and the U.N. to the free and fair referendum advocated by the UN and the Organization of African Unity.  With Secretary-General Boutros-Khali's new report scheduled for the end of May, action is needed NOW.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People in southen Africa are scared, and they have a right to be.  Their corn fields lie scorched and wasted by the region's worst drought in decades. Cattle are dying. Water sources are drying up just as the long dry season begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National emergencies have been declared throughout the region and an international relief effort has been initiated. Some diplomats and aid officials, however, are concerned that donor fatigue and a perceived tilt by the West toward eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are blunting our sense of urgency and willingness to respond.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I left southern Africa in April, late rains had restored an illusory patina of green to the landscape. Compared to the Horn of Africa or the Sahel -- the more traditional range for killer droughts -- much of southern Africa seemed almost verdant to the casual observer. A closer look, however, revealed that what appeared to be healthy stands of corn -- the region's staple -- actually bore no cobs or kernels. The almost total lack of rain during the critical growing period in January and February aborted as much as half the region's harvest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The food security unit of the 10-nation Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) estimates that the corn harvest will be 40% less than last year's below-average production. SADCC members expect to import 7 million metric tons of corn and other cereals to meet the shortfall. South Africa, which normally exports corn to its neighbors, will import another 4 million tons. The region thus will need about 12 million tons in the coming year. Ethiopia, during its 1984-85 apocalypse, imported less than 2 million tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Africa drought victims are not expected to congregate in large camps where their misery can be observed en masse by the international media. The suffering and dying will be largely hidden, as it was in 1983 when 100,000 Mozam-bicans quietly starved to death beyond the world's notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While frequently subject to localized droughts, southern Africa is essentially a self-sustaining region in food production. Most people, in most years, are able to raise a crop. This drought, however, has engulfed the entire region with volcanic suddenness, catching villagers and governments alike unprepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, for instance, in recent years has reduced its once enormous (and costly to store) corn reserve by exporting to neighboring countries and by inducing commercial farmers -- through disincentive pricing -- to shift to cash crops such as tobacco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the drought has combined with a painful economic restructuring program in Zimbabwe to produce severe deprivation. Although designed to produce a healthier economy in the medium term, the price liberalizations, civil service cutbacks and other austerity measures have begun causing serious hardships. The most visible burden is the extreme shortage and rising cost of mealie meal (ground corn flour). Riot police already have been called out in Harare, the capital, to contain potential violence at shops selling limited stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in Zambia, the drought is an untimely challenge to the recently elected government of President Frederick Chiluba. Zambians have high expectations that Chiluba will rapidly revive their standard of living after years of steep decline under former President Kenneth Kaunda. The acid test for Chiluba will focus on his ability to ensure adequate supplies of mealie meal at affordable cost. But even under the best scenario, the drought will prevent Chiluba from delivering on his economic promises this year, and Zambians' renewed faith in multiparty democracy could be shaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drought is so severe in Mozambique that Renamo rebels are allowing captive villagers to seek water and food in government-held areas. Cholera, which killed hundreds last year, has broken out in the port city of Beira. One expert fears it could spread &quot;explosively&quot; in the peri-urban bairros crowded with rural refugees from both war and drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The causes of such a sudden dry spell are unknown, though some ascribe it to global warming and worry that conditions could worsen in future years.  Whatever its origins, this is a drought that (conservatively) will kill tens of thousands and shorten the lives of countless others, especially children. The drought also threatens to undermine the democratization, economic reforms and hard-won peace now sinking tentative roots in the region from South Africa to Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an American election year, these factors may not count for much.  Pat Buchanan has been urging abolition of foreign assistance. Aid levels have been frozen. And we seem increasingly preoccupied with sustaining our former Soviet Bloc antagonists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite by accident, Africa, eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States have arrived simultaneously at a critical juncture in their political and economic evolution. All have an equal claim upon our good will and largess. However, with the Cold War now in cold storage, we seem more inclined to help our former ideological adversaries than the pawns we once courted in the Third World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As East Europeans burn their Communist bridges and receive generous U.S. and Western assistance in return, African nations which earlier embarked on courageous economic reforms -- at our urging -- fear that they will be left without the financial support needed to stay the course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The level of Western response to the southern African drought (as well as that in the Horn of Africa) will suggest whether this fear is legitimate.  Given the temptation in this American political season to borrow from Peter to pay Paul, or from southern Africa to benefit Kazakhstan, the answer appears all too evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there be fewer wells dug than there could have been, if there are fewer seeds to plant next season, if more malnourished children are claimed by opportunistic disease in the coming year of want, southern Africans will be left to ponder the seeming fickleness of our generosity. n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 25. We landed in Nairobi without incident, and I was surprised how serene Nairobi appeared on our late-night taxi ride into town. I had spent several months of anxious letter writing, telephone calls, and faxes trying to scrutinize the current situation in Kenya. Is President Daniel arap Moi holding on, or is he losing it? Is the University still open, or closed again? How goes the drought? Is it really as bad as 1984? How many refugees have come in to the north from Ethiopia and Somalia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've come back to Kenya to continue my research on Rendille and Ariaal, pastoralists of Marsabit district, Kenya's arid northernmost region. I was anxious about reports of extensive livestock raiding in the North by groups armed with guns brought by the flood of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading the Daily Nation was sobering: photos of women and children slain in the town of Molo near Nakuru in the Rift Valley; the victims of fighting between Kalenjin supporters of Moi against Luo and Kikuyu farmers, who are now treated en masse as the opposition. The Nation is bolder than in 1990 when I last visited Kenya. It is now openly calling for the government to stop the ethnic fighting and supporting the churches' call for multiparty elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a dinner party with a mixed crowd of Kenyans and Americans, we discussed Kenya's politics. Most there were supporters of Ford (Forum for the Restoration of Democracy), including several Kikuyu, who preferred the progressive and multi-national Ford to the conservative Kikuyu Democratic Party. Everyone expressed horror at the Molo killings, where even the bodies of children were burned by the attackers. Some say Kanu, the ruling party, was directly behind the Kalenjin violence. (The Kalenjin are closely related to President Moi's small ethnic group, the Tugen.) Others said there were reports of military helicopters dropping arrows to the attackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence is beginning to spill into Nairobi, where a Kalenjin was killed at the bus station by angry Kikuyus. One of the dinner guests remarked, &quot;This killing is no longer politics; it is now a matter of vengeance. 'You killed my brother, now I must take yours.' &quot; Everyone seemed worried. I don't have the sense that people know when this will end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 30. It's a relief to head up North. When we left Nairobi, several thousand university students were demonstrating, blocking a long portion of Uhuru Highway with signs that read, &quot;Down With Moi. Down With Saitoti.&quot; We left town quickly. These demonstrations can turn ugly, and violent. Driving around Mount Kenya from Nanyuki, I am amazed how green everything looks. The spring rains have been good so far, at least in the central highlands. Even as we descend into the vast northern lowlands at Isiolo, the desert is green with flowering acacia trees and grasses. We see Samburu cattle herders, Rendille camel pastoralists, and Turkana, grazing their animals along the Vaso Nyiru near the turn-off to the Samburu gamepark. But these cattle are emaciated, and I know that the onset of rains here after a 19-month drought accelerates death and famine, as insects bring new diseases to finish off the weak in herds. The Rendille are better prepared than the Samburu for drought, because they rely on camels rather than cattle for milk and meat.  But even in Rendille country, we see scores of carcasses--cattle, small stock, even camels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We finally arrived at our destination of Korr, in the center of Rendille country, with Mount Marsabit to the northeast, Mount. Kulal and Lake Turkana to the northwest, and the Ndoto mountains to the southwest. The Rendille and Gabra live in the lowland deserts. Samburu and Boran cattle keepers prefer the highlands to the west and east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My reunion at Korr is warm and friendly as always. I am the guest of Larian who runs a shop with his wife Annamarie and serves as my assistant, interpreter, driver and best friend during my fieldwork. I also meet my friends Patrick and Kawap. The news they bring is simple and disheartening. This year's drought has been devastating, and the raids on the area by the Gabra, Boran, and Somalis are becoming intolerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kawap, an elder of about 50 years, is one of the first Rendille to be educated in the Catholic schools of Marsabit in the 1960s. We had a long conversation in his quiet house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think these two years have been the worst years for Rendille, the worst I have known. There are so many animals dying of different diseases. Many camels died, cattle died, many goats and sheep. I think some people who had 100 cattle -- maybe two, three, four remain. For myself, I can tell you exactly.  I had 300 goats and sheep, but now only 73 remain. Cattle were 34, and now only 11. Camels 13, now only two remain. Others have been completely wiped out. You hear of people running into the bush mad, tearing their clothes off and crying, wanting to die. We brought them back. And even some people have died from this drought; four people in Kargi, north near Mount Marsabit died just starving. If it were not for these mission foods, you would see hundreds, even thousands dying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is worse than 1984. Then we had a lot of famine relief. We had so much yellow maize we were feeding it to our goats. Our houses were stocked like shops. But now we have the problem of refugees from Ethiopia and refugees from Somalia. There are 60,000 refugees in Moyale on the Ethiopian border. And we can hardly find sugar in the shops or posho (corn meal). Posho is so expensive because there is so little of it .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now we face many attacks from the Boran and Gabra to the north and Somalis and Boran to the east. I think 3,000 camels have been taken from the Rendille in the past two months. When we defend with our spears, we get killed by guns. Three people were killed last week near Kargi by Boran who came not to kill people but to take animals because it is so dry and there are so many people who are suffering. But these people, they get their guns from the refugees, who sell guns for nothing, for 100 shillings ($ 3) even, just to buy some small amount of posho or sugar. These are big rifles, Kalashnikov I think they call them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is trying but they aren't doing much. These government police or army, you know they aren't from here. They come from Kikuyu or the highlands;they don't knoe how to track; they can't even walk in this desert .  For that we need the live stock theft unit which is many Rendille and Samburu.  But they are far away from here&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 3. We heard last night that the Gabra had raided Rendille near Kargi, 36 miles (60 km) to the north, and that five or six people were killed.  Patrick, a young Rendille elder with a large herd of animals, rushed off to Kargi in the land rover of Abdi, a local shopkeeper, to hear the news directly of this latest Gabra raid. He returned that night telling us:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They attacked yesterday in three places, about twenty men each time, about half armed with guns. They took thirty camels and 1,200 goats and sheep from Kargi, but we got the goats and sheep back. They shot an elder and four young people, two boys and two girls, whose father had taken them to the Fora refugee camp to drink milk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another elder, a school teacher from Kargi, is seriously wounded with a bullet through his lung. The elders are sending a message to all Rendille to come north and be prepared for war. We are telling the Gabra, 'If you can climb into the sky or into the ground you better do it, because we are coming after you now.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larian is more cautious. &quot;This thing will only escalate. It is a senseless war. It started when two Rendille boys eager to be initiated as warriors killed a Gabra boy a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Gabra and Rendille, we are not friends, but we have not fought each other since 1972. The Rendille elders wanted to pay 50 cattle to the Gabra to avoid the war, but the Gabra refused saying they wanted the lives of the boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could not agree and the two boys ran away and hid. Now Gabra have come back to revenge. But truly, I believe this is the government's fault. They could have arrested those two boys one year ago, and there would have been peace. But they didn't. And even now, they bring their police to Kargi town, but they just stay in town doing nothing. The government could have stopped this thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annamarie quietly adds, &quot;The vengeance won't stop. It will just continue and continue. We will go and kill some of theirs, and they will return and kill some of ours. It will only end when there are no more warriors left to fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 4. I meet with Monte Wambili, a leading Rendille elder. Monte is about 50 years old, a quiet and serious man who had fought as a warrior in the battles against the Boran in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through Larian, I asked Monte if there is any way to avoid a war.  Monte replies softly but in no uncertain terms: &quot;We must fight; things cannot stay like this. Now they are stealing from us so many animals. It is better that I am killed than let things go on this way. The first time they raided our small stock in camels, and we could have forced a revenge at that time; then we would not have this raid a second time. If they had killed some of our people they would have also lost some people. We are going to have a meeting, we cannot live as cowards, we cannot run away now. So we are going to revenge.  They will lose some people. We cry, so they too will cry . How can we cry by ourselves only and they don't cry with us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way we get to end this thing is fighting. It is not good but it will happen anyhow. It is not something we wish to give, but only fighting will stop it. When they too have lost people then it will end. We are caught in the middle like a chair in this room. We have no place to move. They have been attacking us. We go to Laisamis and they attack us there, and now Gabra from the other side (north). And now these people are attacking us on both sides, armed with weapons from Somalia and Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This government does not protect our people, and in one month 3,000 camels were stolen. The government will try to find our animals, but they cannot bring the people back. If the government will act like a government and protect us than we can be a bit tolerant and hope for peace. But I do not think this will happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aid to Malawi will be discussed this week in Paris amid opposition calls for donors to freeze all development contributions until the government agrees to political reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition groups in exile have asked donors to halt all aid beyond drought and refugee relief until &quot;President for Life&quot; Kamuzu Banda's regime respects human rights and allows a transition to multiparty democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi is heavily dependent on foreign aid -- in 1989, $ 394 million from donors accounted for a quarter of the country's gross national product, according to 1991 World Bank figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call to stop development contributions to Malawi follows a recent decision by donors to suspend aid to Kenya in response to government corruption and violence toward pro-democracy demonstrators. The United States cut its planned 1992 aid to Kenya by more than a third. A spokesperson for the Agency for International Development said the U.S. is now reviewing its assistance to Malawi,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda, in his 90s, has ruled Malawi as a one-party state since independence 27 years ago, driving opponents underground or out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exiled opposition came home in early April, but didn't get very far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chakufwa Chihana, secretary-general of the Southern African Trade Union Coordinating Council, was arrested April 6 as he stepped off the plane at the Lilongwe airport with the text of a speech calling for democratic reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda had vowed at a speech during a rally in March that returning opposition members would end up as &quot;meat for crocodiles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soldiers who took power in Sierra Leone late last month are promising to step down in favor of a democratically elected government after they end a rebellion in the east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are only patriotic Sierra Leoneans,&quot; said Captain Valentine Strasser, in a radio broadcast April 30th, the day President Joseph Momoh fled to Guinea. &quot;As soon as we all put our hands together and set this nation on the right track for meaningful development, we shall return to our military barracks where we rightfully belong.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Momoh, who took office in 1985, as President Siaka Stevens' hand-picked successor, had promised multiparty elections in November. But opponents accused him of using the war along the Liberian border as an excuse to postpone the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villages have been destroyed and thousands have been killed or driven from their homes in fighting between two Liberian factions and between the Sierra Leonean government and a rebel group calling itself the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). Led by Corporal Foday Sankoh, RUF is an offshoot of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia. (See &quot;Liberia&quot;, page 1.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government soldiers fighting the rebels drove to the capital of Freetown April 29th, to demand three months back pay, food and equipment. Their protest turned into a coup when Momoh dismissed the soldiers as troublemakers, and troops he sent to quell the revolt joined in the takeover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strasser, who has been named head of state, defense minister and chairman of the National Provisional Ruling Council, claimed Momoh was overthrown to end 23 years of rule by the oppressive and corrupt All People's Congress Party, which he said wrecked the economy and the country's infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strasser claimed the new government will aim to end fighting in the east and pursue the process of returning the country to multiparty democracy.  He has called on rebels to lay down their arms and work toward &quot;national reconstruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ruling council has also pledged to restructure Sierra Leone's economy. Coup leaders appointed Momoh's former finance minister and World Bank official Jim Funa to the new government. Funa had previously negotiated an agreement in which the International Monetary Fund resumed loans to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No date for the promised elections has been announced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- West African peace initiative is showing new signs of life in Liberia, after months of political stalemate that has kept the country on the brink of renewed civil war. Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor, whose army holds most of the country, has agreed to the deployment of a West African peacekeeping force into areas under his control and has said his troops will lay down their weapons and move into supervised camps within the next 60 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor sent word of his pledge to a meeting of prominent Liberians in Washington on May 2nd, and he confirmed his promise in a telephone interview from Gbarnga, his provisional headquarters 125 miles (200 km) from the Liberian capital, Monrovia. &quot;We are committed to disarmament, we are committed to encampment and we expect to have elections that are free and fair,&quot; Taylor said in the interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first contingents of the West African force -- known as Ecomog -- moved into Taylor-held territory last week to create a buffer zone along the border Liberia shares with Sierra Leone, where recent fighting between Taylor's troops and a group of former Liberian soldiers has threatened a return to the turmoil that has devastated the country over the last two and a half years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington meeting, held at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and co-sponsored by the Atlanta-based Carter Center, the Brookings Institution and two Liberian groups, was convened to explore prospects for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian conflict began at the end of 1989 with an invasion by a small group of Taylor's men and eventually escalated into a brutal war that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of over half the population. Despite repeated attempts by the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) to end the fighting and hold free and fair national elections, Liberia -- a nation founded in the mid-19th century by freed American slaves -- remains deeply divided today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monrovia, where about a third of the total country's population of 2.6 million has taken refuge, is administered by an interim government established by a broad range of Liberian political, civic, and religious organizations. The rest of the country lies behind lines controlled by Taylor's National Patriotic Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Previous attempts by the West Africans to win Taylor's cooperation have faltered, principally because the rebel leader regards the Nigerian-led mediation as an illegitimate intervention designed to block him from taking power. The latest regional initiative was launched early last month at a mini-summit of West African leaders in Geneva, convened by President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire and attended by both Taylor and the interim government president, Amos Sawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A communique signed by all participants at that meeting established a timetable for the deployment of peacekeeping troops along the Liberia and Sierra Leone border and subsequently throughout the country. Though Taylor renounced the accord on his return to Liberia, he now says he will cooperate with the plan to disarm and encamp combatants as a first step towards holding elections later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyondweh Monkomona, who chairs the election commission established under Ecowas auspices with appointees from both Taylor and Sawyer, said preparations for the voting are well underway. At the Johns Hopkins conference, Monkomona said elections could be held in six months, as the West African peace plan envisages, if sufficient resources are found. &quot;We are starting with nothing -- not a pencil, not a chair or a desk,&quot; he said, for a task that will require everything from stationery to four-wheel drive vehicles. Both the interim government in Monrovia and Taylor's provisional administration in Gbarnga have pledged $ 250,000 and have already donated $75,000 each, Monkomona said, but much more is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference at Johns Hopkins, which drew over 200 leaders from both sides of the political divide, managed to find areas of consensus on what needs to be done to achieve peace. Participants agreed to call for adherence to the agreement for disarming and encamping combatants, to appeal urgently for Sawyer and Taylor to hold their first face-to-face meeting in Liberia, and to demand that transportation and communications be opened up throughout the country.  &quot;What we have done, I think, is to reinforce the reconciliatory currents in both camps,&quot; said Dr. I. William Zartman, director of the school's African Studies Program, who served as conference chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the failed settlement attempts of the past two years indicate that further action is needed, according to the Rev. Canon Burgess Carr, a Liberian religious leader currently working for the Episcopal Church in New York, who advocates holding a national forum in Liberia to push the peace process forward. &quot;If we could get all the parties around a table -- whatever shape the table takes -- and have the kind of discussion we had here, we could solve this thing,&quot; he said following the Johns Hopkins gathering. &quot;Liberians are sick and tired of this conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers of the conference are compiling the points of consensus to be sent to both leaders and making plans to dispatch two respected older Liberians to Monrovia and Gbarnga with a request that Sawyer and Taylor name two additional persons each to join in convening a forum within the next few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support for holding a Sawyer/Taylor meeting and for increasing contacts among Liberians has also come from a convention organized by Taylor's National Patriotic Front in Gbarnga at the end of April. One resolution adopted by the gathering, which was reportedly attended by several thousand people from all parts of Liberia under Taylor's control, calls for the leaders to meet within a month &quot;on Liberian soil.&quot; A meeting between the two slated for Easter Sunday, just prior to the opening of the Gbarnga convention, was cancelled at the last minute when Ecomog decided security could not be assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interview, Taylor said the resolutions of the Gbarnga conference will serve as &quot;the Bible of what I intend to.&quot; The meeting expressed &quot;the will of the Liberian people -- my views don't matter any more,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signaling the continuing uncertainty surrounding the peace process, Taylor said the Gbarnga delegates rejected the agreement reached in Geneva, which he co-signed and which reaffirmed the peace plan drawn up by an earlier summit in the Ivorian capital of Yamoussoukro last October. The &quot;only binding document&quot; is from the Yamoussoukro meeting, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor did not make clear his objections to the Geneva communique, which states as its central premise &quot;the validity of the Yamoussoukro Accord.&quot; In Geneva, the leaders issued a new timetable for disarmament and encampment, since the one agreed in December was scuttled by Taylor's refusal to comply.  Ecomog now plans to establish control over all seaports, airports and border posts by May 14th and conclude the disarming and encamping of all factions by June 8th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One additional uncertainty is the impact the April 30th coup in Sierra Leone may have on the peace process in Liberia. The soldiers who ousted President Joseph Momoh listed the simmering fighting along the Liberian border among their grievances and called on the insurgents, who are allied with Taylor's forces, to lay down their guns. The Ecomog buffer will likely curtail the activities of the anti-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor Liberian group, Ulimo, whose attacks have recently reached deep into central Liberia, and the pro-Taylor Sierra Leone dissidents, led by Foday Sankoh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian Major General Ishaya Bakut, the Ecomog commander said the the deployment into Taylor-held areas was smooth. &quot;I believe and I pray that the problems and misunderstandings of the past will be removed as we roll forward with the plan,&quot; he said in a telephone interview just after the first units were dispatched.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EL AAIUN, WESTERN SAHARA -- For 17 years a bitter war over a piece of rocky desert along Africa's north Atlantic coast has been waged largely in obscurity. Now this dusty former outpost of the Spanish empire has become an unlikely testing ground for the United Nations' role as world peacekeeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the 25-nation UN peacekeeping force who are posted here say that the Western Saharan operation is in danger of failing completely and has raised questions about the will of the U.S. administration to fully support peace initiatives that may threaten friendly governments. King Hassan II of Morocco, considered a moderate in the Arab world, has staked the prestige of his throne on keeping Western Sahara under Moroccan rule. Americans on the UN team say the U.S. has shown little inclination to persuade the king to observe the peace accord, even when the lives of American citizens are at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 5th, the UN began deploying what is now a 375-person contingent to monitor a cease-fire between a Saharan independence movement called the Polisario Front and the Moroccan military, which invaded the territory when Spain withdrew in 1975.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, known as Minurso, was charged with supervising a referendum in which the Saharans would choose between independence and union with Morocco. But the peace plan is badly off track. The vote, scheduled for January 6th, has not been held, and none of the preconditions for the balloting has been met. The UN force remains far short of its intended 2,916-person strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minurso officials have repeatedly complained to UN headquarters that a lack of cooperation from Morocco is jeopardizing the mission. They say the Moroccan government has moved in tens of thousands of Moroccans to pack the voters' rolls, has blocked supplies destined for forces in the field, has refused to provide information on the number of its troops and their locations, and has interfered with UN patrols. On at least one occasion, Moroccan soldiers drew their weapons and threatened to fire on a patrol that included Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last February the State Department barred Col. Albert Zapanta, the top U.S. official with the initial Minurso deployment, from testifying about the Saharan operation before the House Foreign Affairs Africa Subcommittee. Zapanta says he would have told the committee that the U.S. needs to put its weight behind the peace effort. &quot;It was obvious to me that there were forces at work in Morocco that blocked and stalled and impeded our progress wherever they could,&quot; he says. &quot;I think that the U.S. can use its influence on the Moroccan authorities to ensure that our soldiers and officers in the field are not threatened any longer and to nudge the process along.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report released by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March, committee staffer George A. Pickart called Senate attention to the problems, which he said endanger the health and lives of the 30 Americans serving in Western Sahara. Citing what he called &quot;Morocco's obstructionist posture toward Minurso,&quot; including refusal to allow mission supplies through customs, the report said that illness from unsanitary conditions and extremes of weather has been common. Pickart also criticized the United Nations' hierarchy for failing to provide the political and logistical support to solve the problems. Like Zapanta, Pickart urged the U.S. government to exert its substantial influence to secure Morocco's compliance with the terms of the accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate plans to hold hearings on the Saharan situation prior to the May 25th congressional recess and Zapanta says he expects to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has acknowledged the lack of progress towards a referendum as well as the complaints against Morocco. In a nine-page report to the Security Council, he said Morocco has been responsible for 75 of 77 cease-fire violations, and he set a deadline for resolving the issues that are blocking implementation of the peace plan. The Secretary-General warned that unless there is agreement by the end of May, &quot;it will be necessary to consider alternative courses of action and possibly adopt a new approach to the whole problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 24th, Boutros-Ghali appointed a new Special Representative for Western Sahara to replace Swiss diplomat Johannes Manz, who resigned last January. The new envoy, Sahabzada Yakub Khan of Pakistan, has already toured the region, visiting Saharan refugee camps in Algeria and meeting with representatives of both Polisario and Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A visit to Western Sahara suggests that the small Minurso force has been given a difficult if not impossible task. The muted UN reaction to Moroccan intransigence has contributed to frustration and cynicism among the field forces - an attitude apparently shared by Johannes Manz. In a confidential memo to the Secretary-General just before his resignation, Manz expressed &quot;great sadness&quot; at the lack of a forceful response to Morocco's breaches of the peace accord. He urged that the UN &quot;firmly retake the initiative in this complex process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace plan accepted by Morocco and Polisario in 1990 calls for the UN to oversee the establishment of conditions for a free and fair referendum, including the identification and registration of voters and the creation of a climate of confidence and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the question of voter eligibility has dominated public discussion, it is the ability to foster a sense of security among Saharans that may prove most elusive. &quot;This is the worst police state I have ever seen,&quot; says one Minurso member who has served in several parts of Latin America and Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a visitor returning to Western Sahara after a long absence, there is an almost eerie sense of disorientation. Fifteen years ago, El Aaiun was a picturesque village, dominated by the whitewashed domes of traditional Saharan architecture. Today, the capital is a city of square concrete structures sporting the ochre and sienna tones favored by Moroccan builders. Moroccan settlers, drawn by the lucrative tax and financial incentives offered by the government, have fueled a building boom and now account for an estimated half the 100,000 population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moroccan professionals, encountered in businesses and hotels, speak of their time in Western Sahara as an involuntary tour of duty. A teller at the Banque Commerciale du Maroc says that his four-month assignment in El Aaiun is nearly over and he is eager to return to his job in the Moroccan port city of Agadir. A clerk, whose husband was assigned to teach in a Saharan school, says she pines for her home in Casablanca. &quot;I don't like it here,&quot; she says. &quot;It's different and it's dirty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But like Europe's former colonies in Africa and Asia, Western Sahara has offered enterprising settlers a way to get ahead. The manager of one of El Aaiun's largest hotels says he was a kitchen helper and a waiter in Switzerland before coming to the Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the boom-town atmosphere, the graceful, billowing Saharan garments -- sari-like wraps for women and pale blue or white robes for men -- have mostly disappeared. Over the past few months, Moroccan authorities have asserted increasing pressure on local residents to abandon their distinctive dress, a policy Saharans say is intended to make them invisible to international visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morocco strictly enforces a lack of contact between Saharans and UN personnel. Armed soldiers guard the entrances to Minurso headquarters and to the two main hotels where mission members are bunkered. Saharans say anyone who tries to approach the UN locations is turned away and often arrested. Only in the outlying desert sites, where international teams monitor the cease-fire, is there a semblance of free exchange between UN observers and Saharans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But difficulties have persisted there, too. UN forces report being denied access to places within their patrol areas by armed Moroccan soldiers.  In one incident, a Moroccan jeep sideswiped a Minurso vehicle to prevent its progress into an area the Moroccans had declared off limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a hill perched above UN headquarters, a make-shift tent camp has become the most visible evidence of the problems facing UN peacekeepers. The tents, decorated with symbols of the Moroccan royal family, house thousands of people that the Moroccan government says are Saharan nomads, gathered to exercise their right to vote. The area remains off limits to Minurso by order of the Moroccan government, and journalists are allowed in only with official escorts. A visitor's car attempting to pass a sentry point on the camp's perimeter was whistled to a stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the purpose of the tents, a guard said they were pitched to shelter &quot;the people who have come to vote that the Sahara is Moroccan.&quot; He said the tent dwellers had been bused in from such southern Moroccan cities as Goulemime and Tiznit, and he warned that approaching the tents or photographing them is forbidden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tent city is a reminder that, eight months after the cease-fire, the warring parties are no closer to agreeing on a voters' role. Deciding who is Saharan, in a vast desert where nomads roam across national borders, is the unenviable task of the Minurso Identification Commission. But disputes over the criteria for determining Saharan origins have brought the identification process to a halt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the peace negotiations, Polisario and Morocco accepted a 1974 Spanish census that counted 74,000 Saharans as the basis for the voters' roll.  Since that time, however, King Hassan has demanded the addition of 120,000 people he says have Saharan ancestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of his last acts in office, former UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar proposed expanded eligibility criteria, including proof of intermittent residency in the territory for 12 years prior to the 1974 census.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That attempt to accommodate the king's position, combined with the continuing heavy hand that Morocco is exercising in the territory, has eroded Saharan faith in the UN effort. &quot;We are exactly like Kuwait, invaded by our neighbor,&quot; said one Saharan. &quot;When the UN came, we were happy. But now we are afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saharans expected Minurso to investigate Polisario complaints that hundreds of people are bring detained by Moroccan authorities, under the noses of UN observers. But there has been no formal inquiry, and Morocco has refused to admit independent human rights groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN observers believe that the peace process is now at a point of critical transition and that the appointment of a new Special Representative may revive the morale of UN troops. The decision by the Minurso commander, General Armand Roy of Canada, to begin flying the blue UN flag at headquarters -- in defiance of a Moroccan ban on symbols of UN authority -- has cheered the forces already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there is a growing conviction within Minurso that Morocco has no intention of leaving Western Sahara, whatever the outcome of a referendum.  In his private memo to the Secretary-General, former Special Representative Manz said that a negotiated agreement &quot;with neither a clear winner nor a clear loser&quot; may offer the only prospect for a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Col. Zapanta, who was deputy Minurso commander as well as the ranking American officer, believes that any solution to the Saharan impasse will require aggressive action. &quot;Out of all the countries (in Minurso),&quot; he says, &quot;it's the United States that has the credibility with all the players and the power to make it happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other UN observers said that more than the success or failure of one mission is at stake. Only if the world body proves tough enough to implement its own accords, they said, can it credibly claim the mantle of peacekeeper. n By Tami Hultman</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Generals Said to Plan Power Grab for Mobutu</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">467 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When President Mobutu Sese Seko considers what his future might hold if the balance of power shifts in favor of his opponents, he has only to look across the river from his yacht to Brazzaville, the capital of neighboring Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, a Congolese national conference turned into an inquisition into the 12-year rule of President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who after the three months of deliberations was left with only ceremonial powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, a Mobutu protege, suffered a similar fate when spreading protests and demonstrations forced him to allow a national democracy conference in Togo's capital Lome.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well-placed sources in Zaire, whose inside information has proven reliable over the past several months, report that plans have been formulated to seize control of the country if Mobutu's hold on power seems threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They may be following the example of the Togolese army, which last December staged an uprising, laying seige to the national conference meeting hall and -- for a brief period -- taking the conference-chosen prime minister as their captive. Although President Eyadema was outside of Lome when the troops acted and said he had no role in encouraging their intervention, the soldiers won concessions for the president that restored some of his authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zaire, the sources report, a group of army generals loyal to the president -- some on active duty, others assigned to civilian posts -- held a series of meetings over Easter weekend to devise a plan for seizing strategic locations throughout the capital, Kinshasa. The takeover might be triggered by a deadlock in the national conference discussions or might occur when the president seems to be losing ground to his opponents. The objective of the seizure would be to position Mobutu to step in as mediator between the opposition political coalition and the military, enhancing his stature internationally, and perhaps extending his hold on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout his three-decade rule, Mobutu has averted military threats to his control, both by rewarding handsomely those closest to him and by periodic reshuffling of the top posts to keep any one officer from gaining too much authority. Another top level shift is being planned in connection with preparation for the takeover, according to the sources.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c8">ZAIRE'S WEIGHTY CRISIS PERSISTS</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2747 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KINSHASA, ZAIRE -- If there is such a thing as economic anarchy, it exists here, where cash is weighed instead of counted, bankers beg clients to deposit money and the exchange rate climbs faster than a scared monkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is so little confidence in the country's currency, the Zaire, that a national conference on democracy, currently meeting in this central African capital, worked out its operating budget in U.S. dollars. But it is unclear where money to pay the proposed $ 12.8 million for the conference will come from, since the government already has a spending deficit of about $ 200 million and the state still does not have a budget for this fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government theft and mismanagement have sent the annualized inflation rate soaring to 5,000 percent. Unemployment is estimated at 70%. Twenty years ago, it was possible to buy a car for as little as 500 Zaires. Now, the largest denomination bill in circulation, the 200,000 Zaire note, is worth just less than two dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing economic crisis parallels a political stand-off that pits a lively pro-democracy movement against President Mobutu Sese Seko, who came to power 27 years ago with backing from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.  Tensions have escalated since December 5th, when Mobutu's latest presidential term expired with no indication that he would keep an earlier pledge to call national elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, Mobutu is facing the greatest challenge of his long tenure, with an opposition coalition demanding that he cede power, particularly the power of the purse. Under international pressure to respond to democracy demands, the government grudgingly allowed a national conference to convene to discuss the country's political future. During the last two years, such conferences have become common in Africa as a means of stripping power from authoritarian governments and paving the way for democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean president is one of the continent's last longtime rulers, and he has more to lose than most. During his three decades in office, Mobutu has become one of the world's richest people, with a personal fortune estimated at billions of dollars that many Zaireans say was siphoned from the national treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roman Catholic Archbishop Monsengwo Pasinya, who was formally chosen as president of the democracy conference last month, has called for an investigation into allegations by some delegates that Mobutu's government has been paying off conference participants to buy influence over the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no patriotism in this country,&quot; says Kayemba Ntamba, a political science and law professor at the University of Kinshasa. &quot;Power is founded on money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We of the second republic in Zaire are accustomed to cheating people,&quot; says 29-year-old Katambwa Mike Masiya, a reporter for Umoja newspaper, one of Zaire's oldest. &quot;It is now in the heads of people to such a point that they can't control it. It is a psychological problem. It is Mobutu's policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communications employees routinely rip telephone wires out of the ground so residents will slip them some extra cash to fix them. Where the Bureau des Routes does not step in to repair roads, teenagers and young children do. They fill in the yawning potholes of Kinshasa's decaying streets with dirt and rocks, hoping drivers will stop and give them a tip. Zaire has its own form of toll roads; soldiers haphazardly set up roadblocks at night to extract every possible bit of cash, cigarettes or beer from the vehicles they stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the democracy movement sees it, if Mobutu has reasons to resist the shift of power, Zaire has more to gain from honest, competent government than most countries.  Zaire is potentially one of Africa's richest nations; it is the world's second largest exporter of industrial diamonds (behind Australia), and its soil is packed with cobalt, copper and uranium. The power of the Zaire River, if harnessed, could provide electricity for all of Africa and most of Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But years of corruption and diversions of public funds have left the country -- which is the about the size of Alaska, Texas, and California combined -- with a deteriorated infrastructure that affects every aspect of economic activity. The state-run Gecamines mining industry is expected to produce less than 200,000 tons of copper this year, half the output in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The escalating spiral of political protests and government resistance to democracy demands has further disrupted economic and civic life. To stem campus protests two years ago, the government closed universities. For most of this year, strikes have emptied public primary and secondary schools and most of the country's hospitals. As in the majority of the job actions by public servants, strikers were not only asking for monies due them -- after months without paychecks -- but were also pressing for political demands, in this case the resumption of the national conference after its suspension by the government in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic situation has worsened considerably since last September, when unpaid soldiers went on a looting spree throughout the country. Civilians joined the pillaging, which cost Zaire an estimated $ 1 billion in damage and prompted the evacuation of 15,000 foreigners, many of whom owned businesses providing jobs for Zaireans. Kinshasa's Cite district, home to Zaire's middle-class, is by Western standards a rapidly disintegrating urban slum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire's Banking Association warned recently that the 12 commercial banks operating in the country would be forced to close their doors because of insufficient cash to operate. Already, banks are shut most of the time, dealing with selected customers through the back door. Most withdrawals are limited to the equivalent of $ 5 or $10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My banker came to me the other day begging me to deposit some money,&quot; said one businessman, who like others interviewed for this story declined to be identified. Most businesses in the capital conduct their affairs in international currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Umoja newspaper recently poked fun at the national slogan written on Zaire's currency, &quot;Peace, Justice, Work,&quot; saying it should read, &quot;Chaos, Decadence, Debauchery.&quot; Economists and businessmen speculate that the government may be manipulating the currency, planning to release it all at once, which would force up the exchange rate, and then blame the resulting debacle on the national conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overseas, the country's embassies are suffering from the crisis as well. Zaire's mission to the United Nations was threatened with eviction from its New York offices last month for back-due rent of $ 400,000. (Attorneys representing Zaire said last week that the bill has been paid and the eviction notice withdrawn.) The country's embassy in London has received a similar threat: pay up or leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A leading European businessman said the government sends lorries to the central bank to retrieve money to pay parliament. But it bypasses the central bank, flying money in from abroad, to pay the presidential guard, he said. Sources close to the government say when money is flown in from Germany, where it is printed, a helicopter picks up the delivery and flies it directly to Mobutu's luxury yacht on the Zaire river where the president spends much of his time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the banks and sandbars of the river, dozens of abandoned riverboats have become homes for desperate immigrants from the country's interior. The migrants string up pieces of ragged cloth for privacy or retreat into the bowels of the boat's machinery for protection against afternoon rains and wind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The search for food has also become increasingly difficult, although there is no evidence of hoarding. In fact, inflation stabilized in February because so few people could afford to buy food. &quot;We don't eat at noon, or at 2 p.m.,&quot; says 26-year-old Charlotte Bodesi, secretary of a local non-governmental organization for women and development. &quot;We eat when we have something to eat.&quot; For many families, that means rotating the days that different children are fed, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the cases of Kambungu Faustin, Lupangu Nzala and a woman who calls herself only Marie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kambungu, a blind man of 60, whose wife died last year, has four children and relies on handouts from the church and his neighbors to survive.  Sitting on a wooden chair in front of his one-room scrap metal home, he says he is waiting for his daughter to return home with some money to feed him and the other three children. The daughter is 13 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lupangu is 41 years old and looks well into his 50s. He walks two hours to work each day, but he is so thin he looks as though he barely has the strength to raise himself from his bed each morning at 5:30 a.m. &quot;There were two or three days when I didn't eat this week, but I made the effort to come here, because I have work, even if I don't have the energy,&quot; said Lupangu, who works as a handyman for the health department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marie, like others of her profession here, is referred to as a &quot;free woman.&quot; She's a prostitute, but she doesn't sell her body to support a drug habit. She takes two to three clients a week at the equivalent of $ 2.50 each tofeed herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mama Yemo Hospital, Zaire's premier health care institution that is named after Mobutu's late mother, is the ideal metaphor for the country's decaying social, economic and political infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical workers went on strike February 21st demanding higher wages and resumption of the national conference. With virtually no one to attend to them, any patient who could walk went home, leaving less than 50 of the hospital's 2,500 beds occupied. The only signs of life were a few wards where AIDS patients lay dying. Mama Yemo was once reputed to have one of the the highest number of births of any maternity ward in the world. A visitor today will find only a handful of mothers and babies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the democracy conference resumed, most doctors and nurses have returned to work, hoping a solution to their economic woes lies at the forum.  Meanwhile, Mama Yemo, like many institutions in Zaire, appears to be going back to nature. White birds that look like small storks pick through garbage cans on the open grounds of the hospital. Vines grow through the windows of a once-thriving 14-room surgery ward and black cobwebs hang from its crumbling corners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only medical supplies available are the remains of earlier donations by Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF (Doctors Without Borders). Those bandages and medicines are saved for emergencies, says Dr. Tombe Diabeno, chief of surgery. Some were used after troops fired on peaceful anti-government demonstrators February 16th, when human rights groups estimate that up to 32 people died and more than 100 were injured. Much of the rest was stolen by soldiers who were sent to the hospital to replace striking medical workers, said one diplomat, who didn't want to be identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only people who are likely to find medical care are those with money, says Diabeno. &quot;If they don't have the money, they're going to die. When someone comes here, he must come with the material to give it to the surgeon because in the hospital there is no material. We have no gloves or alcohol,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgium, Zaire's former colonial power, as well as the United States, France and the European Community, have severed all but humanitarian aid to Zaire to pressure the government towards democratic reforms. However, the international community's lack of confidence in Zaire's move towards democracy and the absence of a tangible crisis, such as last Septem-ber's looting, has made it difficult for non-governmental groups to find funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the situation is worse -- you can't identify even a calamity which you need to present for funding,&quot; said Dr. Marc Arbyn, of MSF. &quot;The situation has become chronic. For us, we go away, but for Zaire, the imports of equipment and basic medicines will stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the group's most recent funding ran out at the end of April and the chances of receiving additional money from the European Community appear bleak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the government allowed the democracy conference to reopen last month, delegates have been working steadily to draft a charter that will regulate government procedures until elections are held. However, the conferees have yet to tackle the key issue of what form a transitional government leading to elections would take, and what Mobutu's role would be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's ruling Mouvement Populaire de la Revolution (MPR) and the Union Sacre opposition coalition have been dealing with that problem in meetings on the sidelines of the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Union Sacre has proposed that Mobutu remain head of state, with his authority limited to such ceremonial tasks as signing international accords, after consulting the government. The opposition also offered to let Mobutu remain as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, but said it was &quot;imperative&quot; that, during the transition, Mobutu &quot;stop interfering in government affairs&quot; because his actions have &quot;ruined the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPR, in a recent memo to the Union Sacre, protested that Mobutu is no &quot;passive agent&quot; of the country's politics and he should be more than a titular head of state during a transitional period. &quot;The concept of a president who reigns but does not govern is not justified,&quot; the MPR said.</SPAN></P>

Sirleaf, who is currently vice president and Washington representative of Equator Bank, is a former Liberian finance minister and former official of the World Bank and Citibank. In the mid-1980s, Sirleaf was jailed for opposition activities by the late President Samuel K. Doe, and she has been considered a possible presidential contender in the forthcoming Liberian elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sirleaf serves on the boards of directors of several organizations, including the New York-based Synergos Institute and Africa News Service. At UNDP, where she will become the first woman to head one of the agency's bureaus, she succeeds Pierre-Claver Damiba, who returned home to Burkina Faso last September to take part in national politics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

He has also served on the faculty of Howard University and is a member of the board of Africare, the Washington, D.C.-based development organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrington, who will succeed Adonis Hoffman, will be the third subcommittee staff director since Dymally assumed the chairmanship at the beginning of 1991. But his tenure may be short-lived, since Dymally is retiring from Congress at the end of this year. With so many members leaving the House this term, there is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">uncertainty about who will assume subcommittee leadership next year.  Rep. Donald Payne of New Jersey -- liry of state for African affairs, is slated to be named to head the Africa bureau of the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new law shifts the foundation of United States policy in the Horn of Africa from pursuit of strategic interests to promotion of democracy and development, according to the law's supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Horn of Africa Recovery and Food Security Act, passed by Congress April 9 and signed by the president two weeks later, ties U.S. aid to progress toward democratic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharon Pauling, policy analyst at Bread for the World, a Washington, DC-based group that lobbied for the bill's passage, said the law provides the framework to transfer aid from programs designed to support U.S. strategic objectives during</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Cold War to programs that will meet the long-term needs of the Horn's people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Doug Bereuter (R-NE), a member of the House Select Committee on Hunger International Task Force, who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">co-sponsored the bill when it was introduced a year ago, said the key parts of the act are its &quot;no democracy, no aid&quot; policy and its flexibility. The act allows the administration to selectively lift restrictions Congress imposed on aid during the Cold War.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our policy in the world now is not governed by the Cold War,&quot; says one state department official. &quot;This is an acknowledgment of reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, the act:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Prohibits U.S. development or military aid to the governments of Ethiopia, Somalia or Sudan unless they are certified as showing commitments to peace, human rights, democracy and the free distribution of emergency relief to those in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Waives other restrictions on aid, including one that blocked assistance to Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Urges that development aid be targeted to private voluntary organizations working at the grassroots level for a nation's poorest inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Provides no new funding for aid to people affected by war and famine in the Horn of Africa, but allows the unlimited use of unspent monies previously earmarked for military and strategic purposes during fiscal years 1992 and 1993. These monies can now be diverted to relief and development needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Encourages the president to press for negotiated settlements of armed conflicts in the Horn; to propose a United Nations embargo on arms shipments to the region; to pledge support for peacekeeping activities; and to press the UN secretary-general to set a high priority for cease-fires, safe corridors for emergency relief and peace agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia will probably be the only country in the Horn to benefit immediately from the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently, the United States had been blocked from giving anything but food aid to Ethiopia by the Brooke Amendment and Section 812 of the 1985 International Cooperation and Development Act. Section 812 prohibited development aid to the regime of ousted Ethiopian military ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brooke Amendment restrict. aid to governments more than a year behind in paying their debts to the U.S. government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 812 was recently repealed, and the Horn of Africa act waived the Brooke Amendment for Ethiopia at about the same time the country paid off enough debt to escape the restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certification under the act is expected to come &quot;any day now&quot; from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush for the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea (annexed by Ethiopia in 1962 but now governed by an autonomous transitional admnistration), says Bill Dougd by Ethiopia in 1962 but now governed by an autonomous transitional admnistration), says Bill Douglass of the U.S. Agency for International Development.  At that point, the U.S. can start releasing an estimated $ 80 million in development aid for 1992 and 1993.opment aid in the near future. Somalia, which lost U.S. aid in 1990 under the Brooke Amendment, is divided among competing armed factions and has no effective government.  Sudan, which lost aid when the current government came to power in a 1989 coup, is split between the Islamic fundamentalist regime of President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir in the Arab-speaking north and rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army based in the Christian and animist black African south.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An 11-year ban on political parties in Ghana was lifted May 18, following an April 28 referendum in which a new multiparty constitution was approved .  Parliamentary and presidential elections in November and December will complete the process of returning the country to democratic rule, and a newly elected government will be inaugurated January 7, 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 50% of Ghana's 8 million registered voters participated in the referendum, although the number is disputed. Officials counts showed 3,680,974 officially voting &quot;yes&quot; and 272,855 voting &quot;no&quot; to adoption of the new constitution. By all accounts the voting was fair and open, although there was concern that rural voters, in particular, had little knowledge of the provisions they approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite overwhelming support for the constitution, there is considerable hostility to provisions in the document which indemnify members of the government and military officers from prosecution for actions taken while in office since the coup of December 31, 1981. The opposition argues that the government wants to protect itself from public scrutiny, even though the military rulers handed out drastic punishment -- sometimes including execution -- to officials of previous regimes for corruption, abuse of power and mismanagement of public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's program for a return to constitutional rule has also been criticized. Major opposition parties have gone to court to lift limits on individual contributions to political campaigns and to overturn the ban on the use of old party names and slogans. The opposition accuses head of state Jerry Rawlings of trying to position himself to win the election, although he has not declared his intention to run.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not many world leaders would leave their countries for months at a time, but President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire boarded a Concorde for Paris on February 2, and has not returned. Now there is speculation he will leave for Cote d'Ivoire within the next few weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions have been high throughout the country during his absence.  Anti-government demonstrations in early February turned violent and led to the arrest of Laurent Gbagbo, leader of the Ivorian Popular Front, the county's largest opposition party. Gbagbo, who ran against Houphouet-Boigny in the 1990 elections -- the first contested vote in Cote d'Ivoire's 30-year history -- was sentenced to two years in prison after being convicted of destroying public property. Eight others, including the president of the Ivorian League of Human Rights, Rene Degny Segui, received two-year terms, while four more people received one-year sentences. Martial Ahipeaud, president of the national student organization, was sentenced to three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protestors demanded the dismissal of armed forces chief Gen.  Robert Guei, who was found responsible by a presidential Commission of Inquiry for a May 1991 raid on university dormitories in which soldiers beat and raped students. Just days before his departure for France, the president rejected the commission's recommendation that Guei be punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While away, Houphouet-Boigny has continued close oversight of the country's affairs. Prime Minister Allassane Ouattara has paid regular visits to the president, and most members of the Cabinet have been to see him as well, according to the Paris weekly Jeune Afrique.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aging strongman is facing some of the largest demonstrations since independence in 1964, a suspension of all but humanitarian aid, and a series of strikes that have spread from cities to tea plantations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda, who has stifled all dissent during his 28-year tenure, is blaming the unrest on &quot;outside influences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country where a word against the ruling Malawi Congress Party can land the speaker in jail, thousands took to the streets in mid-May in the industrial center of Blantyre and the capital, Lilongwe. At least 22 people -- the official count -- and perhaps as many as 38 -- Amnesty International's figure -- died after the government used force to disperse the protestors in Blantyre. Members of a paramilitary youth group, the Malawi Young Pioneers, attacked striking textile workers and Malawi Polytechnic students, and police opened fire on demonstrators, according to Amnesty International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unrest came a week after hearings in the case of opposition and trade union leader Chakufwa Chihana., who was arrested at the airport when he returned from exile April 6 with a pro-democracy speech in his hand. An estimated 3,000 supporters gathered outside the courtroom. Michael Lescault , of the AFL-CIO's African-American Labor Institute, predicts that crowds will swell to much larger sizes at future hearings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fifteen foreign oil firms have proposed spending between $ 3.7 and $4.2 billion to develop six Algerian oil fields in response to bid invitations from the government. The move is an attempt to attract outside cash and ease the country's debt burden.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government recently changed legislation to allow foreigners to invest in existing oil fields, despite critics claims that the new law will mean selling Algeria to outsiders. Foreigners are still restricted to owning no more than a 49% interest in Algerian oil fields, with the state-owned Sonatrach company holding the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algeria's economy is crippled by a $ 25 billion foreign debt that will require the government to make principal and interest payments of about $ 10 billion next year. Although energy exports are expected to bring the government about $ 11.5 billion this year, the country will spend almost $2.5 billion on food imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonatrach last month produced about 770,000 barrels of oil daily.  Proposed improvements to the six fields would raise output 200,000 barrels per day by the end of the century. Over the 20 years between 1993 and 2013, this would amount to one billion more barrels of oil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A number of donors expressed concern over reported violations of human rights,&quot; according to a statement from the World Bank, which chaired the consultative group meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They welcomed the government's efforts to deal with this problem so far, but also underlined the importance of further progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complaints about human rights violations led to the suspension of aid to Malawi by donors this month (see Malawi, page 3) and contributed to a similar decision on Kenya late last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $ 830 million pledged for Uganda in 1992-93 includes $500 million for health care, education and transportation projects and $ 330 million to copewith balance of payments problems created by a sharp drop in export income due to low coffee prices. Coffee sales, which produce about 90% of Uganda's export income, raised just $ 120 million this year compared with $400 million in 1987.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new round of peace talks aimed at ending more than 12 years of devastating war in Mozambique is expected to start late this month or early in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian government, brokering the talks with a Roman Catholic group, says negotiations will focus on military issues that must be resolved to allow a cease-fire between the government and rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo), founded in the mid-70s by the army of white minority-ruled Rhodesia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The June sessions will be the 11th round of talks in two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has decided to attend as a formal observer, following an April 25 meeting in Malawi between Assistant Secretary of State Herman J. Cohen and Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama. Mozambique President Joaquim Chissano says the meeting has opened the way to a settlement. The Italian government may also invite Britain, France and Portugal to observe the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is speculation that the rebels may be more willing to negotiate because of pressure from the southern African drought, which has struck hardest in Renamo strongholds in Mozambique's southern and central provinces. Thousands of peasants are leaving those areas in search of food and water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Chissano recently charged that Renamo has demanded $ 10 to $12 million to fund its future political activities before it will agree to a settlement of the conflict that has killed at least 100,000, driven hundreds of thousands more into exile, and destroyed over a third of Mozambique's health facilities and half its schools.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weeks of violence in southern and northern Nigeria have sparked new criticism of the country's military government, which is scheduled to hand over power to an elected civilian administration later this year. National and international groups have accused the government of human rights violations and are questioning its management of the transition to democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 200 and 300 people died during violence in mid-May in northern Kaduna state, before police and soldiers restored order, arresting nearly 250.  Fighting between Christians and the area's Moslem majority began with land disputes in two towns and spread to Kaduna City, the state's capital. The two sides engaged in looting, arson and attacks on men, women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unrest followed similar violence in other parts of the country:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Political tension during gubernatorial primaries in October and gubernatorial and state assembly elections in December inspired religious and ethnic violence that killed up to 1,000 during that period in the northern city of Kano and up to 5,000 in the central-eastern state of Taraba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* At least 10 people were killed and vehicles and government offices burned during the first week of May in the Nigerian capital, Lagos, and other southern cities, after a shortage of gas at the government-subsidized price caused many bus and taxi drivers to raise fares up to 400 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* After a two-day protest against high prices by university students in Lagos the following week, groups of young people barricaded streets, attacked passersby for money, set cars and buildings ablaze and looted businesses. At least 11 were killed and 120 arrested in the capital. The unrest also spread to other southern cities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The U.S. Census Bureau reports that if condom use were increased by 25% in urban areas in Africa, HIV prevalence would drop in the next 25 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 200 people contract the virus every hour around the world, and more than half are African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* AIDS is most commonly spread through sexual contact, blood transfusions, intravenous drug use and from an infected mother to her unborn child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* WHO says 10 to 15 million uninfected children, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, will lose their mothers to AIDS by the turn of the century.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inter Press Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sexual behavior among Ugandans has been changing since the establishment here two years ago of the AIDS Information Center (AIC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The high demand for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) testing and counseling in Uganda suggests that there is a preventive value of HIV testing and counseling,&quot; says an AIC report just released here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center offers free and anonymous testing for HIV -- which causes AIDS -- and counseling. The center is the first of its type in sub-Saharan Africa to offer such a service.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, over 70% of AIC clients receive the good news that they are not infected with HIV, and they can maintain that status by adopting safer sexual practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those clients who are already infected, the ability to protect their partners is also a message which can empower people to change their sexual behavior,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 30,000 clients have received HIV testing at program sites here during the past two years, according to the report. AIC recorded positive rates of HIV at about 26% in November 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between June 1991 and May 1993, 280,000 Ugandans are expected to be tested and counseled. And during that period, AIC will open additional centers in the towns of Mbarara, Mbale and Masaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIC was developed by a consortium of international donors, international and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including the Uganda government, the World Health Organization and the Uganda Red Cross Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says a recent review of AIC services by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found the quality of pre- and post-test counseling to be &quot;excellent&quot; and comparable to the best HIV testing and counseling centers in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIDS was first diagnosed in Uganda about ten years ago in the southwestern district of Rakai. Since then, the disease has spread to all parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Uganda has the highest number of reported AIDS cases in Africa, with over 30,000 confirmed AIDS cases and about 1.5 million people out of a population of 16 million estimated to be HIV positive. Nearly all infections in adults are the result of heterosexual transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1988, the country's private and public sectors, in cooperation with international organizations, have been fighting the AIDS epidemic through dissemination of information and education. According to international AIDS experts, the work in Uganda includes some of the most innovative efforts developed to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tactics include peer education in the workplace and in the informal economy, anonymous HIV testing plus counseling and support groups to bring about behavior change, and community outreach and assistance to persons with AIDS and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A vaccine trial will begin in January, according to John Rwomushana, who coordinates research with the Uganda AIDS Commission. Volunteers are to be tested on a therapeutic or post-infection vaccine. He says the vaccine is reported to delay progress of the disease by reducing the virus load and its transmissibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States, Britain, France, Sweden, Switzerland and Zaire have also tried vaccines under the auspices of the World Health Organization.  n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kinshasa, Zaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Cindy Shiner/Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's another hot Saturday afternoon in Kinshasa as Stephanie, Mireille and Rosy shuffle their tired teenage bodies into the Domino bar on the Boulevard 30 Juin for a beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephanie is wearing the same backless red flowered dress she danced in at the Spikizy (pronounced speak-easy) the night before, and Mireille has been whistling the tune to the song, ''Let's talk about sex, baby.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm better off than before,'' says Stephanie, 18. &quot;There was no work, the family didn't have anything, and I was obliged to do it,'' she says of the decision she made the day her mother died to leave school and become a prostitute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three teenagers are among a growing number of young Zairean women who have decided to sell their bodies and risk fatal disease to survive in this economically crippled capital of 2.5 million, medical workers say. Unemployment is estimated at 70% and annual inflation has soared to 5,000%.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost half of Kinshasa's prostitutes are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Although that rate sounds high, it contrasts with other central and east African capitals such as Kigali, Rwanda, and Nairobi, Kenya, where up to 90% of prostitutes are infected with the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unlike other countries in the region, which is in the heart of the continent's AIDS epidemic, the HIV prevalence in Kinshasa has stabilized, according to Mike St. Louis, a medical epidemiologist with the Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Determining how and why the occurrence of new cases has leveled off in Zaire could point health workers to strategies that might work in other countries. &quot;It is a very big question, and a central question to understand AIDS in Africa,'' said St. Louis on a recent visit here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is a question that may go unanswered. The CDC, a U.S. government funded agency, has withdrawn its financial support and its personnel from Project SIDA (&quot;AIDS&quot; in French), Zaire's AIDS program. The program is Africa's largest and most prestigious effort to combat the deadly virus, and medical workers say its closure could severely retard the continent's AIDS research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC says it is pulling out because the Zaire government cannot guarantee the security of CDC employees here. Medical workers were among 15,000 foreigners who were evacuated last September and October after unpaid soldiers led a looting spree throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions have continued to mount since last December, when President Mobutu Sese Seko refused to step down at the end of his fourth term in office.  A growing democracy movement has demanded elections to choose a successor to the strongman ruler who seized power in a 1960 coup backed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. On February 16, 1992, security forces fired on a church-sponsored pro-democracy demonstration, killing at least 40 people, according to church officials. (The government puts the number of dead at 17.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One CDC official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says that some U.S. State Department officials were &quot;thrilled&quot; after the pillaging last year, because the disorder provided an excuse to carry out earlier plans to scale back the U.S. diplomatic presence in Africa and bolster it in eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project SIDA received about $ 2.5 million in funding over four years from the CDC, St. Louis says. Other assistance came from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Medicin Sans Frontiers, the government of Belgium, the European Community, the World Bank and Zaire's Health Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project was used as a model for fighting AIDS in other countries around the world. &quot;The government of Zaire, with all of its frailties in the areas of politics and economics, has been very progressive in the area of AIDS,'' says St. Louis, noting that the Health Ministry has been open about acknowledging AIDS as a national problem and has encouraged foreign aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With support from the CDC, Zairian doctors were at the forefront of AIDS research in Africa, and St. Louis says they have become international-level scientists, despite the economic and political troubles that plague their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a very bad, bad thing. We planned a lot of things to do in Project SIDA. And these things are cut off and we can't do anything now,'' says Mukadi Ya Diul, a researcher who studies HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project SIDA conducted epidemiology research at eight sights throughout the capital, including tracking HIV infection in prostitutes, treating sexually transmitted diseases that facilitate the spread of the virus, and treating tuberculosis in AIDS patients. In Zaire, as in the United States, tuberculosis has become one of the leading opportunistic infections that kill people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With USAID's assistance, Zaire also had an enormously successful education and condom distribution campaign. The brand most widely distributed, called Prudence, has become a word synonymous with safe-sex. About 100,000 condoms were sold in Zaire in 1985. In 1989, 9 million condoms were sold, says St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project SIDA's work with prostitutes was also innovative. The organization operated two clinics especially for prostitutes, provided money for transportation to and from the clinics, and provided free HIV tests and other health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, only one clinic with limited services remains, and its clientele has dropped dramatically since last September. The number of prostitutes seeking help dropped from a high of 443 in January 1991 to about 20 last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The fact that prostitute intervention isn't going to go on at the same level will be the most visible impact'' of the departure of the CDC, according to Ann Marie Nelson, of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, D, who conducted pathology studies here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephanie is one of the few prostitutes who recently visited the remaining clinic for an HIV antibody test. She said she used protection during dozens of sexual encounters, mainly with expatriate men who frequent bars such as the Spikizy, Domino and the Atmosphere at the Intercontinental Hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as a relationship with a Belgian man entered its third month and they began having unprotected sex, Stephanie got scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was sure I had AIDS. I told him I've made love five times without a condom and I'm sure I have AIDS, and he said, 'OK, we'll go get tested and if we have AIDS, we die,' and I said, 'OK, we die then.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They both tested negative. But Stephanie, whose cousin died of AIDS last month, said it is very tempting to have unprotected sex with the men she meets who offer her more than 10 million zaires ($ 100) to have intercourse without a condom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosy said she has not had unprotected sex since becoming a prostitute three months ago. However, she is seven months pregnant, still working, and has not been tested for HIV. The Italian father of her baby was evacuated during the turmoil last October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its outside support plummeting, Project SIDA has fallen behind on tracking about 2,000 mothers and children infected with the AIDS virus, says Manzila Tarande, a deputy director of the project. Between five and ten percent of child-bearing women over the past five years in Kinshasa have tested positive for HIV antibodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical workers say they are not sure why the prevalence of infection in Zaire has stabilized, but it could be due to the country's education and condom distribution campaign and the fact that Zaire attracts few migrant workers. Infection rates are much higher in countries and areas of high mobility, such as along main truck traffic routes, and in big cities with multinational populations, researchers say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Zaire still has &quot;an enormous burden of HIV disease,'' says the CDC's St. Louis, adding that almost half of adult deaths in Kinshasa are from AIDS. &quot;The fact that (AIDS) is such a crisis in Zaire serves as only a backdrop for what is going to be happening in other countries in the next 10 years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that by the year 2000 the cumulative number of adults and children infected with HIV will triple or quadruple, rising from the current 9 to 11 million cases to a possible 30 to 40 million. At that time, developing countries will account for nearly 90% of the world total of AIDS cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As prevention efforts in countries such as Zaire fall victim to international politics and domestic economics, hopes for a vaccine intensify.  But that effort, too, is compromised by the crises. Doctors in Kinshasa wanted to begin conducting a major trial on an AIDS vaccine in Zaire using an African strain of the virus. But there will be few resources to conduct such research now that the CDC is gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''With the development of vaccine and clinical trials, we hoped to be the first in Africa to do this work,'' says Ya Diul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Green, who is wrapping up a four-year clinical study on AIDS in rural southern Zaire, says that in order to conduct proper studies on AIDS in Africa, researchers must use a local strain of the virus. ''There's no use using a North American strain to detect an African AIDS infection,'' he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairian researchers say they will continue their work using the limited resources they have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think that closing the project will have a negative impact on the knowledge of AIDS in Africa,'' says Nzilambi Nzila, a deputy director of Project SIDA, who recently returned from studying at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. &quot;We predict that the impact will be bad, but we'll see what we can do in the (transition) period.'' He says researchers will seek other funding from abroad. A national AIDS project supported by WHO will continue; an international physicians organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres, has expressed interest in working with Project SIDA and is looking for additional funding.  The group's medical workers have already begun working with the prostitute clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, 18-year-old Stephanie continues to survive by prostitution.  She says that if there were a treatment for AIDS, she could buy it with her earnings and protect herself. &quot;Now there is no means to do that, and I could die,&quot; she says. &quot;I'm forced to risk my life for 10 million zaires.'' n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since General Omar Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir seized power in Sudan three years ago, there have been growing complaints from women about human rights abuses by the Islamic fundamentalist regime he established, including harassment or worse by security officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, have criticized both the legal erosion of women's rights and the growing problem of detention and torture of women who fail to support the National Islamic Front-backed government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continuing civil war between the government, based in the Arab-speaking, Muslim north, and rebels, based in the black African, Christian and animist south, raises tensions. Southerners, who reject the government's imposition of sharia and form the bulk of the rebel army, are frequent targets of government reprisals. As more and more southerners move into shantytowns in northern cities to escape the fighting in the south, conflicts over government edicts -- such as those on the rights of women -- intensify.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 15, the U.S.-based Fund for Peace issued a report by staffers Leah Leatherbee and Hibaaq Osman, who investigated complaints about the treatment of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below are excerpts from the report:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unprecedented erosion of women's rights has occurred under the regime of General Omar Hassan al Bashir. The Bashir government's unwritten women's policy has included the humiliation, detention and in some cases even torture of female students and professionals, wives of political prisoners, and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout Sudan's modern history, the status of women has been high relative to other African and Middle Eastern countries. Women have enjoyed access to education and civil service jobs, and beginning in the 1960s, women held important positions in national ministries and local government, as well as in prestigious fields such as law, medicine and education. Moreover, women participated in many aspects of economic life both at the national and local levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bashir government is energetically attempting to reverse the progressive tendencies of the past. Upon seizing power, in June 1989, one of the regime's first acts was to ban all political and non-political organizations likely to oppose the new military government. This included women's associations not affiliated with the ruling National Islamic Front (NIF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Bashir regime came into power an estimated 20,000 persons have been dismissed from their jobs because they have been associated with groups thought to be opposed to the NIF. Many of the 20,000 are women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crude official pronouncements regarding women suggest that some women may have been dismissed on the sole basis of gender. One such pronouncement was made by Bashir himself in January 1990 when he described the ideal Sudanese woman as one who &quot;should take care of herself, her children, her home, her reputation and her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special mention should be made of women engaged in the informal economy of Sudan who work as street vendors selling food, on the margin of society and eking out a living in whatever way they can. Many of them are displaced southerners, easterners or westerners whom the government is eager to remove from the capital city. These women are frequently harassed, arrested and even flogged on the spot without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although rarely publicized, abuses against women engaged in the informal sector are routine in Khartoum, the capital, and Omdurman, the sister city across the Nile.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Dress Regulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A government announcement made in November 1991 stated that Sudanese women should appear in public only in proper Islamic dress. On December 19, 1991, a presidential decree was issued in the Al Sudan Hadith by the governor of Khartoum requiring women to wear Islamic dress. General guidelines were put forward by an all-male committee in an eight-point plan which included requirements such as satr (keeping the entire body covered), and ensuring that the dress is loose and opaque so that no figure can be discerned through the material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new dress regulations are costing Sudanese women the freedom to make decisions as personal and as fundamental as what to wear and where to work. Moreover, the dress code is completely impractical, as it is modeled on the Iranian chador (Islamic dress with head cover, usually made of synthetic material in black), which is not suited to Sudan's sweltering climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outrage about the government's policy is compounded by the pride most Sudanese women take in the traditional garment known as the thobe, a nine-meter-long dress which elegantly wraps the body. The thobe has long been a source of identity, modesty and practicality to the women of Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some believe the regime is making a conscious attempt to confuse women about these issues as a means of further stripping them of control over their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 24, the government denounced rumors that women were being punished for failing to comply with the new regulations. Acknowledging that time was needed to manufacture the new costumes at an affordable price, the government announced that the code would not be enforced until June. In a recent interview, NIF leader Hassan Turabi, claimed there was no law forcing women to wear the Iranian style of dress if they do not wish to do so. However, he did admit to a systematic policy of &quot;moral education&quot; designed to &quot;encourage&quot; women to wear Islamic dress. Meanwhile, Bashir recently announced that by May all women in public places, offices, streets and institutions should wear veils and opaque dress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeals to the general public to cooperate with the police in these matters and report women who fail to comply, as well as official statements that such women can be flogged and forced to stay in their homes, indicate that the intention is to enforce the decree immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many women said they interpreted these pronouncements as an attempt to make all men become &quot;dress police,&quot; and they expressed the fear that the apparent authorization of civilian street justice will be interpreted by zealots as a carte blanche to physically abuse &quot;improperly&quot; dressed women on the spot. Already, the Associated Press has reported the story of a woman who was stabbed to death for uncovering her hair as she washed before prayers at a public pump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this stage, it appears the government has not been able to secure widespread compliance with the new regulations. Those most vulnerable to enforcement attempts, however, are women who work or who are educated in public institutions where the regime's access and ability to coerce are most pronounced. We were told that women working for the Sudan Economic Institute are simply not permitted on the premises without accepted dress. A number of reports also indicate that some women have been sent home from their work place and ordered to &quot;dress decently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one source, the authorities are more insistent on the Islamic dress in Kordofan, and several women were beaten by the police for noncompliance. Another woman working for the United Nations Development Program in El Fasher was told by local authorities to comply with the new dress regulations. When she refused, the authorities forced her to leave her job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from Sudanese women living in Cairo indicate that there have been instances of Sudanese Embassies abroad refusing to renew the passports of women improperly attired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite government rhetoric and the incidents of harassment mentioned above, the authorities have not been successful in achieving widespread compliance with the new regulations, as more and more Sudanese women view it as the last straw in a long line of humiliating and oppressive policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December, a number of women at the University of Khartoum defied their Islamic dress code, and non-Muslim southern women are also defying the code. The Sudan Women's Union and another organizations established to preserve the national Sudanese dress have issued pamphlets protesting the regime's new restrictions on women, calling the restrictions a blatant attempt to deflect attention from the government's political and economic failures.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Marriage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another intrusion by the state into the social fabric of society, the regime is encouraging mass marriages to &quot;respect the nation's chastity&quot; and to reduce the cost of traditionally expensive weddings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mass weddings have long been a tradition in NIF circles, but it appears that the Bashir regime is now attempting to institutionalize this practice. As an incentive, the government reportedly provides new couples with 3,000 Sudanese pounds to get married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of people have already taken advantage of this money-making proposition and simply divorced soon after the wedding. The ironic effect of the government's &quot;chastity&quot; policy has been to increase the divorce rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Sudanese are upset by the regime's encouragement of mass marriages because they feel that the policy takes advantage of women in desperate economic straits who are also eager to get married. And, they feel the policy is a blatant political strategy for recruiting women into the NIF.  Others argue that scarce government resources would be better spent on health services and other basic necessities.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Land Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Land ownership is one major area in which the discrimination against women in Sudan has stark economic consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Land is usually granted by the government, and in most cases in which both husband and wife apply for land, only the husband's application is considered. If fact, it is rare for women to be granted land at all unless they are widows or have other special circumstances.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Restrictions on Travel and Movement(tx The Bashir government's attitude toward women is evident in itspromulgation of orders prohibiting women from leaving the country without theaccompaniment of a muharam - a male guardian or close relative.  Anyone who wants to travel abroad, male or female, must submit anapplication to the Ministry of the Interior to obtain an exit visa. For a man,this is a security clearance procedure and many are denied exit visas foralleged involvement in dissident activity.  A woman, purely on the basis of hergender must make an additional application to the &quot;Women's Committee,&quot; anall-male body accountable to the Ministry of Interior.  In very special cases where a muharam companion cannot be found (suchas in the case of a medical emergency or an extended period of study abroad),some women have been permitted to travel alone. In these cases, they eitherhave to have the written consent of a muharam, or the muharam is required tophysically appear before the Women's Committee to verify the accuracy of thewoman's travel account and to demonstrate that she has received permission fromthe muharam for her departure. This can be an impossible requirement to meet ifthe muharam lives far away.  Women over 60 years old are apparently permittedto go on a religious pilgrimage without a muharam.  Committee clearance, however, provides no ultimate guarantee ofpermission to leave the country. A number of cases have been reported in whichwomen were prevented from departing at the airport.  The restriction of women's freedom of movement is not confined tointernational travel. A Sudanese newspaper reported that the governor ofEastern State issued a local decree stating that women must be off the streetsand in their homes between sunset and sunrise.  Reports from inside Sudan also allege that attempts have been made byvarious local authorities to dissuade women from driving cars after 3:00 p.m. Women's freedom of movement is also restricted by a July 1991 familylaw that has been hailed by authorities as a victory for women. Under this law,a married women can visit her parents or close kin (i.e. persons whom shecannot marry) only on &quot;reasonable grounds.&quot; It is the husband who determineswhich grounds are reasonable and which are not.  According to the July law, even visits to female friends must besanctioned by the husband. A woman is not permitted to visit a male who is notclose kin under any circumstances.  Under the Bashir regime, women have been stopped when strolling orriding in a car with a male relative or friend and asked to producedocumentation establishing their relationship. One person said that to avoidtrouble with the authorities, he never leaves home with his wife withoutcarrying his marriage certificate.  Another man, who received a visit at hisoffice from a young female cousin, was sentenced to one year in jail.(shTorture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the most notable and tragic of the Bashir regimes &quot;innovations&quot; in human rights has been the introduction of the physical and psychological abuse of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, even under the most brutal of previous dictatorships, strong cultural traditions demanding the protection of women have kept female dissidents from being subjected to the mistreatment visited upon their male counterparts. In a particularly disturbing departure from past practice, female NIF members have reportedly been trained to torture female detainees.  Violations have included detention, torture and killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the examples is that of Bothaina Doka, a nurse at Khartoum Civil Hospital and a part-time employee of the Chevron Oil Company. Accused of being a supporter of the Sudanese People's Liberation movement, she was gagged with her bra, strung up by her hands and feet with her arms pulled behind her back, and beaten for over 12 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treatment of dissidents, real or suspected, includes women shot for refusing to comply with orders, sexually abused by security officers for failure to cover their hair, and imprisoned without charge or trial after peaceful demonstrations. When jailed, women have been physically abused, denied medical care and prevented access to family members, including nursing babies. n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Assassination Controversy Surrounds Angolan Rebel Leader</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year after a long-sought Angolan peace accord removed a contentious issue from the American foreign policy debate, Angola is again on the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonas Savimbi, the Angolan rebel leader who was able to attract not only the Reagan administration but also many Democrats to his cause, is back in the spotlight. This time, however, it is Savimbi who is under fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the forefront of the controversy are the executions late last year of two officials of Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita). Pedro &quot;Tito&quot; Chingunji and Wilson dos Santos, along with their wives and children, were killed reportedly after long confinement in Jamba, the southwestern Angolan town that served as Unita headquarters throughout the war. Chingunji's fate has been a particular source of concern to many people in Washington, after he was recalled as Unita's U.S. representative in 1988, amid indications that he was under suspicion at home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Unita's leadership repeatedly denied that Chingunji was undergoing anything other than a change of assignment -- a story Savimbi now concedes was a deliberate misrepresentation -- Chingunji was charged and convicted of plotting against Savimbi. His stature in Washington, where he is credited with winning Congressional backing for U.S. covert aid to Unita in 1985, apparently kept him alive until late 1991, when he and the others were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story has come to light now because of the defection from Unita in March of two of Savimbi's most trusted associates, Col. Tony da Costa Fernandes, a Unita co-founder and secretary for foreign relations, and Col.  Miguel N'zau Puna, the internal affairs secretary, who at one time was Unita secretary general and number two in the movement's hierarchy. The men say Savimbi was responsible for the recent deaths and for the elimination of many other potential challengers to his leadership. Unita, which conducted an internal investigation, says Puna instigated the killings to embarrass Savimbi and weaken his chances to win the presidency in the country's first free election, scheduled for September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the versions of what happened differ, they are consistent with earlier suspicions that Chingunji got into trouble for undertaking contacts with the Angolan government that could have resulted in a settlement less to Savimbi's liking than the 1991 accord. Diplomats involved in the U.S.-mediated talks between Angola, Cuba and South Africa said privately at the time that Chingunji was present &quot;around the edges&quot; of those sessions, taking part in unofficial, parallel deliberations aimed at resolving the internal Angolan conflict (see AfricaNews, February 6, 1989).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current controversy has reopened old divisions in Washington, where for nearly two decades Angola has been one of the hottest Cold War issues and Savimbi a favored anti-communist leader. Over the past seven years, Unita is believed to have received covert American assistance totaling $ 250 to $300 million for its war against the Soviet-supported Angolan government, which was backed by some 30,000 Cuban troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus far, the administration of President George Bush seems to be standing behind Savimbi, while emphasizing the importance of a smooth democratic process in Angola. But old-time Unita supporters on Capitol Hill are reexamining their stands. &quot;Because this nation has been identified by its support for Dr. Savimbi, we have a right to expect certain specific actions will be taken,&quot; Senators David Boren (D-OK) and Frank Murkowski (R-AL), the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a letter to President Bush earlier this month. The senators said Unita, along with the Angolan government, must abide by the peace accord, release all prisoners, and allow free movement and access to its territory for Angolans and international organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to knowledgeable sources on Capitol Hill, Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen, in private briefings, has sought to downplay the internal Unita problems and refocus congressional concern on Angolan government actions. The sources say Cohen has provided assurances that Washington has evidence supporting Unita's assertions that the defectors are in the pay of the Angolan government. He also is said to support Savimbi's claim that the Angolan government hatched a plot to kill him in Luanda in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following are excerpts from some of the most important pronouncements by the principal parties to the current controversy: (1) a statement in Washington by Fernandes and Puna, joined by Paulo Tjipilica, a long-time Unita central committee member and attorney who drafted the Unita constitution; and (2) Savimbi's response to Secretary of State James Baker's request for an explanation of the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Unita officials Tony Fernandes, Miguel N'zau Puna and Paulo Tjipilica, speaking at the National Press Club, May 13 --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We decided to separate ourselves from Savimbi's leadership because of his permanent intolerance of other people's ideas, his continued abuse of human rights even in peace time. But foremost, when we learned about the execution of our former colleagues Tito and Wilson, their wives and kids, we pledged to each other that we would find a way to expose the murders, the executions and other gross abuses of basic human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time we decided to work with other like-minded colleagues to transform Unita into a modern civilian party. For this purpose, we announce today that we are organizing the democratic tendency within Unita to discuss the party's leadership that has to be elected following a broad political debate on Unita's own strategy and political agenda. We call on all Angolans to be vigilant and accept no more the lies that have become the strategic behavior of the leader of Unita. The pains we went through during the past 17 years could never be understood by those who have sincerely believed in Unita and its leader. At one time it seemed that Savimbi was the best thing that could have ever happened to Angola at a time when the country was overtaken by Cuba and what was then called the Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We call on all people in Angola and abroad who want to see peace and democracy succeed in our country, to support our plea for an international investigation on what happened to Mr. Tito Chingunji and Mr. Wilson dos Santos, two Unita leaders who were opposed to Dr. Savimbi's dictatorial methods of leadership. The Angolan people, and indeed the international community want to know finally the whole truth about the human rights abuses within Savimbi-led Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Letter from Unita leader Jonas Savimbi to Secretary of State James Baker, dated March 31, 1992 --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May I say in the first place that I fear violations of human rights are an inevitable, though of course, regrettable part of any war. The rights of hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of Angolans to security of person, freedom of movement, freedom of expression and even, in some cases, to life itself, have been violated for decades past, particularly since the invasion of Angola by Cuban forces, the imposition of an unelected government and the commencement of civil war. We do not relish the part our forces have played in restricting and violating these rights of the people of Angola, although we remain convinced that the struggle for self-determination, and democratic expression which entailed such violations was necessary and morally wholly justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 1986 -- 87, we began to achieve real success in our efforts to ensure that our troops respected the rights of the people for whose liberation they were fighting. In retrospect, my erstwhile colleague, Miguel N'zau Puna, was a case where our efforts to persuade, rather than to discipline more harshly, were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1987 and 1988, Tito Chingunji, then a promising young leader, held a number of discussions with senior MPLA officials. (The MPLA is Angola's ruling party.) Some of these discussions were authorized by the Unita leadership, but it soon became clear that the MPLA's goal was to exclude me from the leadership of Unita and then to integrate members of Unita into MPLA on the basis of the government's &quot;clemency&quot; policy. Tito was instructed to stop the contacts. It later transpired that he continued to meet in secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In time the story emerged. Tito (who named Wilson as a co-conspirator) had become convinced that a deal could be struck with the MPLA if I were removed. He and a number of others had developed a plan to destroy my reputation, alleging, inter alia, human rights violations and drug use, in an attempt to create a climate enabling Tito to take over the presidency. The alternative plan was to poison me in Jamba and rally the youth (and later others) to his banner. What made the situation particularly delicate was that Tito alleged that his plan enjoyed the active backing of the CIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the nature of our dependence on the USA for assistance and the risk that disclosure of all this would severely damage our relationship with the administration, we decided to pretend that Tito had simply been reassigned to a new post. We could not disclose what he had done without placing the relationship at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was determined that no harm should come to these two young men, not because I did not believe that Tito's intention to kill me should go unpunished, but because I was convinced they could be re-habilitated. I persuaded the other members of the leadership, moreover, that if serious harm were to befall them, the international repercussions would be very damaging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had, in fact, intended to have the two young men meet Congressman (Dave) McCurdy (the Oklahoma Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee) and his delegation in Luanda early in January 1992. It may be that this prompted Puna to kill them so that it could not happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am deeply frustrated at the fact that the tragic circumstances of the deaths of Tito, Wilson and their families are obscuring the assassination plot initiated by the government. The pattern of espionage, bribery, planned assassination and coordinated disinformation revealed by this plot is a real threat to the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand the need to deal openly and completely with the allegations of human rights abuses and trust that you agree that this letter is a good faith effort to do just that. We shall cooperate with you in dealing appropriately with this matter and putting it behind us. We are wholly committed to the process of peace and democracy on which we jointly embarked. n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Africa-wide discussions held over the past year to formulate common perspectives and proposals for the Earth Summit, African non-governmental organizations (NGO) have been consulted much more extensively than just a year or two ago, says Peter Ngobese of Zimbabwe Environmental Research Organization (Zero), a Zimbabwean NGO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental sustainability should not just mean conservation of the physical environment, but also the sustainability of human resources, argue Zero and another NGO, Environment and Development Activities -- Zimbabwe.  &quot;There must be enough jobs, land, food and energy to meet people's basic needs while still sustaining the environment,&quot; they say in their report, The State of the Environment: Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A particular problem facing the Zimbabwean people is &quot;the inequitable entitlements to natural resources&quot; resulting from colonial policies that allocated land along racial lines. In the communal land areas, where a large portion of the rural population was confined, overutilization has contributed to severe soil erosion and deforestation. The rural poor therefore need &quot;security of tenure and access to resources&quot; if the cycle of poverty and environmental degradation is to be broken, say the two NGOs. They criticize the Zimbabwe government's structural adjustment program which, by reducing funding to environmental programs, &quot;has institutionally marginalized environmental issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team (Nest) has similarly argued that some of that country's economic and development policies, associated with the rigors of structural adjustment and high debt-servicing obligations, have exacerbated pressures on the Nigerian environment. Besides incurring severe social costs, the economic austerity programs have &quot;greatly encouraged mineral production and natural resources exploitation to secure much-needed foreign exchange,&quot; worsening the depletion of timber stocks, land degradation and other problems, argues Nest in its Unced report, The Path to Sustainable Development in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental degradation can, in turn, bring serious economic losses, the Nigerian group says. Citing World Bank estimates, it reports that environmental losses cost Nigeria roughly $ 5 billion a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of these problems hit ordinary Nigerians the hardest, the report says. In addition, because of the enormous number of tasks carried out by women, environmental degradation has a &quot;gender bias,&quot; imposing on women a heavier burden than on men. Nest argues forcefully that popular participation in forming environmental and development policies needs to be greatly strengthened.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries are working to ensure that their concerns about desertification, poverty and other development problems facing the continent are given high priority at the &quot;Earth Summit&quot; in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, June 3-14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In negotiations leading up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Unced), African representatives have been arguing forcefully that the continent's particular concerns should not be overlooked amid all the attention devoted to more global environmental problems such as climate change, ozone depletion and deforestation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the majority of African countries daily confronted with the problems of thirst and hunger,&quot; says Burkina Faso's minister of environment and tourism, Mihyemba Ouali, &quot;the struggle against environmental degradation is a struggle for survival. For us, the problem of environmental protection is a problem of development, a problem of the sustainable management of natural resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar themes were emphasized by many other African delegates who participated in the various rounds of formal and informal negotiations preceding the summit, which is shaping up to be the broadest and highest-level international conference yet held on environmental issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several key documents expected to be signed by heads of state going to Rio were tentatively approved in early April, at the close of a five-week round of preparatory negotiations at UN headquarters in New York. The &quot;Rio Declaration on Environment and Development&quot; outlines a general set of principles, while &quot;Agenda 21&quot; provides a detailed and comprehensive plan of action, extending into the twenty first century and spanning such broad areas as land degradation, poverty, forests, international trade, demographic pressures and toxic waste disposal. A draft convention on climate change has been negotiated, obliging industrialized countries to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and other &quot;greenhouse&quot; gases (although without any specific timetables, which were opposed by the U.S.). Talks have been taking place in Nairobi, Kenya, on a similar convention to protect the world's biological diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most donor countries have been reluctant to make specific financial commitments to back up their general pledges, they have nevertheless conceded that Africa and other developing regions will require &quot;new and additional resources&quot; if Agenda 21's ambitious programs are to be carried out.  Some, such as Norway's minister of development cooperation, Grete Faremo, argue that &quot;Africa deserves special attention in the process,&quot; given the severity of its environmental and development problems and its extremely limited financial capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African governments believe their people have the &quot;legitimate rights&quot; to health, development and a healthy environment, declared Cote d'Ivoire's minister of environment, Ezan Akele, in presenting the &quot;African Common Position on Environment and Development&quot; to the preparatory meetings in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While recognizing that Africa's commitment to sustainable development &quot;calls for the use of our own resources in new and innovative ways,&quot; Africa nevertheless needs additional assistance from its development partners, E.O.A.  Aina, director of Nigeria's Federal Environmental Protection Agency, told a March 29-30 meeting on the &quot;African Common Position,&quot; sponsored by the UN Department of Economic and Social Development and the Washington-based Global Coalition for Africa. This assistance, Aina says, should include substantial debt relief as well as additional resources for the implementation of Agenda 21 programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar points were stressed by Guinea-Bissau's minister of rural development and agriculture, Mario Cabral, and Gabon's minister of tourism and environment, Pepin Mongockodji. Cabral warns the developed countries that no &quot;oasis of prosperity&quot; can last forever if it is &quot;surrounded by increasing poverty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Developing countries can either develop through the same environmentally damaging methods used by countries in the North, argues Senegal's minister of tourism and environmental protection, Jacques Baudin, or they can develop on a more sustainable basis, using new environmentally friendly technologies. These, however, cost more than most African countries can afford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African delegates acknowledge Africa's responsibility to also help resolve global environmental problems and preserve humanity's &quot;common heritage.&quot; Ouali warns, however, that under conditions of poverty and illiteracy, environmental protection often takes a back seat to more immediate concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you manage resources sustainably in a situation where there is massive poverty, where there is no development?&quot; asks Peter Ngobese, environmental program director of the Zimbabwe Environmental Research Organization (Zero), a regional network of environmental experts actively involved in the African consultations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of poverty was also highlighted by Unced Secretary-General Maurice Strong, in a special message to an April meeting of African leaders in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, representing the member countries of the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel. &quot;Poverty is at once a major source and a result of the deterioration of the environment,&quot; Strong stressed. &quot;This reinforces the moral, humanitarian and social justification for granting priority to the fight to eradicate poverty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems of drought and desertification -- the spread of deserts -- threatens livelihoods and economic development in many African countries and featured prominently at the Ouagadougou meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to recent estimates by the Nairobi-based UN Environment Program (Unep), nearly three-quarters of Africa's drylands -- which themselves comprise more than half the continent's total land area -- are now affected by moderate to very severe degrees of desertification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the most recent round of preparatory meetings for the Unced summit, however, desertification received only limited attention, despite efforts by African delegations to press the issue. Some donor countries suggest that problems of land degradation could best be addressed through national plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This contrasts with the considerable international concern expressed over deforestation. Since tropical forests help absorb excess carbon dioxide (80% of which is emitted by industrialized countries), their preservation has been seen as a key line of defense against severe climatic change resulting from global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, African delegates point to the inconsistency of not considering desertification in a similar light. Mali's minister of agriculture and environment, Sy Maimouna Ba, argues that desertification deserves a high international priority, since its causes and consequences also are related to global warming. &quot;Where do we draw a distinction between global and local environmental problems?&quot; she asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the aim of focusing African and international efforts on establishing &quot;green belts&quot; of trees north and south of the Sahara and around the Kalahari Desert, an international convention to combat desertification was proposed at a November 1991 meeting in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, where African environment and development ministers drafted the &quot;African Common Position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the recent preparatory meetings in New York, African position delegates again pressed their case against the creeping expansion of the deserts. This time, their position gained wide support, including support from the European Community. But further action on a possible convention on desertification is not expected until after the Rio summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agenda 21 itself was amended at the initiative of the African group of negotiators in order to strengthen those portions dealing with desertification and drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendments put a greater stress on popular participation in environmental education, the role of women, the strengthening of national and regional capacities for gathering and analyzing environmental data, eradicating poverty and developing alternative livelihoods for people affected by desertification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African group estimates the cost of the latter undertaking alone at some $ 3 billion a year for all developing countries, while the projected financing required for programs related more directly to desertification, land degradation and reforestation has been put by Unced at an additional $ 6.5 billion a year, nearly half of which would need to come from external sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such financing requests will face much competition in Rio. According to Maurice Strong the estimated total external concessional funding needed to implement all the programs encompassed by Agenda 21 would reach $ 125 billion a year, $ 70 billion a year more than current development aid levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I realize that under today's conditions, this is not politically realistic,&quot; Strong acknowledges. But he says he hopes that the Earth Summit will bring an initial commitment of at least &quot;several billion dollars&quot; per year in additional financing for Agenda 21 and for the separate conventions on climate change and biodiversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F.L. Schlingemann, head of the Netherlands's Environment Program, told a Global Coalition for Africa meeting in March that if all donor countries raised their aid allocations to 0.7% of gross national product, as recommended by the UN, much of the additional resources needed for Agenda 21 would become available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Schiele of the U.S. Mission to the UN told the same meeting that the U.S. &quot;will do what we can to help Africa,&quot; through increasing traditional aid programs or by more innovative methods involving the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The channels or mechanisms for the disbursement of any additional funding that might materialize was a matter of some debate during the Unced preparatory meeting. The developing countries' Group of 77 proposed a new &quot;Green Fund&quot; to complement Agenda 21, a call that was reiterated at an April meeting of the group in Malaysia. Others, particularly from the donor side, suggested that the Global Environment Facility (GEF), established in late 1990, could be a suitable instrument for enhanced environmental funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administered by the World Bank and overseen jointly with the UN Development Program and Unep, the GEF currently has resources to commit about $ 1 billion in grants and technical assistance for projects related to ozone depletion, global warming, biodiversity and the pollution of international waters. Its first loan, early this year, went to Poland for forest preservation, another loan has been approved for a renewable energy project in Zimbabwe and several more loans are under consideration for Africa. However, many non-governmental organizations and developing countries have questioned the World Bank's predominance in GEF, however, given what they see as the bank's mixed record on environmental issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to such criticisms, GEF Chairman Mohamed el-Ashry announced at a May 1 news conference in Washington, D, that the facility would be restructured to broaden its membership and governing structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, skepticism remains. Referring to the severe conditions imposed on African and other developing countries by the World Bank through its &quot;structural adjustment&quot; loans, William Pace, director of the Center for Development of International Law, warns that the new GEF may try to impose similar &quot;political and structural conditions&quot; on countries seeking to use the facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maurice Strong suggests that additional environmental funding may be available through a variety of channels, alongside a modified GEF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recommends what he calls an &quot;earth increment&quot; in the current negotiations on replenishment of the World Bank's International Development Association, a proposal supported by the Nordic countries. Strong also proposes that new funding for the transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound technologies could in part be channeled through UNDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries have repeatedly signaled the importance of acquiring such new technologies. Their access is now hampered, however, by patents and other impediments, notes Abdelkader Gaid, director of environmental studies at Algeria's Secretariat of State for Scientific Research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries have also urged respect for their &quot;sovereignty&quot; over the continent's own biological resources. At a conference in Algiers in February they established a new African Agency for Biotechnology, which will try to strengthen African countries' capabilities in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the high costs associated with global environmental protection, African and other developing countries are anxious to ensure that the burden is not laid on the poorest countries but on those, primarily in the industrialized North, that are most responsible for environmental degradation.  The &quot;African Common Position&quot; affirms that &quot;we expect our partners in global environmental management for sustainable development to adopt the 'polluter pays principle' in ensuring that our participation is fruitful.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Vicki Finkel/Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's the news today?&quot; a British woman asks as she approaches a newspaper vendor on a war-battered street corner. &quot;Politics, politics, politics,&quot; he replies, &quot;nothing interesting at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But my friend, Angola will have elections soon and you must be informed so you can participate,&quot; she tells him. &quot;Why?&quot; he asks. &quot;We will all queue up and wait while the ministers and important people vote. Then we will be told that all the ballots are finished and there are none for us.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After decades of colonial rule and post-independence warfare, many Angolans share the vendor's skepticism about their country's first multiparty elections. The reaction is not surprising, says Jorge Chikote, leader of the Angolan Democratic Forum, one of some 30 newly- formed political parties. &quot;This country has always had dictatorship, people know nothing about multiparty democracy, and there is no education process going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many obstacles to the holding of elections, scheduled for September 29 and 30, in a country devastated by war with a population that is more than 80% illiterate. Chikote's Democratic Forum had argued that the problems were so massive that a five-year transition to democracy was required. But the shorter timetable is a central feature of the peace accord signed one year ago, ending a 16-year conflict between the government of President Eduardo Jose dos Santos, backed by the Soviet Union and Cuban troops, and Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita), supported by South Africa and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning has begun, as demonstrated by the banners and posters throughout this capital, but it is unclear how far electioneering is penetrating into the countryside. &quot;Most of the people cannot read or write and do not understand the elections,&quot; says Eusebio Faria from the state social welfare agency in the central province of Huambo. &quot;Peace is the significant thing to them now,&quot; she says -- &quot;the fact that they can return to their homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as election day grows nearer, it seems likely that the chance to cast a vote may become more real for many Angolans. In fact, the widely felt desire for peace could provide an impetus for the balloting that would help offset the difficulties. &quot;It will be a mess, but the election will have to take place,&quot; one senior United Nations official says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections are the cornerstone of the peace accord, which designates an important role in the process for the United Nations. The UN's previous involvement in election monitoring in this region -- overseeing Namibia's pre-independence elections two years ago -- was considered a big success. But the UN budget for advice, preparation, implementation and monitoring in Angola is only one-quarter of what it was in Namibia, whose population is one-tenth of Angola's 10 million. The UN electoral mission &quot;will be an operation limited in scale,&quot; UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a recent report, similar to observer missions sent to Nicaragua and Haiti in recent years. He said that 400 international monitors are to be fielded by the UN during the polling. Another 350 may be provided by various non-governmental organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The national government is responsible for the elections,&quot; says Margaret Anstee, the UN special representative in Angola. &quot;We are here to help provide technical assistance.&quot; A UN team is already in Angola, working with a newly formed National Electoral Commission charged with overseeing the entire election process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With so much to do before election day, the government's delay in establishing the commission drew criticism not only from Unita but also from independent observers. But the new body seems to be trying to make up for lost time by plunging ahead this month with its first major undertaking, the registration of voters. This will put the peace plan to a test, since registrars will have to contend with blown-out bridges, ravaged road and communications systems, the danger of widespread land mines and a critical shortage of fuel and transport vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a daunting task, and we have real concerns about the government's capacity under the time restraints, says Tom White, the chief UN administrative officer here. White estimates that half the registration process will have to be done with air transport and that about 100 helicopters will be required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort to remove the thousands of deadly land mines littering the rural countryside has begun with South African and British assistance, but only limited headway has been made, and the task cannot be completed before the voting begins. In addition, some 400,000 Angolans must be repatriated from neighboring countries, a process that has not yet begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election law stipulates that voter registration can only take place in areas under government authority. But this poses a potentially serious obstacle to the process, since Luanda's administration has not been extended to Unita strongholds in southern Angola. Similar problems are posed in Cabinda, an oil-rich enclave to the north, where the separatist Front for the Liberation of Cabinda continues to launch periodic attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace accord mandates that a national army be established before the voting, but both sides continue to exchange charges of cease-fire violations and no progress has been made towards unification of the two formerly adversarial forces. Weapons are prolific, and the level of crime and banditry throughout the country has risen sharply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the difficulties, there is no talk of changing the timetable, which was one of the most contentious issues in the negotiations. International observers expect to complete the process even though they know that shortcomings will occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This cannot be a perfect election,&quot; says the UN's Anstee. &quot;It will have to be free and fair with the best results possible, but we cannot expect it to be what it would be in a more organized society with a long history of democracy and tranquillity.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African countries are the poorest, most troubled, least developed and hungriest in the world, according to a group of recently released reports.  Rankings from the World Bank, the U.S.-based Population Crisis Committee, the United Nations Development Program and the U.S. Agency for International Development list large numbers of African nations at or near the bottom in income levels, ability to feed themselves and quality of life:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* African countries account for more than 90% (23 of 26) of the most severely indebted nations in the world, according to the World Bank's World Development Report 1992. African countries account for more than 60% (33 of 51) of what the Bank calls &quot;low-income&quot; nations, the poorest in the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* African countries account for more than 66% (20 of 27) of nations the Population Crisis Committee (PCC) places in the &quot;extreme human suffering&quot; category and more than 40% (24 of 56) of countries in the &quot;high human suffering&quot; category. The rankings, published this month in the committee's International Human Suffering Index, stem from measurements of health, income, inflation, secondary school enrollment, the number of telephones, and political and civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambique heads the &quot;extreme&quot; category, meaning its population endures the greatest level of suffering in the world. The southeast African nation has the world's lowest per capita gross national product ($ 80 a year) and the lowest average daily calorie supply (76 percent of needed calories).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somalia is listed just below Mozambique in the &quot;extreme&quot; category, and Sudan shares third place with two non-African countries, Afghanistan and Haiti, followed by Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rapid population growth, economic decline and internal political conflicts are responsible for much of the suffering, according to PCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* African countries account for 66% (44 of 65) of the nations in the &quot;low human development&quot; category of the United Nations Development Program's Human Development Index, according to the Human Development Report 1992. The rankings are based on life expectancy, literacy and years of schooling, and gross domestic product. African countries occupy 18 of the top 20 places and nine of the top ten. Guinea is at the top of the list, and Sierra Leone is second. Afghanistan is listed third, Burkina Faso is fourth, followed by Niger, Mali, the Gambia, Djibouti, Guinea-Bissau and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* African countries account for 75% (15 of 20) of the world's hungriest nations, according to the Agency for International Development's Food Security Index, issued in late 1991. Mozambique, followed by Somalia, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone and Chad were ranked worst according to the index, which is based on 1986-88 statistics for domestic food production, gross foreign exchange earnings, gross national product, daily calorie supply and child mortality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, sand dunes were moving into Niger's Keita Valley, near the northwest border of Nigeria. The dry land was cut by crevasses dug by the runoff of vanished rains. The wind carried away soil. The few remaining trees were losing their leaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The desert was rock,&quot; said Maurizio Malogioglio, senior program officer in the development department of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). &quot;The people in the villages would have left in 1984 to '85, except for the nomads who can get by on just a little grass.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some 156,000 people in 200 villages spread across 960 square miles (600 square kilometers) did not leave, thanks to their own hard work and an FAO program to reclaim the land. Led by women, the villagers abandoned the traditional practice of shifting cultivation, in which people moved from place to place every few seasons, clearing trees from new plots. With fertile land scarce, they began farming on permanent plots using new techniques: mixing millet with cowpeas, which fixes nitrogen in the soil; applying some artificial fertilizer; and &quot;water harvesting,&quot; or building ditches to catch runoff and divert it into fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The benefits came with the first harvest -- and continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's become a green valley,&quot; Malogioglio said. &quot;It's amazing. You see acres and acres of plants and crops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the same time the Keita Valley was coming back to life, land in other parts of Africa was dying, losing its productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Global Assessment of Soil Degradation, released in March by the United Nations, says that 321 million hectares of the continent, 14 percent of vegetated land, suffered &quot;moderate, severe or extreme degradation&quot; between 1945 and 1990; 46% of the damage is water erosion in sub-Saharan Africa, and 38% is wind erosion north and south of the Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assessment report, sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program as the first worldwide study of damage to the soil, ranked the two major causes in Africa as follows: 49% due to overgrazing, most serious in the Sahel and southern Africa, and 24% due to poor agricultural practices, such as not letting land recover long enough between periods of farming, failing to use adequate fertilizer on nutrient-poor soil, cultivating hillsides without erosion controls, and mismanaging irrigation systems so the ground becomes waterlogged or laced with salt. Deforestation accounted for another 14% of the damage and stripping land of wood for fuel for the other 13%, according to the study, published in World Resources 1992-93.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The destruction of fertile soil occurred while African farmers were falling behind in the race with population growth. Food production on the continent rose about 40% between 1970 and 1990, but per capita food production fell by about 20% during the same period, according to FAO figures cited in the World Resources Institute's annual report on the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All but a small portion of the 791 million acres in Africa damaged between 1945 and 1990 can be reclaimed, according to the Global Assessment report, just as Keita Valley was. But doing so requires money and expertise beyond what the individual farmer can provide, and in the case of severe degradation, resources needed to reverse the damage exceed what developing nations -- already hard-pressed economically -- can muster, according to the World Resources report. Plots must be terraced and banks built along contours to stop erosion, ditches must be dug to drain fields, and land must be deep plowed and reseeded to restore its fertility after trampling by animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restoring the damaged land is not enough. Future destruction must be prevented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's population, at 642 million in 1990, is expected to double by 2015 and reach almost 1.6 billion by 2025, according to UN figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As populations rise, there are not only more mouths to feed, there are also fewer acres available per person. Traditional shifting cultivation requires letting land lie fallow for years. Farmers face pressure to either return too soon to fertile land or to move onto vacant land that is less fertile and easily damaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can Africa restore and protect its soil? The World Resources report, Worldwatch publications, and Africa in Crisis, a book by Lloyd Timberlake, editorial director of the environmental group Earthscan, give plenty of simple but effective answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments, the environmentalists say, must manage farmland on a regional and long-term basis and commit themselves to larger social changes, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* lowering the rate of population growth;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* giving farmers produce prices and marketing opportunities that create incentive and ability to invest in the land;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* ending preferences for export crop farming, which often leads to overcultivation and pushes farmers growing food onto marginal soil and herders onto evenmore easily damaged land;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* abandoning programs to settle herders, efforts that often lead to overgrazing;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* adopting the best of African farming techniques, which are adapted to the continent's poor soils and irregular rains, and combining these with methods developed by researchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter tactic often requires development organizations and aid donors to rethink their approach to agricultural assistance. Too often, Timberlake and other specialists say, the knowledge and skills gathered by the continent's farmers over centuries have been ignored by well-educated foreigners whose own ideas often prove unworkable under African conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only truly new development of the last couple of decades is agroforestry -- growing crops with trees that secure the land, produce leaves for fertilizer or animal feed and otherwise benefit nearby plants and the soil, says Alan Yates, a senior agriculturalist at the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FAO is promoting a return to &quot;the bread and butter, no fancy techniques&quot; in Africa, says Wim G. Sombroek, director of the Land and Water Conservation and Development Division. The integrated approaches to land management the FAO supports, like Keita Valley, combine agroforestry, planting crops that fix nitrogen in the soil, applying manure and some artificial fertilizer, improving water use and providing credit for small farmers. Eight countries so far have agreed to participate in the FAO's International Scheme for the Rehabilitation and Conservation of African Lands, launched in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Soil conservation in Africa has been on the decline,&quot; Sombroek said.  &quot;Now it's catching on again.&quot;n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Reed Kramer * Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. government often has been in the forefront of humanitarian efforts to relieve suffering around the world. But State Department aides drawing up an advisory memorandum last month for Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger on the unfolding southern African drought were told to omit any reference to a need for increased U.S. assistance. Only a &quot;reprogramming&quot; of already approved aid to combat the expected human tragedy would be considered by the State Department's upper echelon, the aides were told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when the United Nations in April was deciding how to reinforce a fragile truce between warring parties in Somalia and get food and medicine to thousands of desperate residents of the Somali capital, the U.S. balked at a proposal to dispatch 500 armed troops to protect relief workers. Overriding the recommendations of officials involved in the crisis, the administration decided that a $ 7 million U.S. share for the operation might spark criticism from Congress, where the rising price tag for UN peacekeeping operations has provoked opposition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of U.S. policy argue that the U.S. has a special responsibility to promote peace and democracy in Africa, because of a long history of doing the opposite. It is significant, the critics say, that of the six largest recipients of American aid to sub-Saharan Africa in the last 35 years -- Sudan, Zaire, Liberia, Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia -- all are gripped by violent internal conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timothy Njoya, a Presbyterian pastor from Kenya who has been visiting the U.S. this month to seek support for his country's democracy movement, says the continent's most deadly conflicts are legacies of the Cold War, which built stockpiles of armaments that are now being used by rival groups against each other or by governments resisting democratic reforms. &quot;The American arms that have been given to Africa are being used by authoritarian rulers to kill their critics,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Cold War rivalry no longer driving competition for influence, and with foreign affairs pushed off this year's political agenda, African issues rarely receive notice in Washington policy circles. Attention from the administration's top policymakers is generally limited to a lingering interest in issues that compelled attention in the Cold War era Q the transition from apartheid in South Africa, Angola's peace process and the fate of longtime U.S. ally Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also is little time for Africa among lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interest is generally limited to a few members in each house who write letters, sponsor resolutions or attend hearings, generally with the aim of pressing the administration into action on a humanitarian or human rights concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the U.S. as the only remaining world superpower, the consequences of disinterest can be very high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;failure of leadership by the U.S.&quot; in the Somalia crisis, the human rights monitoring group Africa Watch has charged, contributed to massive ongoing suffering in that East African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somalia is a place where a little action could have made a big difference,&quot; says Rakiya Omaar, Africa Watch's executive director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. today occupies a position of unprecedented leadership in the world,&quot; says Olara Otunnu, a former Ugandan foreign minister who now heads the New York-based International Peace Academy, a nongovernmental organization involved in conflict resolution around the globe. &quot;A quiet word from Washington, a little bit of aid here or there -- this can be crucial in so many situations,&quot; he says. &quot;As a result, the absence of U.S. action carries with it a heavy burden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Herman ('Hank') Cohen, the U.S. is meeting the challenge reasonably well. &quot;It can be difficult,&quot; he concedes. &quot;There's just not enough money to take care of every tragedy, but I think our record has been pretty good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month the U.S. pledged about $ 380 million for the southern African drought -- much of it re-allocated from funds and food that had been earmarked for projected winter shortages in the former Soviet Union that never occurred -- and led a campaign to win additional support from other major donors. In addition, stepped-up U.S. pressure on the Somali factions in recent weeks is said by many observers to have contributed to the success of the UN-mediated cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics believe the U.S. could be doing far more -- and at little cost. &quot;The Bush administration has failed to provide any leadership on African issues,&quot; says Michael Clough, who for the past five years has been senior fellow for Africa at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. The end of the Cold War created an opening &quot;to develop a new relationship with Africa,&quot; Clough writes in a recently published examination of U.S. Africa policy, Free At Last? -- but the opportunity has been squandered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Neither the president nor any of his senior foreign policy advisors has displayed any real interest in the continent,&quot; Clough argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says that middle level officials charged with running Africa policy operate &quot;with considerable latitude&quot; but must follow three injunctions: &quot;Don't spend much money. Don't take stands that might create domestic controversies.  Don't let Africa complicate policy toward other, more important parts of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the administration's point man for Africa, the State Department's Cohen has been called upon to lead the response to the sea change which has taken place in Africa during President Bush's term in office. During the past two years, on a scale unmatched anywhere else in the world, most of Africa's 55 nations have moved rapidly toward political pluralism and toward adoption of free market economic policies that Washington has been advocating for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We Americans who have been saying that Africans must democratize and must reform their economies must now give support to the changes,&quot; Cohen said in a recent interview. &quot;The end of the Cold War allows us to do things we couldn't do before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Cohen's direction and with congressional prodding, the administration has developed a policy of using aid flows to encourage democratic change. A substantial part of the annual $ 800 million U.S. aid package for Africa is being earmarked for countries making political and economic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want to be too rigid -- and above all, we don't want to require that African governments copy the U.S. system,&quot; Cohen says. But U.S.  aid in the future will go to those governments that &quot;embrace free speech, allow for greater participation by their citizenry,&quot; and demand accountability from government structures to minimize corruption and waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quiet-spoken, 60-year-old diplomat who spent most of his career working on or serving in Africa, Cohen has won high marks for an earnest and disarmingly open approach to his job. In frequent appearances on Capitol Hill, he has received praise from both Democratic and Republican members, even when they have been critical of various aspects of administration policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen has appeared on many platforms to discuss Africa throughout the U.S., and he has traveled extensively in Africa. The result, he says, is that African leaders &quot;feel their concerns are taken seriously&quot; by Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the eyes of the Africans, we are not a declining power,&quot; he says.  &quot;They see us generally as impartial and they want us to be part of their solutions.&quot; Cohen cites U.S. mediation in Angola and Ethiopia as examples of successful interventions that helped end decade-long conflicts. &quot;We made an effort in the Sudan, which didn't work, but we felt like we gave it the good college try,&quot; he says. The U.S. also has been playing a role in Mozambique peace talks and has been asked to take part in negotiations between the Rwandan government and the rebel movement known as the Rwandan Patriotic Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Africa is a low foreign policy priority has worked to Cohen's advantage, many Africa policy observers believe. &quot;Unlike China, for which the president serves as his own desk officer, on Africa Hank Cohen has a relatively free hand,&quot; says Les Janka, a member of the National Security Council staff under Presidents Reagan, Ford and Nixon who is now executive vice president of Neill and Company, a Washington, DC public relations firm representing a number of African clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Cohen rejects the notion that he is a free agent. &quot;I don't consult the secretary of State on a daily basis, but I work under his broad guidelines,&quot; he says. &quot;Support for democracy was his idea, and support for economic reform was something he was promoting as secretary of the Treasury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State James Baker III has directed Cohen to &quot;follow South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa &quot; and to &quot;try to make sure all the work we have done in Angola leads to a free and fair election,&quot; Cohen says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beyond that, I do make the day-to-day decisions and I think I've made the administration look good.&quot; good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late March, Baker suddenly reinvolved himself in Angola, which during the Reagan presidency and early Bush years was a pressing Cold War concern. Amid mounting allegations of serious human rights abuses by Jonas Savimbi, the Angolan rebel leader and recipient of large-scale U.S. covert aid during the past eight years, Baker dashed off a letter demanding a &quot;full explanation&quot; of charges that Savimbi was responsible for the deaths of several former top aides. After Savimbi's reply was received (see AfricaNews, May 25- June 7, 1992), Cohen was dispatched to Angola to talk over the matter with Savimbi firsthand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials on the State Department's seventh floor, where Baker and his senior aides have their offices, say Cohen enjoys Baker's backing, even though meetings between the two are rare, as they are with all but the secretary's closest inner circle. &quot;With the exception of Zaire, I can't think of any place recently where Baker and the White House have bothered to give direction to a policy issue on Africa,&quot; one well-placed official says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official was referring to discussions in March at Camp David, the presidential retreat, over the wording of a letter from President Bush to President Mobutu, calling upon the Zaire leader to reopen his country's national conference, a meeting of political, civic and religious leaders that had been debating Zaire's political future until it was suspended on January 19 by the government. In the letter, Bush appealed to Mobutu to exercise leadership and &quot;assure a transition to democracy which can inspire the confidence of all parties,&quot; one official says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in Zaire attracted White House notice because of the history of close relations with Mobutu, a staunch Cold War ally whose country served as the base for U.S. covert activities in Angola and other parts of Africa, and because of longstanding personal ties between the Zaire leader and senior American officials, including Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to see a transitional government take full charge of the government and run everything,&quot; Cohen says. Mobutu should remain as &quot;titular president,&quot; to provide &quot;a sense of security&quot; to the elements of the army &quot;to make sure they don't go wild and engage in destructive acts like in Somalia.&quot; Bush's letter had the desired effect, Cohen says: Mobutu agreed to let the national conference resume in early April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many outside the administration believe the U.S. could play a more influential role in forcing Mobutu to relinquish power and avert economic disaster and widespread civil unrest. Calls for an end to all U.S. ties with Mobutu have been voiced by such leading members of Congress as Kansas Republican Nancy Kassebaum, the ranking minority member of the Senate Africa subcommittee, and Oklahoma Democrat David Boren, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. However, the president and other top officials have determined that, for the moment, the current posture will stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The costly political stalemate in Zaire is one of many indications that Africa &quot;is still reaping the bitter harvest of the Cold War,&quot; says Martin Lowenkopf, a former State Department intelligence analyst. Four of the largest U.S. aid recipients in sub-Saharan Africa in the post-World War II period -- Sudan, Liberia, Somalia, and Ethiopia -- remain embroiled in devastating civil wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing of Liberia in a recent issue of CSIS Africa Notes, published by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, Lowenkopf says that the late President Samuel K. Doe &quot;would not have lasted as long, stirred up so much hatred and desperation, or developed the kind of security apparatus that compounded and prolonged the violence that eventually led to his downfall in 1990, had the United States not provided material support and political acceptance for 10 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration defenders say that recent events in Kenya demonstrate how aid can be a force for change. After resisting persistent domestic demands for democratization, President Daniel arap Moi caved in to concerted donor pressure and &quot;the democratization process in Kenya is now irreversible,&quot; Cohen says. In discussions with Moi in Nairobi last month, Cohen raised the issue of Kenya's &quot;history of rigged elections&quot; and &quot;how to make this one free and fair.&quot; Moi said he was willing to have election observers from the Commonwealth, made up of Britain and its former colonies, Cohen says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Free At Last? Clough recommends &quot;principled nonintervention&quot; as the major tenant of a new Africa policy, with all aid tied to human rights adherence, no funds going to political candidates or parties, and at least half of all assistance channeled through nongovernmental organizations. He also calls for increased interaction between American and African citizens and institutions like universities, which he argues could &quot;make a significant difference in the way Americans relate to Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One effort already underway to promote ties between Africa and a variety of U.S. groups, predominantly those involving African Americans, is the Constituency for Africa, spearheaded by the Washington-based development organization, Africare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen and other administration officials have emphasized growing opportunities for American business to get involved in Africa. &quot;Only you, with your ability to create wealth, can help lead Africa out of poverty,&quot; Cohen told business leaders attending a trade and investment conference in Seattle last month. &quot;There is money to be made, and when you succeed, Africa succeeds as well,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many voices advocating what Otunnu of the International Peace Academy calls &quot;a positive U.S. re-engagement in Africa in the area of peacemaking.&quot; The lead needs to be taken by Africans themselves, Otunnu says, &quot;but the U.S. has a very important role to play.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the administration, some officials believe there is a pressing need for a re-examination of U.S. policy, particularly with regard to conflict resolution. &quot;With all the changes that are taking place, we think this would be a good time for a policy review,&quot; one official says. &quot;But politically, it may be awkward -- there's no real interest in tackling something like this on Africa right now.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

A separate event, a giant birthday party, is being readied by Rastafarians, who are named for the feudal ruler and believe he is the living God.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haile Selassie, which means &quot;Mighty of the Trinity,&quot; held the name Ras Tafari as a young prince, before he was crowned emperor in 1930. Royalists believe he was the 225th in an unbroken line of kings that began with Menelik I, son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1975, a year after a military coup deposed Selassie, the new government, led by Mengistu Haile Mariam, announced that the 83-year-old former emperor had died of natural causes while in detention. Royalists contend Mengistu and other military officers suffocated the emperor with an ether-soaked pillow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A body tentatively identified as Selassie's was removed in February from a grave beneath a latrine in the old Imperial Palace. Members of the royal family have invited heads of state to attend a ceremony during which the body will be placed in a mausoleum in Addis Ababa's Trinity Cathedral.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talks are focussing on achieving a cease-fire and developing procedures for future negotiations, according to a Rwanda Radio interview with Foreign Minister Boniface Ngulinzira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some government soldiers this is not welcome news.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 27 people died when troops looted shops and homes in the northwestern towns of Gisneyi and Ruhengeri. Once order was restored, Defense Minister James Gasana and the heads of the army and police assured the soldiers they would not be demobilized. But soldiers later ransacked homes and businesses in two western towns and in the nation's second largest city, Butare, in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About three-quarters of the army's 40,000 members are believed to have been recruited since the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RDF) invaded from Uganda in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in neighboring Burundi, a majority of the population is from the Hutu ethnic group. But unlike Burundi, where the minority Tutsi control the government, Rwanda's Hutu group has been in power since a 1959 uprising against Tutsi dominance. Most rebels in Rwanda are members of the ousted Tutsi group</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Amnesty International report released June 4 says Hutu security forces executed more than 1,000 Tutsis without trial during the months following the rebel invasion, in retaliation for RDF killings of prisoners and civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RDF wants the government to allow Tutsi refugees to return to Rwanda from Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire; asks that rebels be integrated into the country's army; and demands democratic reforms. Early this month in Brussels, the rebel group joined legal opposition parties in a statement accusing President Juvenal Habyarimana of opposing peace and democracy and calling for his removal from office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Habyarimana's opponents accuse his regime of being behind a series of bombings that have killed or wounded dozens since March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its part, the government is offering to give all Rwandan citizens diplomatic protection and passports immediately, to distribute identity cards that do not name the holder's ethnic group, and to investigate human rights abuses, the Rwandan minister of works and social affairs said in a May 26 Radio Rwanda broadcast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting between the government and rebels fell off in advance of the talks, but was heavy during May. RDF members say they killed 1,000 government soldiers last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the latest casualties in the civil war was Mrithi, a 400-pound male mountain gorilla, well-known to tourists and animal researchers such as Dian Fossey. The 23-year-old silverback was found dead in his nest, apparently killed when either rebel or government fighters mistook a group of gorillas for the enemy. Mrithi was the first member of the endangered species killed in the conflict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government spokesman responded to the May report by saying rebels, who have been mounting anti-government attacks, caused the deaths.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a foreign ministry official says the government recognizes there were abuses and it has jailed some soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is asking for an inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London-based human rights organization says it gathered eyewitness accounts of 11 Roman Catholic seminary workers murdered by soldiers, of prisoners left to starve or clubbed to death, and of civilians killed with bayonets or grenades thrown into their homes. Earlier, the government said about 500 died in November and December and denied that executions without trial took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International says those summarily executed were Hutus suspected of supporting the rebels. Most rebels, who attacked parts of the northwest and the capital late in 1991, belong to the majority Hutu ethnic group. Most members of the army belong to the smaller but politically dominant Tutsi group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International also reports that security forces arrested hundreds of Hutus in addition to those killed. Some &quot;disappeared&quot; and some are still in custody without charge, the organization says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The transitional government of TOGO has postponed a referendum on a new constitution because of fighting in which at least 30 have died and 100 have been wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The referendum -- the first in a series of scheduled national votes designed to lead to democratic rule -- was to have taken place May 31, but was called off two days earlier, after conflict began in the central town of Sotouboua. At least 20 people died, 40 were wounded and 1,500 fled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Lome, the capital, a former government minister's house was ransacked and a grenade exploded at the home of another associate of President Gnassingbe Eyadema. The government has ordered anyone holding guns or ammunition without a permit to turn the weapons in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions are high between democracy movement supporters, concentrated in the more economically developed southern region, and people from Eyadema's home area in the north, who have been favored for government jobs and who make up most of the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An assassination attempt in early May that seriously wounded opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio and killed at least four others sparked a 72-hour general strike and demonstrations in Lome. Clashes in northern cities followed. At least one person died, streets were barricaded and buildings linked to Eyadema's political party were burned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyadema's supporters and opposition members are jockeying for power as the country prepares for its first multiparty elections in 24 years. A national conference in August 1991 led to the formation of a transitional government to replace one made up solely of members of Eyadema's ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olympio was expected to run for president against Eyadema. He is the son of former President Sylvanus Olympio, who was assassinated during the 1963 coup in which Eyadema came to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transitional President Joseph Kokou Koffigoh has promised an international investigation into last month's attempt on Gilchrist Olympio's life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By Kingsley Moghalu A combination of social upheavals, seemingly irreversible economic decline, and human rights violations by Nigeria's military government have combined to make life a daily nightmare for millions of Nigerians in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic riots in the south and sectarian fighting between Muslims and Christians in the northern city of Kaduna last month reveal the inability of President Ibrahim Babangida's government to contain a severe fiscal crisis and rising religious tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babangida's six-year-old economic austerity program has failed to achieve its objective of pulling the economy out of a slump caused by depressed prices of crude oil, on which Nigeria depends for 95% of its export earnings.  The recent protests have been sparked by increases in transport fares caused by gas shortages, which in turn were caused by the closure of the country's major refinery for maintenance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But beyond this immediate trigger, the riots reflect anger at the staggering inflation following the government's devaluation of Nigeria's currency, the naira, by 80% in March at the insistence of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discontent also is fueled by widespread corruption and a lack of public accountability by government. Tired of &quot;tightening their belts&quot; while the country's ruling military class wallows in luxury, Nigerians have lost patience with the once popular Babangida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One disturbing recent action was Babangida's gift of cars to thousands of Nigerian military officers, a gesture clearly meant to placate the soldiers and forestall a possible coup attempt. Nigerians are asking how these purchases were funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A unpublished World Bank report reveals that about $ 2 billion of unexpected oil revenues in 1990 -- a consequence of the Gulf War -- are unaccounted for.  In a thinly veiled reference to corruption, the report says that some $ 1.5 billion in revenues was allocated under ill-defined and poorly documented procedures outside the official accounting framework. These concerns have made the country's creditors unsympathetic to its pleas for substantial debt relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a further sign of current difficulties, the government is having problems reaching agreement with the IMF on a new financial package that is key to the country's ability to meet its foreign obligations. In an unusual step, the Fund dispatched a senior official, Momadu Torre, head of the Africa department, to Lagos last month for top level discussions. Technical talks now underway center on resolution of such problems as the continuing budgetary deficit and oil price subsidies, which not only depress government revenues but also encourage smuggling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent religious clashes in Kaduna, which claimed an estimated 500 lives, follows a long pattern of Muslim-Christian conflict. Tensions stem partly from a belief among Christians that Nigeria's leaders -- most of whom have hailed from the Muslim north -- have favored northern Islamic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The religious divide has become increasingly violent since 1986, when Babangida approved the secret admission of Nigeria into membership of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) without prior discussion in the Armed Forces Ruling Council, the country's highest governing body. The constitution declares Nigeria a secular state and Christians have felt threatened by their country's joining the international Islamic organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Nigerians believe that taking Nigeria into the OIC was the biggest political mistake of the Babangida presidency. Roughly 90% of the population is evenly divided into Islam and Christianity, with the remaining 10% adhering to traditional religions. There is speculation that the government has discreetly withdrawn from active participation in the OIC following protests by Christians, but the country's membership status in the organization remains unclear. Even so, as in some other countries, Nigeria is discovering that religious fires are much easier to start than to put out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights violations by the government have increased sharply in response to public criticism.  In addition to detaining and seizing the passports of human rights activists and lawyers, the government has leaned heavily on the press, forcing editors to tone down critical articles so their publications can remain on the newsstands. Recently, the news magazine African Concord was temporarily closed by the government for engaging in publications which Sam Oyouba, the information minister, said &quot;offend national security and national interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action against African Concord is seen as evidence of rising government intolerance for freedom of expression at a time when the military leaders are trying to steer the country to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerians note with interest that American media pay little attention to the pivotal events in Nigeria, in contrast, for example, to extensive newspaper and television reporting on similar events in Thailand.  It is hard for Nigerians to understand why Africa in general, and Nigeria in particular, which supplies large quantities of oil to the United States, is so ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's current crisis is seen as especially significant because it threatens the transition to democracy of Africa's most populous nation.  Nigerians fear they are watching the concoction of a familiar recipe for a military takeover attempt, if not against the Babangida regime, then almost certainly against the civilian government scheduled to assume power in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this uncertain situation, the human rights organization Africa Watch has cautioned Nigerians against expecting too much too soon from a new administration. &quot;Despite the bleak situation awaiting the new government,&quot; Africa Watch says, &quot;the only way that Nigerians can achieve their ultimate goal of democracy will be to be patient with the flawed government they will inherit and to work through democratic means to encourage a future in which stable, civilian governments succeed each other.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As South African political parties last month drew close to forming an interim government to guide the country toward free elections, New York City announced the imminent lifting of anti-apartheid sanctions imposed between 1985 and 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a second round of talks among South Africa's 19 political groups -- the Convention for a Democratic South Africa -- stalemated, putting New York's sanctions shift on hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Mayor David Dinkins had promised a &quot;significant&quot; reduction in the city's sanctions against South Africa, the toughest in the nation, if the talks established a multiparty executive council to prepare for elections in which blacks as well as whites could participate. He said he would make no changes until he received word from the African National Congress (ANC), the anti-apartheid organization that originally called for sanctions as a means of pressuring the government to end white rule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dinkins' announcement came after he received a letter from ANC President Nelson Mandela stating that as soon as an interim government was installed the group would issue a call to end sanctions. In New York, the measures include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a prohibition on city contracts with companies or banks with business ties to South Africa;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a policy of doing business with banks that have done the most to end the apartheid system; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a practice of avoiding investing the city's $ 43 billion pension funds in companies that do business in South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-apartheid sanctions by the federal government, states and municipalities cut the number of United States companies in South Africa to 110, from 360 in 1984, and reduced total American investment of $ 2.7 billion byabout two-thirds. The Bush administration ended most federal sanctions last year, but states and cities kept theirs to continue pressure for reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in May, the Congress of South African Trade Unions adopted a code of conduct for multinational companies that invest in South Africa once democracy is established. The code requires companies to create jobs, respect workers' rights, provide decent working conditions, protect the environment and use affirmative action programs to undo the legacy of apartheid.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pending disaster threatens to reverse a period of unparalleled change, including progress toward ending apartheid in South Africa; independence for Namibia; political and economic reforms in Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe; an end to decades of war in Angola; and hopes for peace in Mozambique.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A United Nations-sponsored donor conference at the beginning of the month produced pledges of more than $ 525 million in aid from some 50 nations and 15 international organizations. Jan Eliasson, UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, called the conference the most successful of it kind and expressed optimism that the additional $ 330 million in aid required would be forthcoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar aid appeal for the Horn of Africa in February so far has produced less than half the targeted $ 1.5 billion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The biggest offensive by the Sudanese government in nine years of civil war has overrun about a dozen towns and driven rebels into the southeastern corner of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even with their backs against the borders of Kenya and Uganda, the guerrillas of John Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) are continuing their struggle against a succession of authoritarian governments based in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As troops from the Islamic fundamentalist government advanced against the rebels last month, Khartoum hedged its bets by dispatching delegates to peace talks in Abuja, Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the two sides discussed the conflict in which thousands have died and more than a million have been forced from homes and farms, the shifting fighting has imperiled some 300,000 southerners who the United Nation's Operation Lifeline Sudan estimates are in desperate need of food and medicine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief organizations send most of their emergency aid to southern Sudan overland through northern Kenya and Uganda, the only feasible routes for delivering large amounts of supplies to much of the south. If the war forces relief organizations to operate solely out of Khartoum in the north, the flow of aid to the south will slow to a trickle, because supplies will have to be sent by barge down the White Nile, says Daniel Kelly, executive director of the Nairobi-based Association of Christian Resource Organizations Serving Sudan.  The government has denied aid groups permission to fly to most rebel-held areas since the dry season offensive started in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The May 27 capture of Kapoeta, a center for relief operations on the road from Kenya, cut the main overland route into southern Sudan, blocking humanitarian organizations' access to most territory east of the Nile, Kelly says. But Operation Lifeline has so far been able to reach parts of southern Sudan west of the Nile and some territory east of the river, including Garang's headquarters of Torit, using overland routes from Uganda, says Detlef Palm, Nairobi-based program coordinator for Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many reasons the government of Lt. Gen. Omar Ahmad Hassan al-Bashir has gained control over relief routes and the battlefield this dry season. Khartoum has benefited from:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* weapons Western diplomats say it bought with hundreds of millions of dollars received from Iran;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the overthrow in May 1991 of SPLA backer Ethiopian military ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a split in the rebel group last August that only began to heal early this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the SPLA guerrillas have a single powerful element on their side -- the weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rain that usually marks the end of the government's annual dry season offensive has begun falling already in southern Sudan. And, even if the dry season continues longer than usual, as appears likely, heavy rains almost certainly will make roads impassable by the end of June or early July, Palm says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rainy season, which continues through November, will leave government troops stranded on islands in the midst of the bush, controlled by the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As soon as the rains do come, the government troops will be in a vulnerable position,&quot; says a U.S. official in Washington, DC. &quot;How are they going to supply these towns? Southern Sudan is huge. You could take all of Vietnam and drop it into southern Sudan and it would disappear. It's not like you can take 20,000 troops and go in there and subdue it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garang has vowed the rebels will fight on, even if the government takes every town the SPLA holds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What the government is doing is entering towns and saying it has captured them, which is true,&quot; says Bona Malwal, a London-based Sudanese journalist who endorses the cause of the SPLA. &quot;But how much territory do these towns represent? I've never seen a guerrilla army defeated this way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rebels haven't fought any big battles and lost,&quot; the U.S.  official says. &quot;There's been fighting (only) in the sense that the rebels have been harassing convoys and inflicting a lot of casualties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think you can say there is a decisive victory by the government against the rebels,&quot; says Francis Deng, a former Sudanese foreign minister who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC. &quot;It's very easy to see these forces get back to the bush and continue fighting for years to come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the government succeeded on the battlefield, Sudan would not be rid of the deep religious, cultural and ethnic rift between north and south, fostered by the British in colonial days and widened in post-independence conflicts, Deng says. The north, which contains about four-fifths of Sudan's estimated 26 million people, is predominately Arab-speaking and Muslim. The government in recent years has imposed Sharia, or Islamic law, a move resisted by the black Africans in the south, who are predominately Christian and animist. Attempts to unify north and south by force will only fuel the anger that drives the rebels, Deng says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estimates of the troop strengths of the government and the SPLA vary.  The U.S. official says each side has between 10,000 and 30,000 troops in the south. One press report estimates government forces at 80,000 and the rebels at 40,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever their numbers, John Garang's faction of the SPLA, which contains 90% to 95% of the rebel troops, has been in retreat since the government began this year's offensive in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ethiopian rebels forced Mengistu Haile Mariam from power last year, the SPLA lost bases, a radio station and a source of military supplies.  Since the split in the SPLA, government troops have enjoyed free passage through territory held by the breakaway &quot;Nasir&quot; faction, based in the Sudanese towns of Nasir, Akobo and Waat. The government has seized towns long held by Garang's forces, most recently Kapoeta, a crossroads of 45,000 in the heart of the rebel leader's territory that served as the headquarters for the relief arm of the SPLA, the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to complicating relief efforts, the fall of Kapoeta sent thousands of refugees, including rebel fighters, over the border into Kenya and put further pressure on Garang's headquarters, a town about 90 miles (144 kilometers) to the west. Government forces cut a supply line, leaving Torit open to attack on two fronts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An SPLA spokesman characterizes the rebel's losses of towns as &quot;strategic withdrawals.&quot; But there are indications the setback is more serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-controlled Sudan News Agency reported that when the army took Kapoeta it captured 29 rebel fighters, including two lieutenants, chased three battalions into Kenya, where they were disarmed as refugees, and seized large amounts of weapons, food and medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere in the country, government officials report that hundreds of SPLA fighters, deprived of supplies, are surrendering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's offensive represents the largest government advance into the south since 1983, when the SPLA began the latest in a series of north-south struggles that have divided Sudan since 1955. A 1972 accord granted the south limited autonomy and gave the country a decade of respite from civil war. But fighting began again after the government cut the south into three parts and seized areas containing oil, uranium and fertile land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negotiations in late May and early June marked the first time the government and the SPLA have met for peace talks in over two and a half years.  The Nigeria talks were attended both by Garang's &quot;Torit&quot; SPLA and by the Nasir group, which split from the main rebel body over what it described as human rights violations, mismanagement and unrealistic objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government came to the peace talks with an offer of autonomy for the south within a federal system and exemption from Sharia for non-Moslem areas. The Torit SPLA came asking for a secular state and an end to Islamic law throughout Sudan, and -- if that was not possible -- either confederation or self-determination. The Nasir faction came demanding self-determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the midst of talks, the two rebel groups announced they were unifying, at least at the bargaining table, to press for self-determination.  When the government refused to discuss an independence referendum, the united SPLA agreed to drop the demand and discuss a Nigerian proposal for power-sharing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides agreed to meet again in Abuja at a later date.  n --Karen Lange</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian trade unionist who defeated one of Africa's longest- serving rulers in historic free elections last year ran under the slogan: &quot;The time has come!&quot; Now that slogan must become the banner of an African/American partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last October, when it became apparent that Frederick Chiluba and his Movement for Multiparty Democracy was winning the countryuba and his Movement for Multiparty Democracy was winning the country's first free vote in 17 years, former President Jimmy Carter pledged to lend his support in helping the new government face the twin challenges of democratization and economic recovery.  arter Center in Atlanta, examining growth and business opportunities in the southern African nation. President Chiluba has shown strong support for the process by sending five Cabinet ministers to the meeting, led by the minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry, Ronald Penza. Also taking part are economic advisors and representatives of Zambia's private sector enterprises.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter is chairing the two days of discussions with international financial institutions, aid agencies, academic experts, private companies and banks. Though a less visible undertaking than the Center's monitoring of last fall's elections, our involvement in the Atlanta event has been equally demanding and will, we hope, produce positive benefits for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What have we hoped to achieve by this meeting? First, we want to draw attention to the comprehensive socioeconomic changes that are occurring in many African countries alongside the more visible political changes. News reports are filled with accounts of the challenges of democratization and the transition to market economies in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  Similar changes in Africa are not getting the same attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also hope to combat cynicism within the American business community about Africa as a fertile terrain for private investment. Stories of the frustrated hopes of firms that have taken the gamble of investing in Africa could fill many volumes. Why, companies ask, should they believe that the experience of Zambia under Chiluba is likely to be any different?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first reply to this question can be seen in the dispatch of the powerful government and private sector delegation to Atlanta to demonstrate the Zambian government's seriousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few governments have been as faithful to commitments for quick and painful reversals of economic policies as has Chiluba's administration. Its privatization program, along with sharp reductions of consumer subsidies, the pruning of overstaffed agencies, deliberate probes of mismanagement and corruption, and the steady elimination of bureaucratic constraints to private investments are among the actions that have been taken with impressive urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Atlanta, we wanted to create a forum in which representatives from the Zambian public and private sectors could get frank and expert reactions to their new policies and hear sober reflections on the further challenges that lie ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the most urgent of those tasks is managing the risks associated with the unrestrained capitalist strategy the new government has adopted.  Clearing the way for private enterprise investments could also leave Zambia prey to exploitative practices. New economic activities could entail unacceptable social and environmental costs. These must be clearly identified.  Finally, there is a risk that Zambian goals will be overwhelmed by the outward expansion of South Africa's much larger economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also hope to help put Africa's economic recovery on the national agenda here in the United States, using the special moral authority of former President Carter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent poll in Poland, 39% of individuals questioned stated that they would prefer autocratic approaches to tackling the country's increasing economic difficulties. If Poland fails to experience resumed economic growth, the number of persons willing to abandon the new multiparty democracy will undoubtedly rise. Zambia and the other African countries which have opted for democracy and economic pluralism are hearing the ticking of the same clock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zambia cannot confront any of these challenges successfully without changes in the global economy. Alongside the political and economic changes taking place in Africa, there must be a fresh examination of policies of the industrialized world that constrain development in poorer countries.  These include high tariffs on imports from developing nations and heavy subsidies for agricultural and other products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As citizens of richer nations, we also must assess the responsibilities of our own countries--and of the multilateral financial agencies such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund--in helping clear away the massive debts that new democracies such as Zambia have inherited from former authoritarian regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that Zambians are doing everything that can be asked of them to dismantle monopolistic political and economic systems, the spotlight must be shifted to us.  n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --Manila by David Korten</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the hundreds of forums, conferences and discussion groups around the world that preceded the Earth Summit, environmental activists have raised questions that go further than the formal debates in governmental circles. Much of the nonofficial debate has been carried in the pages of Network '92, the newsletter of the Geneva-based Center for a Common</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Future and the IFC, a group coordinating nongovernmental activities in Rio. A</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recent issue of Network published the following &quot;guest editorial&quot; by the president of the People-Centered Development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forum in the Philippines, summarizing three major issues that have become promi-nent in discussions about radical new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">environmental and economic strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governments of the world and thousands of citizens' organizations have assembled in Brazil for the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). There efforts will be made to formalize agreements intended to resolve major global environmental problems. Countless environmental issues have been identified, yet three fundamental questions, the answers to which are essential to any successful conference outcome, have been consistently sidestepped in official forums.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question 1:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is sustained economic growth possible within a finite ecosystem?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prevailing wisdom says that economic growth will provide us the additional wealth needed to invest in cleaning up the environment. This answer argues in favor of business as usual, with the added caveat that greater skill, wisdom and commitment should be applied in the quest for sustainable economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This argument does not take into consideration data which indicates that environmental destruction is a direct consequence of a world economy which has outgrown the capability of the Earth's ecology to sustain it. Economic growth and progress, as conventionally understood and measured, depend on increasing the flow of physical materials -- such as petroleum, minerals, biomass, and water -- through our economic system. We depend on nature to supply these materials and absorb the resulting wastes. But we have now reached a point at which further advances in human well-being must be achieved without further increasing the economic system's physical throughput. To survive and thrive, greater priority must be given to basic needs, wasteful consumption must be eliminated and physical resources must be used more efficiently. This means that more aggregated growth will only exacerbate the problem and hasten ecosystemic collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we do not bring our economic activity into balance with the limits of the ecosystem in an orderly way, nature will do it for us in a far more brutal way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who challenge the conventional wisdom are dismissed as insensitive to the political realities and the needs of the poor. The real issue, however, is the reluctance of the wealthy to accept the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obvious implication that if further aggregate growth will not resolve the global crisis, then the only option that will assure the survival of human civilization is a massive reallocation of existing global wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, self-deception is not an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question 2:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the removal of barriers to the free international flow of trade and capital consistent with the essential need for community and environmental stewardship?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conventional wisdom says that economic growth, and thereby the well-being of people, is best served by the elimination of barriers to the free flow of trade and capital across national borders. We face two problems here, the first being the growing body of evidence indicating that increases in economic output do not necessarily result in improved human well-being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second is less evident but even more basic. The competitive market is a powerful force for human advancement and one of the most important institutional inventions of human society. However, as with any powerful force, including the state, it may turn destructive if unrestrained. In the East, we have seen the bonds of community and values of environmental stewardship -- both essential to a just and peaceful human society living in sustainable harmony with its natural environment -- sacrificed to the unrestrained power of the state. In the West, they are being sacrificed to the unrestrained forces of the market. Herein lies a simple lesson. The forces of both state and market must be balanced one against the other and held accountable to the people's interests through the mechanisms of civil society. Both balance and accountability are lost when goods and capital move freely across national borders and people thereby lose their ability to regulate their own national economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question 3:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is official international assistance part of the solution or part of the problem?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to conventional wisdom, increases in international assistance are essential to environmental protection and the eradication of poverty in the South. While international assistance has continually increased over the past four decades, poverty and environmental destruction have consistently worsened. In the meantime, assisted economies have become strangled with debt -- the majority of it from official sources -- further deepening poverty and pressing assisted countries to mine environmental resources for foreign exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if we discount the growing number of donor assisted projects actively exacerbating these unfavorable trends, we must conclude that official international assistance has failed, if its purpose has been to create equitable and sustainable development for assisted countries. There is therefore every reason to expect that more aid will only make the problem worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official agencies responsible for the Earth Summit are not asking these basic questions. On the contrary, they repeatedly reaffirm the conventional wisdom with such ideological commitment that those who harbor doubts prefer to hold them in silence lest they be branded heretics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unlikely that the delegates to UNCED will find the right answers to our global crisis without first asking the right questions. Concerned citizens have no alternative. We must commit ourselves to assuring that these and other fundamental questions -- no matter how heretical they may seem -- are asked and thoroughly examined within the context of the UNCED process and other official forums.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1960 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The call for sustainable development is not simply a call for environmental protection. Instead, sustainable development implies a new concept of economic growth -- one that provides fairness and opportunity for all the world's people, not just the privileged few, without further destroying the world's finite natural resources and carrying capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sustainable development is a process in which economic, fiscal, trade, energy, agricultural, industrial and all other policies are so designed as to bring about development that is economically, socially and ecologically sustainable. This means that current consumption cannot be financed for long by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">incurring economic debts that others must repay. This also means that sufficient investment must be made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the education and health of today's population so as not to create a social debt for future generations. Natural resources must be used in ways that do not create ecological debts by overexploiting the carrying and productive capacity of the earth. All postponed debts mortgage sustainability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sustainable development is a comprehensive concept -- embracing all facets of human life. Implementation of models of sustainable development would require far-reaching changes in both national and global policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sustainability demands a careful balance between the compulsions of today and the needs of tomorrow, between private initiative and public action, between individual greed and social compassion. Sustainable models will also require a major restructuring of existing budget priorities -- from military spending and inefficient public enterprises towards more human investment and environmentally safe technologies -- as well as mobilization of additional resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the global level, sustainable models of development require no less than a new global ethic, a clear understanding that the world cannot be made safe for anyone without the willing cooperation of everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of an unequal world of the poor and the rich, the concept of one world and one planet simply cannot emerge without some basic reforms. Nor can shared responsibility be created for the health of the global commons without some measure of shared global prosperity. Global sustain-ability without global justice will always remain an elusive goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is within such a broad perspective that the following six basic policy messages are offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Environmental concerns are not a science fiction but a real growing danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts on environmental degradation are simply shocking. They are not the exaggerations of excited minds but a worldwide phenomena:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Over the past 40 years, the world's population has more than doubled, to reach a size of 5.3 billion people. It is likely to double again over the next 40 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* About 10% of the planet's potentially fertile land has already been turned into desert or waste through human interference or human indifference, while a further 25% is endangered. Over 20 million hectares of tropical forests are being cut down each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Most of the poor people live in the most ecologically vulnerable areas: 80% in Latin America, 60% in Asia and 50% in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* About 1.3 billion people have access to only polluted water; 2.3 billion lack access to sanitation facilities; and 1.5 billion lack sufficient fuelwood for cooking and heating purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The major industrialized nations produced some 9 billion tons of solid waste in 1990 including 300 million tons of hazardous waste; 70% of it is disposed of in landfills from where it can affect</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">human health and safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* American and European researchers have recently discovered that the depletion of the protective ozone layer is no longer just a problem in far-off Antarctica: it is about to occur over densely-populated zones in the Northern Hemisphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Environmental losses are a reality. They affect the lives of billions of people -- in developed and developing countries alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  A thoughtful response to these environmental concerns is neither a stoppage of economic growth nor a continuation of previous patterns of growth but designing of new models of sustainable development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no choice between economic growth and environmental protection.  Growth is not an option.  It is an imperative.  The issue is not how much economic growth but what kind of growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuation of the present state of poverty will be one of the greatest threats to the sustainability of the physical planet, not just to the sustainability of human life.  Poor people and poor countries depend on the soil for food, the rivers for water, and the forests for fuel.  Even though they need these resources desperately, the poor have little choice -- without assets or income -- but to overuse and to destroy their natural environment, simply to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued growth in the industrial nations is necessary to generate both the new environmentally safe technologies and the extra margin of resources for transfer to poor nations.  The current growth models of the industrial nations must change drastically.  The current emphasis on quantitative growth should certainly be replaced by more concern with qualitative growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The new models of sustainable development must focus on people as their primary concern, incorporate new environmentally safe technologies into all investment planning and seek ways to reflect the scarcity value of environmental resources into future decision-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new models of sustainable development must be based on at least four guiding principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, these development models must place people at the very center of their concern.  Environmental protection is vital.  But is not an end in itself.  Like economic growth, it is merely a means.  The primary objective of our efforts must be to protect human life and human options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the new models of development must be based on the adoption of environmentally sound technologies. This is particularly important in the energy sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, we must provide a powerful incentive for reflecting the correct value of environment in all decision-making processes. Markets and private investors often regard environment as a free resource: the scarcity value of this resource is seldom reflected in investment decisions. The only effective way to underscore the value of environment is to put a price on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, sustainable development models must be participatory and community based. They must use local wisdom, experience and traditions for sustainable management of water, land and soils, forests, range and pasture lands, fisheries and wildlife.  Unless local communities believe in and contribute to sustainability, national models of sustainable development will simply languish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The concept of sustainability raises profound questions about the character and distribution of future global growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A question is often raised whether the present material wealth models of the rich nations can be replicated all over the world and whether the natural carrying capacity of the planet can bear such a burden.  The answer is a resounding no.  The North at present constitutes roughly one-fifth of the world's population, while it consumes 70% of the world's energy, 75% of its metals, 85% of its wood and 60% of its food. This clearly shows the impossibility of replicating and continuing present models of material consumption all over the world.  The character of growth models must change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more, the existing distribution of global consumption and global wealth must undergo a fundamental change.  The North is not entitled forever to 85% of the global income.  The limited carrying capacity of our physical planet raises profound questions about the material life styles of the rich, about simpler and less energy--intensive life styles all over the world, and about a major redistribution of future development opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  There are critical differences between the environmental priorities of the developing and the developed nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Developed countries are preoccupied with global warming, depletion of ozone layers and disposal of chemical wastes.  Developing countries are concerned with more basic issues of human survival: water and land. Thus, at the lower end of the income scale, poverty is as great an enemy of the environment as misspent affluence by rich societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Sustainable development models must avoid the false distinction between national and global environmental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such distinctions are often made. In fact, they are enshrined in the current oper-ations of the Global Environment Facility (a World Bank run environment &quot;superfund&quot;) which is meant to deal only with the issues of global warming, destruction of biological diversity, pollution of international waters and depletion of the ozone layer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every global environmental problem results from a series of national actions.  One cannot tackle global pollution without examining its national origins and dealing with its root causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who wish to tackle global pollution must tackle global poverty as well.  The environment cannot be made safe at the global level if it is continuously threatened at the national level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Earth Summit offers a unique opportunity to strike a new global compact between rich and poor nations. If the human race finally discovers that its survival is linked together, then the Summit would have marked the beginnings of a new understanding, a new era of cooperation, a new journey of hope.  n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Tami Hultman * Africa News Service The first thing Wangari Maathai did when she regained consciousness in a Nairobi hospital after being clubbed by Kenyan police during a demonstration was to call a press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling the March 1 protest, where she joined the mothers of political prisoners in a march calling for their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">release, the Kenyan biologist and environmental crusader says she felt a responsibility to the jailed men, who had spoken up for democracy at great personal cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not surprising that her participation made her a target of the authorities -- again. The founder of Kenya's 15-year-old Greenbelt Movement, she has become perhaps the most articulate symbol of the campaign for democratic reforms. She is able to mobilize action not only from international environmental groups, but also from human rights and political organizations around the world. Numerous government attempts to intimidate and silence her have backfired, making her more vocal and visible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she appeared at a court hearing after the mothers' protest, limping from injuries suffered when she was taken into custody, the global network went into action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a press release through its international embassies saying that most of the complaints it has received about suppression of the democracy movement &quot;are centered around the arrest of Prof. Wangari Maathai.&quot; The statement denied that Maathai had been beaten by police, saying she was &quot;suffering silently from rheumatism&quot; -- an explanation that was greeted with hoots of laughter from environmentalists and journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the government is trying once more to still her voice. Maathai won a legal appeal to get a passport to attend the Earth Summit in Rio, but she is under court order to return by the end of the month to Nairobi, where she faces charges of &quot;rumormongering&quot; against the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wangari Maathai is a perfect clincher for those who argue that women are Africa's future -- the key to democratization, sustainable development and environmental salvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visiting New York en route to Brazil, she turns heads on the street.  Dressed in a sweater and borrowed shawl against the unseasonable chill, with black Reeboks peeking from a tie-dyed cloth wrap skirt that has seen years of wear, she looks a bit like a rural refugee displaced to the streets of Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is also gorgeous, a quality irrelevant to her work but impossible to ignore. Her eyes sparkle, her ready laugh reveals straight white teeth, her capable hands gesture with animation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founding a group that has grown to over 50,000 women, who have planted millions of trees and saved thousands</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of acres of topsoil, seems mere prologue for a person of such energy and optimism. She is already in the record books as the first Kenyan women to earn a doctorate, the first to be appointed a professor and the first to head a university department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the age of 52, she has earned ten international awards, is listed in three international &quot;Who's Who&quot; volumes, including Who's Who of World Intellectuals, has headed the National Council of Kenyan Woman and been appointed to several international scientific committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That she remains so vulnerable to attack is worrying to her friends, who have urged her to take personal security precautions. Asked if she isn't afraid to go home, she is uncharacteristically slow in answering. &quot;Well, let me say this,&quot; she says finally. &quot;I know that I am in danger, and I know that the government has tried to put me aside. At the moment, because of the political turmoil in my country, one cannot rule out the possibility of the worst, so I do feel that I need to take care of myself. I need to stay away from dangerous ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that doesn't mean that I will not go back home. I will go home because that is where I am needed most.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mother of two teenagers and a son about to finish college, Maathai is a single parent, her marriage a casualty of her achievements and her notoriety. Her former husband was a member of parliament and a businessman, who finally tired of being regarded as unmanly by his colleagues for being unable to control his wife. Their divorce was a public affair, tried in newspapers -- her first but not last experience of a negative press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years ago, Maathai scuttled President Daniel arap Moi's plans to build a 60-story office tower flanked by a large statue of himself in a Nairobi park, when she persuaded foreign funders that the project was environmentally unsound. Her victory was popular among downtown workers, who use the park as a lunch spot and refuge from urban sprawl. But her action earned her the bitter enmity of the ruling party, whose newspaper and a television station were to be headquartered in what was to have been Africa's tallest building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, Maathai has been under constant government assault.  President Moi ruled that foreign assistance to women's development projects must be channeled through the state women's organization, effectively cutting off aid to the Greenbelt Movement, which also was evicted from its offices. She has been followed by menacing figures and threatened repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Maathai recognizes that some of her problems have come from being a woman who dared stand up to men, she remains convinced that men and women must form a partnership for change. &quot;I think that when we talk about the position of women in Africa and see how miserable it is,&quot; she says, &quot;quite often we forget that these miserable women are married to miserable men. They are oppressed together, and it is only a small group of elite middle-class Africans who can say that they have made it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I'd really like to see,&quot; she says, &quot;is not just an improvement in the condition of women but the economic and political improvement of the African economy, so that all people can move forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maathai's critics appear most enraged by her belief that rural women and men can be empowered by personal action and involvement. As a founding member of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy in Kenya, Maathai is a lightning rod for the government's mounting anger at its opponents, a fact that appears not to deter her. &quot;I don't want to pay a price with my life,&quot; she says, but she adds that fighting for democracy often entails a cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview for the &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour,&quot; Charlayne Hunter-Gault asked Maathai if the environmental movement has become a political movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The environmental movement,&quot; she replied, &quot;has become part and parcel of the pro-democracy movement.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator Albert Gore, a Tennessee Democrat, has become the most verbal environmentalist in the U.S.government. His book, Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit (Houghton Mifflin, 1992), is a passionate plea for worldwide mobilization against what Gore sees as an imminent global disaster.  As a member of the official U.S. delegation to the Earth Summit, Gore promised to raise, in the formal sessions, many of the issues that non-governmental organizations are discussing in adjacent meetings. Recently, AfricaNews spoke with the senator about Africa's place in the environmental equation. Here are excerpts from that conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa News: How do you see Africa's political and economic changes in a global context?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore: In the 1990s, the world as a whole seems to have made three important decisions: number one, democracy is going to be the preferred form of political organization on this planet; number two, modified free markets are going to be the preferred form of economic organization world-wide, and number three, people everywhere seem to feel themselves as part of a global civilization. Problems are now seen in a global context and tragedies, like the ecological catastrophies unfolding in many parts of Africa, can no longer be relegated to the back pages of our mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Does that mean we should be paying more attention to events in Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore: That ought to happen with those who are starving in Somalia or Ethiopia. It ought to happen to the victims of violence in areas of Africa that are undergoing such political turmoil. I believe it is only a matter of time before we see the effort to save the global environment as the central organizing principal (of our policies). If and as that occurs, then the problems besetting much of Africa will be higher on the list of priorities for wealthy nations like the U.S., and those of Western Europe and Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: What do you see as the most pressing environmental issues in Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore: Two items at the top of the agenda are climate change and biodiversity. The fires in the forests of Central Africa are almost as extensive as those in the Amazon in South America. The deforestation in parts of Africa is as extensive as anywhere in the world. Ethiopia had 40% tree cover at the end of World War II. Now it only has one percent tree cover. Problems like these should be addressed at the Earth Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stabilizing of population must be a top priority. Egypt has 52 million people today. Thirty years from now, according to the best projections, it will have 100 million people. Nigeria has 100 million people; it will have 300 million. Kenya has 27 million people today; within 25 years it will have 50 million people. Overall, the population of Africa is increasing so rapidly that the ability of the social and political order to accommodate these increases is strained to the breaking point. And good work by many men and women who are trying to rebuild their communities and societies is threatened by this instability that comes from rapid explosion in population and the pressure that exerts on the surrounding countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: What sort of role is foreign aid playing -- and should it play -- in protecting the continent's environment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore: Africa cannot hope to make it without help from the outside world. However, the amount of money that Africa pays in interest to the rest of the world is more than the total amount of foreign aid from every nation in the world which comes in to Africa. And in fact that gap (between money flowing out of Africa and resources coming in) is growing wider every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert McNamara said years ago that it is a little like a blood transfusion from the sick to the healthy. So ideas like debt-for-nature swaps (which reduce a nation's debt to foreign creditors in exchange for commitments to protect specific wilderness areas) must be pursued vigorously. At the Earth Summit, we have an opportunity to see the entire world reach agreement on the viability of an idea like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Does public opinion support the strategies you advocate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore: Well, we are not there yet, but we are nearing a threshold beyond which there will be a critical mass of public opinion in favor of saving the global environment. And we cannot save the global environment unless we save Africa and Latin America and Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe and other parts of the earth that are now under siege, where the environment is being devastated. When that is generally recognized and confronted, then political support for sensible measures taken in concert with Europe and Japan and the all rich nations of the Middle East, will become not only feasible but imperative.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos, Nigeria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With discontent rising over plummeting living standards and severe fuel shortages, everyone from market women to foreign ambassadors sensed an explosion was coming here. Yet when it did, most Nigerians were shocked by its scope and ferocity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A combination of anti-poverty riots in southern Nigeria and bloody clashes between Christians and Muslims in the north have rocked the military government, sparking a crisis unprecedented since an abortive military coup in April 1990. The regime of President Ibrahim Babangida has responded by shifting into a crisis management mode.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After seven years in power, Babangida says he stands by plans to hand power to civilians a year and a half from now. But a question mark hangs over the leader's future. &quot;We used to ask the question: 'Will Babangida really leave office at the appointed time?,'&quot; said one human rights activist and government critic after the latest trouble. &quot;Now we wonder if the government will last that long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nationwide address to the nation on May 26, the president warned he would not be &quot;bullied, through illegal action, to abandon the path of planned economic and political progress,&quot; and he promised &quot;to crack down on all persons, associations and groups that seek to either derail the transition program or destabilize the nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although expectations for the speech ran high, the only specific action Babangida announced was a two-year-old plan to create a national guard, trained for anti-riot duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mid-May unrest in Lagos, a giant metropolis and Nigeria's commercial center, began when unemployed youths sidetracked a previously peaceful protest organized by the banned National Association of Nigerian Students. The young people smashed cars, looted shops and extorted money from passersby not wearing the green leaves that were a sign of solidarity with the anti-government demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sporadic riots continued for several days, especially in the big Idumota market on the central island of Lagos, where local thugs known as &quot;area boys'&quot; sought to extort protection money from traders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unrest was worsened by rising disgust over fuel shortages that have nagged Africa's biggest oil producer for months, sometimes becoming so severe that several southern cities were paralyzed by huge lines of vehicles snaking through the streets waiting hours to make limited gasoline purchases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's economic austerity measures, enacted in large part to satisfy foreign creditors, also have been a major source of dissatisfaction. A turning point in public opinion came with a devaluation in March of the national currency, from 10.5 to 18.6 naira to the U.S. dollar, which sent prices for basic necessities skyrocketing by 50% and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Babangida came to power in a 1985 coup d'etat, critics and supporters agree he has maintained the political initiative with a tightly controlled program to hand power back to civilians. A quiver full of military decrees, which the courts cannot challenge, has allowed him to shoot down problems as they arose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 19, for example, the government banned all ethnic, religious and regional associations that have been organizing support for specific candidates in the national assembly and presidential elections later this year. Offenders were threatened with jail terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to weaken the ethnic, religious and regional divisiveness that has plagued Nigerian politics since independence from Britain in 1960, the military created the country's two sole legal political parties, the National Republican Convention and the Social Democratic Party, and wrote their party platforms. The regime has shifted the date for a return to civilian rule from its original date of October 1990 to January 1993. Politicians have been banned, then unbanned. Human rights activists have been detained and then set free, their passports confiscated and then returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Babangida, the complexities of ruling a nation of nearly 90 million people and 250 ethnic groups are taking their toll. The government has drawn consistent fire from Muslim fundamentalists in the north for refusing to turn Nigeria into an Islamic state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the religious clashes that claimed several hundred lives last month pose problems for the military leaders, the most vociferous critics of Babangida's transition program come from the small, intelligencia centered in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest confrontation came with the arrest on May 19 of three leading members of the Campaign for Democracy -- Beko Ransome-Kuti, Femi Falanae and Baba Omojola -- and on May 29 of a fourth, Chief Gani Fawehinmi.  &quot;If the government thinks it can divert attention from the ongoing social protests enveloping the country by arresting patriots it is simply engaging in self-deceit,&quot; the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights said in a statement after the crackdown. &quot;We therefore call on the Nigerian people to rise up with us to terminate the Babangida regime without further delay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government faces trouble on the external front as well. An agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a new one-year standby credit agreement has stumbled over the government's massive budget deficit. The shortfall officially totaled $ 1.7 billion last year, but some Western donors believe it was closer to $ 2.5 billion. Last year's standby agreement was aborted after Nigeria missed meeting targets on curbing state spending and managing the exchange rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a new IMF stamp of approval, Nigeria has little hope of rescheduling its official debt to foreign creditors and reducing its debt service obligations this year, which now total $ 5 billion -- about half of total export earnings. IMF disapproval would also mean that negotiations on a three-year Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), for which Nigeria is now eligible, would have to await the incoming civilian administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's total foreign debt of $ 30 billion is the biggest in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with public outrage over fuel shortages so high, Babangida has ruled out the one possible action that could immediately erase the budget deficit: lifting the government subsidy on the price of fuel, which is among the lowest in the world.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The slogan &quot;Think globally, act locally,&quot; coined by environmental groups in the wealthy, industrialized countries of the northern hemisphere, is becoming a way of life for more and more people in the poor nations of the south. From mountain farmers protecting a nature reserve in Cameroon to Kenyan scientists developing environment-friendly pest controls, Africans are part of the trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one person better personifies the environmental movement in developing countries than biologist Wangari Maathai of Kenya, who says that awareness of the need for urgent collective action is spreading. &quot;People have personalized the message,&quot; she says, &quot;because they have seen the need to take care of their immediate environment, and by participating they have been able to reap some of the benefits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the growing numbers of people trying to eke out a living on fragile tropical soils is putting unprecedented pressure on local resources. Trees are cut for fuel. Water is polluted by agricultural chemicals. Wildlife is killed by farmers shielding their crops.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That reality has spawned a view evident in environmental discussions and press reports in the north, that people in poorer countries have less vested interest in protecting the environment than those in more developed nations. Newsweek magazine quotes a Western diplomat who characterized the view of many poor countries this way: &quot;If there's a decision to be made between development and environment, they'll go for development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting the case for financial assistance to help poorer countries develop in ecologically sound ways, Newsweek says the world will reap the benefit. People in developing countries, the magazine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says, &quot;might someday look at a tree the way people do in Marin County as the handiwork of God, rather than a big piece of firewood stuck in the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tell that to Wangari Maathai! The Greenbelt Movement she founded 15 years ago has mobilized 50,000 women who already have planted millions of trees and are still going strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Maathai sees it, the debate over development versus the environment is a false one. The more pressing issue is one of power: who wields it and who benefits? As long as poor-country dictators are installed, supported or tolerated by powerful international interests, she argues, the global environment is at risk. Only democratic structures that empower ordinary people -- especially women -- can save the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we plant trees in Kenya,&quot; Maathai says, &quot;we know that we will eventually have our hands on politics, on economics, on culture, on all aspects that either destroy or create a sustainable environment. And in countries like ours, where there is a lot of poverty, you eventually have to address that issue and ask: 'Why is there so much poverty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maathai and other developing-country environmentalists acknowledge that rural peasants around &amp;the world will chop trees or kill animals to survive the next day. On the other hand, the activists argue, poor people--when given the slightest margin to act in their own behalf--become the world's most vociferous conservationists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To even the most zealous North American activist, issues like global warming are several removes from daily survival. Living closer to the edge, people in developing countries can reap immediate, tangible benefits from environmental protection and reclamation. A road not built through a coastal mangrove swamp spares the habitat upon which the day's fishing depends. A rain forest exempted from logging will provide culls for vital cooking fuel. A river saved from pollutants can be the difference between life and death for entire communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spreading realization that rich and poor are united in their long-term dependence on a shared global heritage is the impetus behind the &quot;Earth Summit&quot; in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The hundreds of world leaders and thousands of concerned citizens who have converged on the summit have begun, at least superficially, to speak a common language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sustainable development,&quot; the concept that economic growth must be pursued in a way that preserves the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, is being championed in the halls of the World Bank, the mines of Zambia, the deserts of north Africa and the streets of Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how to achieve the goal remains a bitterly divisive question. One of the problems, says American economist Winifred Armstrong, is that governments remain committed to an obsolete model of economic growth. &quot;As I see it,&quot; she says, &quot;neither the North nor the South is sustainable under the present economic framework. Trying harder, using current economic premises, is clearly not working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armstrong, who derives her perspective from applied experience, including years of work for a major U.S. mining company with extensive international interests, recently returned from seven months of travel across Africa. She says both individuals and governments need to move beyond the restrictive framework of both capitalist and socialist economic models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Armstrong, Wangari Maathai sees a multiplicity of factors constraining healthy economic growth, including the massive debts encouraged by international lenders and incurred by corrupt or inefficient authoritarian governments. Africa has the largest proportional debt burden by far, and repayment obligations consume the bulk of many countries' resources. The need to earn foreign currency to repay those debts has intensified the drive to abandon subsistence agriculture and clear forests in order to grow cash crops for export. &quot;It is ordinary men, women and children who pay,&quot; Maathai says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most people I talked to in Africa,&quot; says Winifred Armstrong, &quot;believe they can live primarily on what their countries produce. But under the prevailing export model of growth, most African countries can't even survive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maathai believes that foreign aid, whether in the form of loans or grants, has played a direct role in stifling African development. &quot;We have seen a lot of aid flowing into Africa,&quot; she told Charlayne Hunter-Gault of the &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour.&quot; &quot;But a lot of that aid was in the form of arms that were used to sustain dictators that we are now desperately trying to get rid of. And this was done with the full knowledge and support of the super powers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African activists are insisting that shared power, not only within individual countries but also among the world's nations, is an essential ingredient of global progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Certain actions by the industrialized countries indicate that developing countries will have problems being taken seriously in Rio,&quot; says Tendai Msengezi of the Southern African Research and Documentation Center (SARDC) based in Harare, Zimbabwe. &quot;Developing countries fear that the industrialized countries are determined to dictate to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists and environmentalists from poor countries worry that -- despite the hoopla surrounding the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro -- developed nations will push ineffective half measures: insisting that poor countries remove tariffs on imports, while retaining their own barriers against competition from the developing world; insisting on debt repayment, while paying bottom dollar for the commodities that poor countries produce; demanding protection of wildlife in tourist-frequented game parks, but encouraging roads through rain forests housing endangered species; financing reforestation on the one hand and backing mining projects that denude vast tracks on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Korinna Horta of the Washington, DC-based Environmental Defense Fund, maintains that &quot;on the ground, it's business as usual.&quot; She cites a $ 10 milliongrant by the Global Environment Facility -- a sort of environmental superfund launched in 1990 and administered by the World Bank -- to a project in Congo, whose stated aim is to &quot;bring forestry exploitation back to life.&quot; The United Nations Development Program and the World Rain Forest Movement are among the groups who have questioned whether renewed logging will benefit the area the grant is intended to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration's announcement that the United States will oppose the biodiversity treaty negotiated last month by 98 nations in Nairobi has further fueled doubts that northern governments are willing to do more than talk tough about the environment. The treaty, which was to have been a major achievement of the Rio meeting, along with an agreement on global warming, aims to protect threatened plants, animals and natural resources around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a SARDC report last month, Tendai Msengezi wrote that at the final preparatory meeting in New York prior to the Summit, northern governments balked at any conference follow-up &quot;that is not dominated by the G7 countries (the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Britain led an opposition group from the industrialized countries,&quot; Msengezi wrote, &quot;which refused a proposal made by 40 developing countries for a sustainable development commission to monitor the performances of both the North and the South in implementing decisions that would have been arrived at in Brazil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the image of wealthy nations pressing for environmental safeguards and poor nations resisting strict standards, in the interests of their own development, may be turned topsy-turvy in the months after Rio. If the representatives of grassroots groups, green movements and non-governmental organizations forge a global network, as many hope, their voices may become the chorus that drowns out the established tune equating economic health with conventional growth models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Am I optimistic that we will do it? Not necessarily,&quot; says Winifred Armstrong. &quot;Am I optimistic that we can do it? Yes.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's president and its minister of commerce are appealing to Europe and the United States for investment, as the country's young democratically elected government faces a meager harvest, labor unrest and clashes between members of the ousted and the current ruling parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we falter for not having the right vision, democracy will perish,&quot; Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry Ronald Penza told those attending an investment conference June 11 and 12 at the Carter Center in Atlanta (see AfricaNews, June 8, 1992, page 5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penza and other cabinet ministers said Zambia -- committed to major reforms since trade unionist Frederick Chiluba was elected president last October -- plans to reduce state ownership in the dominant copper mining industry, as well as in tourism and farming, paring the public sector to 20% of the economy from its present 80%. The country's labor leaders are urging a go-slow approach to privatization, which often involves a loss of jobs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba, who was general secretary of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions when he defeated Kenneth Kaunda in Zambia's first multiparty elections since 1972, told a recent news conference in Geneva that assuming the reins of government had been sobering. &quot;The thrill of victory,&quot; he said, &quot;was soon replaced by an ominous realization that the country was not only run down and ravaged by mismanagement, but indeed also that the treasury was bare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba also is facing other harsh realities:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The southern African drought has reduced harvests of maize, Zambia's staple crop, to a third of its normal level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There has been conflict between members of Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy and Kaunda's United National Independence Party. The governing party has seized the offices of its predecessor on the grounds that they were built with public money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An economic austerity program that has raised staple food prices nearly 200% has been applauded by international lenders and donors but has received poor reviews from workers. Labor unions are demanding 600% pay increases to cope with cost of living increases. Their members have staged more than 30 strikes, walkouts and slowdowns at banks, schools and municipal offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba said in Geneva that the strikes reflect &quot;some excitement and some abuse, now that we are all free.&quot; In time, he said, &quot;the people will learn that democracy is their own creation and that they don't have to destroy their own baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moves Toward Peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Chad says a peace accord has been reached with one rebel group based in the south of the country. The rebels agreed to end their fighting in return for an amnesty for an estimated 3,000 dissident troops and the release of all soldiers and civilians arrested after February disturbances in the capital, N'Djamena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The February unrest included the murder of a prominent human rights leader, Joseph Behidi, a southerner, allegedly by government troops from the north. Led by Lt. Kette Nodji, southern troops fled N'Djamena after the killing and launched a low-level insurgency from the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Idriss Deby, who pledged democratic rule when he seized power in late 1990, says his plans for elections are being jeopardized by continuing conflict and ethnic rivalries which have spilled over into several reported coup attempts. Larger insurgencies continue in the Lake Chad region north of the capital and in the center of the country, which is almost as large as Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chad's army chief reported that 164 rebels and 19 government soldiers were killed in clashes near Lake Chad in early June. The chief's statement, read on state radio, said the rebels were loyal to former head-of-state Hissein Habre, who was ousted by Deby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One opposition leader in N'Djamena, Gaileth Gattoul, secretary-general of the Revolutionary Democratic Council-Rejection Front, has issued a call for a national conference &quot;to avoid a new civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government of Algeria released about 3,000 detainees from sweltering camps in the Sahara Desert in early June, following demands to close the camps by opposition parties and human rights groups who say the oncoming summer heat is making conditions at the camps intolerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detainees are suspected members of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), a fundamentalist group that appeared on its way to victory in Algeria's first free general elections since independence in 1962. Poised to declare Algeria an Islamic republic last December, the FIS was blocked by President Mohamed Boudiaf's army-backed High State Council, which canceled the general elections and outlawed the FIS and other Islamic fundamentalist political parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 4,000 remain in the Sahara detention camps. But the Algerian news agency reports more will be released and says those suspected of serious offenses will be moved north to escape the heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 9, Boudiaf announced the formation of a &quot;National Rally&quot; made up of citizens, associations and organizations, that will have a &quot;mandate for radical political change.&quot; The FIS will be banned from participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence by suspected Islamic fundamentalists has continued during June, with the murder of at least two policemen, bringing the number of police and army personnel assassinated since the elections were canceled to about 60.  In other incidents, five police officers were wounded in a daytime attack by gunmen in the Algiers area and bombs exploded at two police stations in the eastern city of Constantine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They Shoot Elephants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Park managers in Zimbabwe say drought will force them to shoot 2,000 elephants and 1,500 buffalo in danger of starving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 1,000 elephants will be herded from the Gonarezhou National Park, in southwest Zimbabwe on the Mozambique border. The animals will be moved to game ranches, which will assume ownership of half the herds as compensation for providing food and water. Crocodile, Roan antelope, sable zebra, waterbuck and nyala will also be moved from the national park, where virtually no rain fell this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parts of Gonarezhou are barren, without grass or leaves. Only 80 of some 500 hippopotamuses remain alive. Bodies of dead hippos lie strewn in riverbeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides averting mass starvation of the animals, the forced cull will benefit hungry people who live near the park. Meat from the slain animals will go to villagers reduced by the drought to eating nuts and worms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite recent political changes in South Africa, police and members of the military have been involved in a systematic pattern of torture and assassinations aimed at the African National Congress (ANC) and its allies, according to a report released June 10 by Amnesty International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reforms of the past two years have brought about some sweeping changes, but as far as the security forces are concerned, it's business as usual,&quot; the London-based organization says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amnesty report says that many mass killings in the townships were carried out by the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, an ANC rival, with support from police and security forces. The contention supports claims by ANC leader Nelson Mandela that the government is orchestrating and supporting Inkatha violence in order to further its own agenda of weakening his organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report issued in early June, the International Commission of Jurists agreed. The commission laid much of the blame for the continuing violence on Inkatha and says security forces colluded with them against the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A South African government-appointed judicial commission last month found that individual policemen had assisted attacks against the ANC, but said there was no evidence that the attacks were government orchestrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In statements released June 10, both Inkatha and the government rejected the findings of the Amnesty report. Government officials placed blame for the violence squarely on the Inkatha/ANC rivalry, while Inkatha criticized Amnesty's sources and research methods.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Horn of Africa's worst drought since 1984 and a massive influx of refugees have finally forced Kenya to launch its first appeal for international emergency aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Livestock are dying, food prices have skyrocketed and, according to Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, one million people in the northeastern, eastern, coastal and Rift Valley provinces are facing famine, while the country copes with nearly a million refugees from neighboring Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi has appealed for 175,100 tons of food to feed 680,000 of the worst-affected Kenyans and refugees over the next 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Community (EC) has provided 30,000 tons, including wheat, rice, oil and supplements for malnourished children. The EC aid is part of a $ 350 million assistance package for countries in East and southern Africa affected by drought and famine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi's plea for food aid comes at a crucial time for Kenya. Six months ago, in response to an international aid cutoff and mounting domestic pressure for democratic reforms, Moi reluctantly agreed to legalize opposition parties.  Critics say little has changed in the political landscape and charge that Moi has not accepted the spirit of multiparty politics. Democracy advocates cite periodic arrests of journalists and outspoken activists, bans on opposition rallies and the failure of Moi's government to establish an independent electoral commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sweden, which is among those Western donors who suspended most development aid to Kenya in December, announced June 7 that it would provide $ 35 million for water and road projects, veterinarian training and improvementsin administration of the country's banks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot help remembering the victims of this martyred part of Angola; many of them innocent, killed by the ideological confrontation and war,&quot; the Pope said on his arrival in Luanda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than one million people were killed, injured or displaced in the conflict between Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' ruling Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba, and Jonas Savimbi's Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita), backed by the United States and South Africa. The war ended with a peace settlement 13 months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blaming the Soviet Union, China, East Germany and Cuba for exporting communism to Angola, the pope pledged that the church will play a major role to help move the nation to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola's first multiparty elections are scheduled for September 29-30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pontiff met with dos Santos and Savimbi, who will face off in the September vote, and urged the leaders to &quot;overcome the temptation to prolong the armed conflict, the source of ruin and useless suffering.&quot; Both sides are reported to have stored caches of arms, should the move to multiparty elections fall through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No violence took place during the visit, but three journalists affiliated with Unita were prevented from covering one of the pontiff's trips.  Unita radio charged discrimination, but government radio said that the three were turned back because they were carrying guns in their vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 300,000 people lined roads leading to the site of the final mass of the tour on June 9. The Pope also visited the island nation of Sao Tome and Principe before returning to the Vatican June 10.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On African university campuses from Harare to Lagos, economic hard times have sparked a wave of bitter conflicts between students and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least half of Nigeria's universities are closed; the entire student body of Zimbabwe's most prestigious university was expelled in June; and Kenyan students have been protesting en masse against the government of President Daniel arap Moi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late April, 3,000 students clashed with police in the streets outside of Kenya's parliament while charging the government with instigating ethnic clashes in western Kenya. Students of Kenya Polytechnic waved anti-government placards and called for the resignation of Moi, Vice President and Minister for Finance George Saitoti, House Speaker Jonathan Ng'eno and Commissioner of Police Philip Kilonzo. The day before, students of the University of Nairobi held similar protests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 8, students from the University of Nairobi erected a roadblock on the street to Moi's official residence, threw stones at passing motorists and heavily damaged two university canteens. Reuters news agency reports students said bad meals at the canteens sparked the riots, which were also linked to the reluctance of university authorities to register a new student organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Harare, the expulsion of more than 8,000 students at the University of Zimbabwe followed a month of student protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Student activists had sought increases in loans and grants -- money they said was essential to let them continue to attend school in a period of rapidly rising inflation. But they also raised broader challenges, denouncing alleged government corruption and calling for the resignation of several cabinet ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campus confrontation began May 8 with what has become an almost annual event at the University of Zimbabwe: an invasion of the campus by riot police, who unleashed a massive barrage of tear gas at the first sign of unrest. This year's conflict took an unusual twist, when the university's acting vice-chancellor, Gordon Chavanduka, convinced police to recognize the rights of students to demonstrate peacefully on or off campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights advocates saw the agreement as a potentially significant breakthrough for academic freedom.  However, the truce was smashed by students who rioted in downtown Harare in late May, breaking store windows and overturning cars after marching to the Ministry of Education building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have a right to demonstrate, and we supported them in that right,&quot; Chavanduka said in a telephone interview. &quot;But when it became violent at the end, that we could not tolerate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chavanduka emphasized that expelled students may apply for re-admission. However, re-entering students will be fined to cover the cost of property damage during the demonstrations. And, 15 members of the Student Representative Council are to be barred from receiving the loans and grants that almost all University of Zimbabwe students need to finance their education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nigeria, government action against student activists is a part of a broader political crackdown that has been widely criticized by domestic and international human rights advocates. On June 15, the president of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Olusegun Mayegun, was one of five members of the Campaign for Democracy brought before an Abuja magistrate on charges of treason. Others arraigned included Beko-Ransome Kuti, president of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, and Femi Falana, chairman of the National Association of Democratic Lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treason charges constitute &quot;the most severe crackdown the government has made on the human rights community to date, and they've been pretty brutal,&quot; says Binaifer Nowrojee, head of the Africa Program of the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. Nowrojee says the Abuja arraignment represents a direct violation of rulings from the Lagos High Court, which had directed the government to release Fulana and to bring the five defendants before the court in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 12, two NANS leaders were arrested during a police raid of the University of Lagos campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrests follow the closure in May of about half the nation's two dozen university campuses. Student protests forced some closures, but Osaze Lanre Ehonwa, acting national secretary of the Civil Liberties Organization of Nigeria, charges that most closures were the result of &quot;pre-emptive action&quot; by the government. Ehonwa predicts that these &quot;encroachments on academic freedom&quot; will intensify in the weeks and months ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campus protests began May 9 at the University of Ibadan, when students barricaded the campus, saying they were protesting economic austerity programs that had led to rapid deterioration of campus facilities and educational programs. Conflict spread to the University of Lagos May 13, when students protested an acute shortage of gasoline that led to the doubling of public transit fares. The protests struck a responsive chord among non-students in Lagos' poor neighborhoods, triggering a wave of looting and attacks on motorists. Violence was also reported at Lagos State University, located in the center of one of Lagos' poorest neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These demonstrations followed six months of intensifying campus conflict during which the government &quot;closed a number of universities, proscribed student unions on a number of campuses and expelled and suspended hundreds of students without fair hearings,&quot; according to a report issued in April by the human rights group Africa Watch. University of Lagos student leaders have been complaining since late last year about political spying and physical threats allegedly directed against campus leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa Watch charges that the Nigerian government's &quot;persistent attacks on the universities&quot; created an environment in which &quot;the costs of university education grew, conditions continued to deteriorate on campuses and the demand by students for a meaningful university education went unmet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julius Ihonvbere, former head of the Academic Staff Union at the University of Port Harcourt, says that &quot;accelerating repression of faculty and students,&quot; combined with drastic budget cuts and runaway inflation, made campus conflict inevitable. &quot;The conditions at the universities have deteriorated to such a level that it's difficult to talk about an academic system in Nigeria today. The very best academics are out of the country,&quot; says Ihonvbere, himself now in exile and teaching at the University of Texas at Austin. &quot;The student unions have been suppressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, the Committee for Academic Freedom in Africa has appealed to American universities to provide assistance to Nigerian students displaced by violence and human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many students who were arrested in recent crackdowns are trying to find ways to get out of Nigeria,&quot; says Committee Co-Coordinator Sylvia Federici, an assistant professor of political philosophy and international studies at Hofstra University, near New York City. &quot;It is very important to make academics here see what's happening, find scholarships for students who need to leave Nigeria and provide material support for people who have been imprisoned.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">960 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objectives of ANC socioeconomic policy are to secure economic growth in a society which is politically and socioeconomically stable and democratic. It is our view that this is the most favorable environment for both foreign and domestic investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a component of this environment a consistent, transparent and accessible policy framework for foreign investment will be essential. To achieve this requires a thorough review and revision of existing legislation.  The ANC and its alliance partners are presently working in this area in conjunction with UN agencies to ensure that we embody the best of international practice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is proposed that future policy will be located around certain central features that would move us away from complex incentive packages and policies which seek to exploit cheap labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These central features include: an open approach to the entry of foreign investment in its broad sense (direct foreign investment, portfolio investment and non-equity forms of partnership). This would be accompanied by safeguards for the economy that would be built into the overall policy framework and safeguards for foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the event of nationalization there would be fair compensation in accordance with acceptable principles of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign investors will be assured that, subject to regulations that are administered by the South African Reserve Bank, they will have access to foreign exchange for the purposes of remitting after-tax profits, repaying the interest and capital on approved foreign loans, purchasing inputs and repatriating the proceeds on the sale of assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, that the principle of national treatment for foreign investors would apply. Foreign investors would enjoy the same treatment as domestic investors, and foreign investors would be obliged in all respects to abide by the applicable law of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principle of national treatment for foreign investors would be qualified in ways that are generally specified here, and that would be spelled out clearly in a new policy framework. These are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign investors may be blocked from investing in certain strategic areas such as land, natural resources and certain other sectors, or they may be required to enter into joint venture arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies owned or controlled by nonresidents, or in which nonresidents have a significant shareholding, could have limits placed on their local borrowing facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exceptions from national treatment may also be provided in respect of special advantages and investment incentives granted to previously disadvantaged groups. Those will not be extended to foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where foreign investment can play a specific role in the achievement of policy objectives, specific contractual arrangements may be negotiated with foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the broad policy framework of the ANC, the following issues would be of specific relevance to foreign investment:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the extent to which the enterprise in which the proposed investment is to be made will utilize South African resources, so as to contribute to the economy, by increasing employment opportunities in South Africa; providing for the training of South Africans beyond minimum training obligations required by law; earning or saving foreign exchange; generating development in the less-developed areas of South Africa;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the extent to which the investment will contribute to the transfer of technology and promote the spread of high-level technical skills amongst South African citizens;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the extent to which the enterprise in which the proposed investment is to be made will contribute to the advancement of persons within South Africa who have been socially, economically or educationally disadvantaged by post-discriminatory laws and practices or will facilitate the implementation of policies and programs aimed at redressing social, economic or educational imbalances in South African society;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the extent to which the enterprise in which the proposed investment is to be made will make provision for equal opportunities for women;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the impact which the activities of the enterprise in which the proposed investment is to be made is likely to have on the environment, and the measures proposed to deal with any adverse environmental consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In the event of freer trade and investment relations within southern Africa, or beyond, foreign investors will have the option of investing in several different countries to get access to the same regional market.  Participating countries should avoid unnecessary and costly competition.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prior to the ANC national conference in late May, representatives from the ANC, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), and the South African Communist Party held a day-long workshop to debate one of the thorniest aspects of the economic policy equation -- the approach to foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last several decades, anti-apartheid forces have focussed their energies on forcing multi-national corporations to withdraw from South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the ANC committed to ending sanctions when an interim government is installed, the focus has shifted to potential new investment.  Cosatu has drafted a &quot;Code of Conduct for Multi-National Companies,&quot; calling for adherence to internationally established labor standards, equal-treatment policies, and safe, healthy work conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A policy document adopted by the ANC national conference says the organization &quot;will welcome foreign investment, in accordance with our objective for growth and development.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tough Issues Trouble South African Negotiations</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forum</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1027 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A stalemate in multi-party negotiations over the future of South Africa has underlined the depth of differences dividing the administration of President F.W. de Klerk from its chief negotiating partner, Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC). Opinions vary on whether the disagreements are substantial enough to slow process towards the abolishment of apartheid and the establishment of an interim arrangement, a crucial step towards democratic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negotiations, involving 19 parties from across the political spectrum -- with only extreme right-wing whites and two leftist black groups not participating -- broke down in mid-May. Dismayed by the unexpected turn of events, the ANC on June 16 launched a two-week campaign of work stoppages and mass demonstrations to press its demands for a speedy end to white rule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One fundamental disagreement involves the government's insistence on what the ANC regards as a 'white veto' over the direction and extent of change. The government insists that decisions of a proposed interim legislature be subject to ratification by a vote of three-quarters of the members. The ANC argues that a two-thirds vote is sufficient. The legislature will be charged both with law-making responsibilities and with drafting a new constitution in the run-up to national free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another dispute involves the tenure of a transitional executive council. The government wants the body, made up of representatives from all 19 parties, to remain in existence indefinitely. The ANC wants to limit its tenure to the approximately three months required to elect the interim legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council will have the power to override actions of the de Klerk government and the present parliament, although both will remain in office during the initial transitional phase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While political issues have been the international attention grabber, economic considerations loom large in the strategies of negotiators for every group. &quot;We all, whites and black, think we're entitled to Swedish social security,&quot; John Kane-Berman, director of the South African Institute of Race Relations told the London Financial Times. &quot;But with Polish GDP (Gross Domestic Product), it won't work that way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A chief legacy of white domination, one that no future government can ignore, is a huge racial gap in living standards that will endure long after legal separation is removed. Average income for black South Africans is about one-tenth of that of whites, according to World Bank estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa simply does not have the resources to raise black living standards to white levels,&quot; the Financial Times says in a recently published survey of South Africa. &quot;There is no explosion of economic growth on the horizon to meet the country's huge development needs,&quot; the survey states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also is no agreement on how best to stimulate growth in a manner that doesn't harm as many people as it helps. Derek Keys, the government's finance minister, told the Financial Times he is seeking &quot;a national consensus&quot; on a policy that defers expenditure in favor of investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But consensus will prove hard to achieve in a country divided not only racially but also between urban and rural, between employed and unemployed, and between stable wage earners and the marginally employed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these tensions are present within the ANC, the largest black-led political group. Historically, ANC economic pronouncements have emphasized redistribution of income and of land, only 13% of which has been given to blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the experiences of other African countries, the changes on the world stage, and the approaching prospect of assuming a major share of governmental authority have sparked a reassessment of policy by the ANC and its allied organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an extensive evaluation of the South African economy published earlier this year, the International Monetary Fund weighed in on the debate by declaring that redistribution alone &quot;will not be adequate&quot; to offset the severity of the country's poverty. A growth-oriented economic approach is required, the IMF study concludes, &quot;to generate the resources necessary to satisfy the needs of the least privileged sectors of society on a sustained basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a major policy statement -- &quot;Guidelines for a Democratic South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa,&quot; adopted in late May by an ANC national conference -- the group endorses &quot;initiating growth and development to improve the quality of life for all South Africans, but especially for the poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the list of goals is the elimination of poverty and &quot;extreme&quot; inequality, along with &quot;democratizing the economy and empowering the historically oppressed.&quot; Those priorities reflect both the ANC's mass political base and the continuing significance of the organization's close ties to the large labor federation, Cosatu, and the South Africa Communist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The guidelines also endorse rural development as &quot;an essential component of the ANC's program for redistribution and growth&quot; and &quot;an open approach&quot; to foreign investment, &quot;in accordance with our objectives for growth and development.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

Neither the size of the new publication nor the paper on which it is printed will make it easy for us to keep it in our personal libraries for future reference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old AfricaNews was like a journal that one collects for years and refers back to on many occasions. I am still trying to figure out what I will do with the new newspaper. I am inclined to give up my subscription and just read it in the library.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Response: The preceding letters raise issues related to strategic decisions at AfricaNews, and we'd like to address them briefly. In common with virtually all publishers, we periodically allow our list to be used by other publications, although we limit such use to a few times per year. And we ourselves acquire new subscribers by sending our promotional mailings to readers of other journals. Few publications could survive without list exchanges or rentals.  However, we do honor requests from subscribers who object to their names being given to another organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our new format is part of a larger multimedia plan to make Africa News Service both economically viable and increasingly influential during its third decade. (The news agency will be 20 years old next year.) The old format was a hybrid; newsstands, distributors, contributors and potential subscribers were confused about whether it was a newsletter or a newspaper or a magazine. In addition to avoiding ambiguity, the new look allows us to give you more news and information at lower cost -- an absolute necessity for survival. While we are pained when valued subscribers dislike the changes, we must make the newspaper an indispensable publication for more people, and we must do it at a cost that won't price it out of the range of most subscribers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, the decision to accept advertising is part of the mix of revenue-generating strategies that we hope will allow AfricaNews to prosper and reach larger audiences. We always aim for our reporting to be unbiased and accurate. If we stumble in our obligation to reflect the urgent, complex issues facing Africans today, we expect to hear from you.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">560 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Congratulations on your wide-ranging article &quot;African Democracy Gets Little Notice in Washington.&quot; (AfricaNews, June 8, 1992) The Bush administration has steadfastly turned its back on the catastrophe which is overwhelming the people of Zaire. It is a disaster caused by President Bush's old friend, Mobutu Sese Seko, who was a useful &quot;client&quot; of the U.S.A. during the Cold War and during Mr. Bush's tenure as head of the CIA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this writing, President Mobutu has thrown down the gauntlet before the National Conference in Zaire, which is on the verge of trying to establish a new transitional government and elect a new prime minister. The naming of the prime minister, the president has declared, is his prerogative to exercise alone. Will the situation turn violent? Probably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past few weeks Mobutu has been quiet, even projecting the image of serenity like a tail-twitching leopard before the lethal pounce.  Realists in the opposition are convinced he was hatching his plans and preparing his moves. They know that tail-twitching in a big cat signals danger, not serenity. The few in Washington who even give Zaire a thought probably hoped -- as usual, unrealistically -- that Mobutu had seen the light and was preparing to &quot;share in government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, when a senior American senator asked the White House about Mr. Bush's continued silent support for Mobutu, he was told that the American president sees no reason to turn his back on his African colleague and is unwilling to distance himself from that relationship. How pathetic! How superficial! Foreign affairs based on cozy, personal friendships have nothing to do with statesmanship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Herman J. 'Hank' Cohen has apparently been told to keep his hands off Mobutu. Hank, whom I knew in Africa years ago when I took care of his family, is a master diplomat for the Bush White House. I am sure his calm demeanor and open ear are appreciated by many Africans. However, most are realistic enough to know that his hands are tied behind him by those higher up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States, with problems in our inner cities and an enormous national debt, may or may not have a special role to play elsewhere. But within the constraints of our own economic realities, the U.S. must back representative governments. And our government does have the responsibility to openly disassociate itself from former &quot;client dictators&quot; who have become major obstructions to democratic forces.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">694 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by William E. Phipps The southeastern African nation of Malawi, comparable in population and size to the state of Pennsylvania, gets little international attention. Foreign journalists are generally barred from entering, and few people in the United States have much information on what takes place there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hastings Kamuza Banda, the country's pro-Western leader since independence in 1963, has taken the title &quot;life president,&quot; and still rules with the firmest of hands. The Malawi Congress Party, essentially a cheering organization for the president, holds all the seats in parliament. Strikes are illegal, and free expression is not allowed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But tension in Malawi has been on the rise, especially since a pastoral letter from the country's eight Roman Catholic bishops in February criticized economic inequities and human rights abuses and called for democratic change. The government declared the letter &quot;seditious,&quot; and the Montfort Press where it was printed was attacked and smashed by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students at the University of Malawi staged protests to support the Bishop's stand, and the university was closed. The government sought to win faculty support by announcing a 50% wage hike, but that action sparked a strike by secretarial and maintenance personnel at Chancellor College, the liberal arts wing of the university, demanding comparable increases for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil servants also received pay increases to keep them from joining the growing pro-democracy cause. But strikes erupted in the textile industry, on tea plantations, and among lower-level government employees not affected by the pay hikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Malawians are desperately poor, although a tiny number of government officials live luxuriously on export earnings from tobacco, the main cash crop. Over 80% of the people are subsistence farmers. Those who are employed receive very low wages. Average per capita income is reported to be about $ 180 a year. Even primary education is not affordable or available to most children. Malawi is as hard-hit by AIDS as anyplace on earth. Over 25% of hospital patients and almost all prostitutes test HIV positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic and social problems are compounded by the hundreds of thousands of refugees from war-ravaged Mozambique next door and by the crippling drought spreading across southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing pro-democracy protests have begun to attract international concern. Western donors suspended aid last month to encourage government reforms. But there are disturbing signs that the World Bank has agreed to help fill the funding gap. The bank reportedly has approved a controversial $ 55 million hydro-electric project and is said to be considering other loans as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International has documented the torture and death of thousands of political prisoners by the Banda regime. The World Alliance of Reformed Churches, which includes the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. and the United Church of Christ, has appealed to Banda to accept far-reaching change. The Alliance's letter was co-signed by leaders of the Church of Central Africa (Presbyterian), one of Malawi's major denominations. It is time for the world to respond.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By Michael Johns &quot;Who cares about Africa?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst the politically charged debate over a &quot;new world order&quot; and &quot;America first,&quot; the unfortunate reality is: not too many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every day, Africa's human crises -- disease, famine, civil war -- quietly take the lives of thousands. Right now, drought in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan threatens the lives of no less than 23 million people -- almost one-tenth the population of the U.S.  In the coming months, many of these people will die, others will develop famine-related illnesses that ultimately will kill them, and even those who escape this current drought will undoubtedly be threatened by future ones. It is a bleak existence, where women and children suffer and die -- and almost no one notices.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lately, African crises are treated by America's national political leadership and the media as a low priority. The current drought in the Horn of Africa, for instance, has hardly broken from the back pages of any major American newspaper or received any significant television coverage. And with a few laudable exceptions, the foreign policy establishment seems to approach Africa's hardships without creativity, energy or urgency -- and often with a certain amount of cynicism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, Africa's crisis is not America's. Washington holds no inherent obligation to solve problems created by others -- and there should be no mistaking that the blame for Africa's predicament rests almost exclusively with the economic and political policies of the continent's current leaders.  Despite the end of the Cold War and talk of a &quot;democratic revolution&quot; in Africa, the continent continues -- with a few encouraging exceptions -- to be run by the politically unelected and the economically unenlightened. Economic statism, mismanagement, corruption, political autocracy -- these are the indigenous roots of the African catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, one cannot help noticing the haunting silence with which Washington has met Africa's human crisis -- a crisis whose severity is unmatched anywhere in the world today. In 1984-1985, the world, led by America, rushed to the aid of millions of starving Ethiopians. Unfortunately, much of that aid was squandered and misused by a selfish Marxist regime, but many lives were saved because of Western generosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, however, that Western spirit seems to have dissipated. The once moving story of starving Africans, which prompted music videos, benefit concerts and regular network coverage, has been reduced to mere statistics buried in seldom-read reports of human rights groups and famine relief charities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this is an indication of Africa's steady slide off the West's agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there an element of racism in Africa's neglect?  It's a fair question. Pat Buchanan has observed that, given the death of a dozen in Vilnius versus the slaughter of thousands in Burundi, American attention gravitates toward the crisis involving skin of a lighter pigmentation. Buchanan contends that this is understandable, and even appropriate, because America holds greater cultural and ethnic ties to Europe. Any objective analysis of world events would reveal that Buchanan's view is by no means a minority one. No matter how severe the human rights problems of Africa, those of Asia, Europe or Latin America consistently rise far faster on the priority list of American policy makers and the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, one cannot blame Africa's neglect on Buchanan-like xenophobia; many of Buchanan's leading critics have never uttered the word &quot;Burundi.&quot; This reflects something much deeper than racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the American policy and media elite, there exists a largely unspoken opinion that Africa is a dying horse that cannot be saved -- and that even if it can be saved, it is not worth the effort. Were it just a matter of Africa's geopolitical importance, this thinking would be more understandable (perhaps even warranted). But the message is that human rights concerns in Africa are less important than elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This represents nothing less than the politicization of human rights, and it needs correcting. There is a need for a one-yard-stick approach to human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first place to start this correction is within the American conservative movement. During the Cold War, conservatives argued that the threat of Soviet geopolitical advancements needed to be halted and, wherever possible, rolled back.  Conservatives used human rights arguments to justify an assertive foreign policy: It wasn't just that the Soviet Union had long-range nuclear missiles pointed at American cities; it also prohibited free immigration and imprisoned its dissidents. It wasn't just that the Sandinistas represented a threat to El Salvador; they also persecuted their Indian population and denied their people the right to vote. The support that was ultimately garnered for the Reagan Doctrine, and for anti-communism, was due at least in part to the fact that communism was perceived to be more than dangerous; it was also evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the Cold War won, evil does not seem to concern Americans as much anymore. As the Sudanese government starved 8 million people in the late 1980s, and as 23 million more Africans face the same fate in 1992, conservatives who justifiably railed against Cuban political prisoners and Soviet human rights violations have been hauntingly silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American liberals have been no better. Liberal Africa lobby groups, such as TransAfrica, have not spent much time or resources seeking solutions to Africa's human crises. Rather, they have been preoccupied primarily with partisan debates, especially American policy toward Angola and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In at least one respect, this is an even greater crime than conservatives' neglect of Africa. For their part, conservatives may be concerned about the mass starvation in Africa; they simply lack a consensus on how to deal with it. Most conservatives are skeptical of massive food aid missions because they often result in driving down indigenous African food prices. The result of this is that the aid may minimize the toll of a current famine, but it usually facilitates famine's return the next harvest season, because farmers are driven out of business by competition with free Western-supplied food. As a result, conservatives (when they address Africa at all) tend to place more emphasis on the long-term solution of economic reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, liberals by and large do not share this concern.  They believe in food aid as the answer to famine -- and they are far less critical than conservatives of African leaders' economic policies. But African starvation is not now even among the top ten issues of concern to liberal America. Democratic candidate Bill Clinton has not made one high-profile mention of the 23 million starving people in the Horn of Africa (much less proposed an answer to the crisis), and liberal think tanks have not placed it very high on their priority list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is Africa so neglected? One answer is that, among Africa watchers, South Africa is virtually an all-consuming area of concern.  I continually encountered this as an Africa analyst for a major conservative think tank. For example, in the fall of 1988, I gave a speech for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's human rights awareness week. I spoke for an hour about the Horn of Africa and the politics of famine. But during the question-and-answer period, question after question came not about famine in the Horn of Africa, but rather about American policy in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem rests on the shoulders of African leaders themselves.  With the exception of Angolan resistance leader Jonas Savimbi, newly elected Zambian president Frederick Chiluba and a few others, democratic African leaders, where they exist, have been by and large inept in pushing their cause in the West.  Further, most African embassies are hopelessly inefficient. They almost consistently fail (perhaps for their own self-interest) to inform Americans about the challenges and disasters in their homelands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps the greatest factor in Africa's neglect is the lack of creative thinking on Africa's problems. To the credit of the Bush administration, its Agency for International Development is at last looking anew at the role of foreign aid. (Vice President Dan Quayle put it bluntly during a speech last September in Abidjan: &quot;The age of large-scale government-to-government aid is over. Africa must develop a vigorous private sector if it is to grow.&quot;) And organizations like the National Endowment for Democracy and its affiliates are engaged in promising work to strengthen democratic institutions in Africa. But this seems to be where the thinking stops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of some tangible relevance to American security, economic or other interests, Africa's human crisis likely will continue its steady descent into oblivion. The only thing that can spare this is new thinking -- where the plight of our fellow person is not irrelevant. We need to think anew about those whose lives, because of their birthplace, consist of daily challenges of sickness, killing and starvation.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1934 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, thanks to God, thanks to the sacrifices of our martyrs and thanks to the blessings of our ancestors, the sovereign people of Mali have entrusted me with the heavy but exalted mission of guiding the destiny of our country. I am ready to assume this awesome honor. At this moment when our people are turning to a page of hope in their glorious history, I would like to greet and thank the brotherly and friendly countries that have helped us, demonstrated their solidarity and made this day possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like especially to thank their excellencies, the heads of state, the prime ministers, ministers, special envoys and foreign personalities who have greatly honored us today by coming to demonstrate their brotherhood, esteem and solidarity. The Malian people will always remember it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This day represents for us a stage in the long struggle, which our people have been waging for more than half a century now, for greater control of their own future, happiness, prosperity, in order to escape a gloomy wave of poverty, despair, exclusion and death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This day has been achieved after the bloody days in January and March 1991, after the great rallies and marches that preceded these bloody days, when the united democratic movement presented its demands on the streets of our towns. This day has been achieved following the underground struggle which many of us waged for 23 years. Today is the aftermath of our metamorphic pains. This day must bring back some memories, but it also brings a strong responsibility to make a change for the great majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an elected president of a people who have suffered and who, for several decades now, have been expecting better, I want to be the man who will bring hope. I do not want to be a peddler of illusion. I want the people to believe that with me things can change, that actions will speak louder than words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am not a father of the nation. Let me pay tribute to the fathers of our nation who have contributed to our political awareness and who have led our country to independence. I am only a son, a son among others, who is today called upon to play the elder's role without being the eldest. I need the help of everyone -- fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters -- because nothing can change all those social ties that must continue to function alongside new responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know that our people are capable of doing great things, provided that (the great things) are reconciled with the set of values that has characterized (us) historically, such as hard work, solidarity and a social creativity that has enabled us to produce active balances between individual perspectives and our collective destiny. These values also include dignity, a sense of past commitments and responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to be an instrument of reconciliation. To achieve this -- and I will commit myself resolutely to this -- democratic institutions need to be strengthened to guarantee the participation of everyone while laws are being written; a law-abiding state must ensure that the law is applied to everyone; and an active policy of social and national integration must be formulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of our priorities will be to provide social peace and stability.  It is essential that the state's authority be asserted, controlled and accepted by all. We shall ensure that the laws are known to all and that no one is above them. I will scrupulously see to the respect of the constitution, the separation of powers and the indispensable basic freedoms of the mass media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The means to this reconciliation will be the revival of our economy through the liberation of and support of individual and collective economic initiatives. Justice and solidarity must back one another to share the wealth produced. The fight against corruption and waste and the decentralization of authority will form the living framework for the participation of the greater number of people in state affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the effective accomplishment of African integration, the readiness shown by our people as early as 1960 to give up all or part of their sovereignty in favor of African unity, is irreversible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the terms of the five-year contract I have signed with the Malian people, a contract of shared, rigorous efforts. I would like it to be a contract that defines the necessary collaboration, the desirable affinities and the reciprocal responsibilities that are necessary for the harmonious development of our country. For the time being, the nation's unity depends on the successful and strict implementation of the provisions of the National Pact signed on April 11. The pact cannot exalt the victory of one group over another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It offers a chance to strengthen the democratic process. My compatriots of the northern region can count on my commitment to ensure that both peace and unity last forever. The means to this will be development, solidarity and justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National unity can also be achieved by the completion of the reconciliation of the Malian people with their army. A lot has been done in this direction, but a lot remains to be done. No democracy can be built with a worried army which has been made to feel guilty. I would hereby like to assure officers, NCOs, corporals and soldiers of our army of our complete solicitude (for them). Together we shall strengthen the republican virtues of our army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, reconciliation depends on an independent, credible and fair system of justice. Judgments will gain greater credibility. Justice also needs to be exercised in a climate of tranquillity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the next few days I will appoint a prime minister. Together we shall form a government made up of men and women from different political parties, all determined to bring changes for the improvement of people's living conditions. This arrangement seems necessary to create conditions for a genuine education in democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister will negotiate specific contracts of substance and fairness with academics, labor unions and professional organizations -- all the social partners and all the people involved in our country's development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consultation will be the watchword of our policy. I have no doubt that all the democrats who fought for the advent of a new era that would herald an improvement in people's living conditions will understand that the most serious danger that could threaten the democratic process is to demand from the state what we know it does not have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of the republic has no right to cheat our people with empty promises that will not be honored. It will, however, have to operate in accordance with the rules of discipline, good management, openness, solidarity and justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everybody knows the catastrophic heritage of the former regime; everybody is aware of the courage with which the Transition Committee for the Salvation of the People (CTSP), led by Amadou Toumani Toure, and the government of Soumana Sacko set about restoring life, confidence and health to our country. May thanks be given to them always for this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May thanks be given to Lt. Col. Amadou Toumani Toure, for whom our country's honor and the honor of his word as an officer served as a political creed and a guide for action during the 14 months in which many difficulties arose -- difficulties which his dynamic courage and patriotism managed to confront and overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chairman of the CTSP, the nation will always be grateful to you for making it understand that it has no need of a savior or a supreme guide. It will always be grateful to you for restoring confidence in the sons of Mali so that they could supervise the democratic process. In doing this, you adopted the tradition of change that is necessary for any democratic process. The lesson that you are teaching everyone will guide us. I wish you a very long life and a lot of satisfaction for you and your entire team. I am convinced that together we will always strengthen the basis for a democratic Mali. I am convinced that tomorrow you will be one of the best mediators of the country and one of the great messengers of the Malian nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I invited Malians both at home and abroad to be united more than ever before and to build a future of hope. I call upon the men and women of our country, the old and young -- yes the young -- always to defend the ideals of March 1991, which include making an effort, working and respecting others. I call on all the forces of change to show more unity, and to not confuse battles or enemies. I call on Almamy Sylla, Amadou Ali Niangado, Baba Akhib Haidara, Demba Diallo, Idrissa Traore, Moutaga Tall, Mamadou Batourou Diaby and Tieoule Konate (presidential candidates) -- all worthy representatives of our people -- and all the other political leaders to stand with us, so that together we can lift Mali up. Today is the time for practicing democracy. It is also a time for tolerance. Today, our country is shaken by different shades of opinion. This is normal for a sick person. But it is also a sign of life. Mali is a big boat and none of its occupants should want it to capsize. Mali can shake, but Mali will never capsize again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Difficulties are assailing us today. More serious tests may appear tomorrow. I am convinced that we have the means to overcome them. It is a great honor for me and my entire team to be called upon to confront these trying moments. We will face them with our people, mobilized in a calm and determined manner. Nobody will build Mali except Malians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My dear fellow citizens, today a brighter future is being launched for Mali and Africa, I hope. And I will work towards it. Long live the republic, long live democratic Mali in a united Africa.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">854 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thirty-two years after its independence, the West African nation of Mali has its first democratically elected president. Alpha Ouman Konare, a 46-year-old history professor, was sworn into office on June 8 and swiftly appointed a cabinet that includes members of three opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Konare is one of the new generation of African leaders who have been brought to power by pro-democracy movements. He was elected in April after his Alliance for Democracy in Mali swept parliamentary elections a month earlier.  His inaguration follows a 15-month transition period overseen by an interim government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in many African nations where popular uprisings are winning political reforms, democracy in Mali has been bought with a price. Hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed by Malian security forces last year, and more than a thousand were injured, before a group of army officers ended 22 years of military dictatorship in the country by overthrowing strongman president Moussa Traore. The soldiers said they had been sickened by the carnage and were moved by the courage of the protestors to turn their guns on the man who ordered the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traore is now under arrest for murder and other crimes he is charged with committing while in office. But his trial, which began June 4, has been postponed due to concern for his safety and that of other accused former officals, as well as their lawyers. Crowds of youth outside the building where the trial was being held called for Traore's punishment and threw rocks through windows. Police responded with tear gas but no injuries were reported. Konare says the trial will resume and justice will be done &quot;in a calm atmosphere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mali's transition to elections was managed by by Lt. Col. Amadou Toumani Toure, who led the overthrow of Traore, and by interim Prime Minister Soumana Sacko, a regional economist for the United Nations Development Program when he was tapped by the new ruling council to govern until free elections could be held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the inaguration, Toure cautioned that clemency and reconciliation will serve Malians better than retribution for the crimes of the past. &quot;However, the country cannot forget those who died while fighting for freedom,&quot; he said, &quot; and we will never stop paying tribute to their memory or seeing to it that their moral and physical courage live on -- by our safeguarding of the democratic ideals we now possess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malians should not try to avenge their martyrs, Toure said, &quot;because the future will not be built on vengence -- but he added that &quot;whoever caused their loss&quot; should be fairly tried and punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the inaugural ceremony, Konare praised Col. Toure for guiding Mali toward democracy and promoted him to brigadier general, making him Mali's only serving general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Konare quickly followed the example of his predecessor by appointing a technocrat, Younossi Toure, as prime minister. An economist who briefly served as planning minister under the ousted Traore, Younossi Toure has been a national director for the Central Bank of West Africa, of which Mali is a member. Interviewed by Radio France International, Konare said he had tapped Younossi Toure to head the new government because he is &quot;one of our most competent experts,&quot; as well as &quot;a committed man&quot; and &quot;a democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new government will face numerous challenges, including reforming a bloated bureaucracy, where influence peddling and corruption were commonplace. Toure, in his speech, called for accountability and efficiency among public servants. &quot;There can be no democracy without trust,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to learn to be uncompromising with the nation's interests and with public property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a reaction to African politicians who have amassed vast wealth, Mali's new constitution calls for the head of state to declare family assets.  Konare said he owns three plots of land, a house and a 13-year-old car, while his wife owns some land, some gold jewelry and a 1991 Peugeot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A primary goal of the government will be extending and strengthening the peace pact forged with nomadic Touareg rebels in the north of the country.  A truce signed in April reportedly was broken by skirmishes in early June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly appointed cabinet includes a Touareg as well as two women.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">547 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations special envoy on Western Sahara is using shuttle diplomacy to try to end a 17-year war in the former Spanish colony. Sahabzada Yakub Khan spent mid-June talking to King Hassan II of Morocco, which claims the territory, and officials of the Polisario Front, which has declared Western Sahara an independent republic. The talks were held in Geneva, in Rabat, the capital of Morocco, and in the southwestern desert of Algeria, bordering Western Sahara.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to UN sources, the envoy's trips were intended to pave the way for talks in New York later in the month. Like the Middle East peace talks, however, the two sides in the Sahara dispute will meet formally only through negotiators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since September, the UN has maintained a peacekeeping force of between 350 and 375 military observers in Western Sahara. Drawn from 25 countries, including the United States, the group was intended as an advance party for a force of nearly 3,000 that was to have supervised a ballot on the territory's future in January. But the referendum has been postponed indefinitely because of a disagreement between Morocco and Polisario over who is eligible to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report to the Security Council at the end of May, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali strongly recommended that the Council extend the peacekeepers' mandate until the end of August. &quot;It is my hope,&quot; he said, &quot;that by then substantial progress would have been made to prepare the ground for the holding of a referendum leading to the peaceful settlement of the Western Sahara conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boutros Ghali said that despite the lack of progress up to now, the UN mission has played an important role in the area. &quot;Although cease-fire violations have continued to occur and their frequency has even increased somewhat,&quot; he said, &quot;the incidents reported have not been of a violent nature; nor has there been a single battle casualty on either side since the peacekeeping force was deployed last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing a pattern the secretary-general noted in his last report to the Security Council three months ago, Morocco has been responsible for almost all the reported cease-fire violations -- in this case, 97 out of 102 since the beginning of March -- according to the report. The UN says most of the violations have involved such breaches as reinforcement of fortifications and construction of barriers and bunkers, although there often have been Moroccan overflights of Polisario positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special Representative Yakub Khan says that, in his talks with the parties, he was assured of improved cooperation in the future. Both sides say they are committed to ending the deadlock and holding the referendum.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> West African leaders are expected to meet soon to review peacekeeping operations in Liberia, where eight Senegalese soldiers have died in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans for holding an extraordinary summit to examine ways to ensure troop safety were announced by Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, current chairman of the Economic Community of West African States, which sent a combined force to end the fighting in Liberia in late 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six Senegalese died on May 28, in clashes with soldiers from the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), the armed movement led by Charles Taylor. Two more died in a June 16 road accident which left 13 others injured.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the deaths in May, Senegalese troops were withdrawn from Lofa County, the region in the northwest of the country where the clash occurred. The casualties were the first since the West African force, known as Ecomog, was deployed to Liberia's border with Sierra Leone two months ago to disarm and encamp rival factions, including the NPFL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After arriving in Liberia 22 months ago, Ecomog succeeded in separating the warring groups and ending the worst of the bloody civil strife.  But until the May deployment into NPFL territory, Ecomog operations had been limited to the capital, Monrovia, where an interim government led by President Amos Sawyer is in control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor finally accepted Ecomog expansion into the rest of the country, which his forces control, at a West African Summit in Geneva in April. The rebel leader has consistently criticized Ecomog, suggesting that the troops were sent to keep him from taking power and charging interference in Liberia's internal affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A June 14 statement issued by the Ecomog commander, Maj. Gen. Ishaya Bakut of Nigeria, said the Senegalese would be replaced in the north by troops of another nationality but did not elaborate. Nigeria and Ghana have the largest contingents in the 7,000-strong peacekeeping force. The Senegalese contingent was added to Ecomog last year at Taylor's request, to dilute the influence of Nigeria, which has been the particular target of his criticism.  Senegal says its troops will remain part of the peacekeeping effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deployment of Ecomog along Liberia's border with Sierra Leone was intended to halt recent attacks on NPFL forces by another armed faction, the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (Ulimo). &quot;There seems little doubt that it is Ulimo's military successes against the NPFL, as much as the Geneva accord, that have led to improved cooperation between Ecomog and NPFL at the start of the deployment exercise,&quot; the London-based newsletter Africa Confidential said recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six Senegalese deaths occurred after a shootout erupted in the northern town of Vahun. Although the soldiers were reported originally to have been &quot;kidnapped&quot; by NPFL forces, Senegal's Ministry for Armed Forces said June 8 that the soldiers had been &quot;killed in a cowardly manner well after the clashes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Ecomog statement said that Maj. Gen. Bakut had been assured by Taylor that he was &quot;committed to facilitating&quot; the work of the Ecomog force. &quot;I hope your words of commitment will be honored this time,&quot; the statement from Bakut said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">827 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A visit to Washington, DC, in late June by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni provoked calls for an examination of Uganda's human rights and political record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. John Edward Porter (D-IL), writing on behalf of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, which he co-chairs, called on the Bush administration to query Museveni on his plans for democratization and his treatment of political opponents. Although on a private visit, Museveni was scheduled to hold talks with Secretary of State James Baker III. Plans for a meeting with President George Bush fell through when the White House was unable to find time on Bush's agenda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ugandan people have a right to democracy, political pluralism and internationally recognized standards of human rights,&quot; Porter said in a June 15 letter to Bush, asking that the administration &quot;make it clear&quot; that the U.S.  will &quot;carefully monitor&quot; progress in these areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to reports that Museveni has arrested dozens of political opponents and members of banned political parties, Porter raised a concern &quot;that these arrests represent a coordinated effort by President Museveni to destroy political opposition and ensure his position as unopposed ruler of Uganda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to Museveni's arrival, a U.S.-based opposition group known as the Uganda Democratic Coalition issued a call for a cut-off in American aid to Uganda. Citing the examples of Kenya, Zaire and Malawi, which have suffered aid losses due to alleged human rights violations, the coalition condemned what it said is a &quot;double standard&quot; for Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the coalition, Museveni's regime has been responsible for killing, detaining and forcing into exile political opponents and murdering thousands of civilians since coming to power at the end of a military struggle in 1986. Museveni's victory followed several years of political instability after the overthrow of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent criticism of government actions by both local and international human rights groups, including Amnesty International, resulted in an official inquiry into reports that government troops were responsible for atrocities against local residents in north and northeastern Uganda, where various anti-government rebel groups continue to operate. A May 21 report issued by the Justice Minister and Attorney-General Abubakar Mayanja confirmed that the government's National Resistance Army (NRA) has been responsible for excesses and said that disciplinary action against the officers involved will be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, prepared by a government ombudsman, also criticized authorities for the arrest last year of a former prime minister, Daniel Omara Atubo, along with members of parliament; two senior officials of the Democratic Party, Zachary Olum and Ojok Mulozi; the National Liberation Party leader, Tiberio Okenyi; and 18 others on charges of treason and sedition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, Ugandan courts acquitted Olum, Mulozi, Okenyi, Atubo and 13 others. Two cases were withdrawn for lack of evidence. Mayanja said treason charges will be dropped against hundreds of others because arrests were made unlawfully.  During the May 29 trial of Olum, Mulozi and Okenyi, the judge said the scarcity of evidence presented by prosecutors seemed to indicate the defendants had been held for political reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Ugandan state radio announced June 9 that the government plans to severely trim the size of the army, reported to be anywhere from 80,000 to 100,000, despite a June 6 attack by rebels in the northeast township of Bukedea in which eight people were killed. The move follows pressure from the World Bank and Western donors to cut defense expenditures, now that insurgencies in the north and northeast are largely under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Agence France-Presse, some observers believe the changes in the Ugandan government's attitude, as evidenced by the ombudsman's report and the recent rash of acquittals, reflects the impact of pressure from Western donors. In mid-May, a donor group chaired by the director of the World Bank Eastern Africa Department pledged $ 830 million in aid for Uganda but warned that continued human rights violations could jeopardize future assistance.</SPAN></P>

The creeping collapse appeared to signal the end of a bold plan to foster news exchanges among African countries and to ease Africa's dependence on news that is written and produced by agencies outside the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a multinational committee, set up by African information ministers to study the Pana crisis, plans to submit a proposal for a restructured continent-wide news agency to the summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in early July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pana owes Senegalese telecommunications and utility companies over $ 1 million and has been unable to pay a $ 15,000 bill for transmissions to London that is owed to a telecommunications firm in neighboring Gambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten employees have resigned and only nine of 16 on the editorial staff remain at the Dakar headquarters. Staff members who have stayed go to work but have nothing to do. All have gone unpaid for at least six months, and some have not received full salaries for nearly a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pana was established by African governments in 1979 with the hope that it could promote regional integration and cooperation in Africa. Its stated purposes reflect the widespread dissatisfaction with the continent's reliance on reporting by powerful international institutions such as British, French and American wire services. The fledgling news agency was asked to &quot;correct the distorted image of Africa, its countries, peoples and culture&quot; and to provide information about the struggle of Africa's peoples &quot;against all forms of exploitation and oppression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pana's existence gave hope to Africans who were dismayed at what they saw as scant or ill-informed coverage of the continent's complex realities by journalists from abroad. Africans who agreed on little else have long argued that the foreign press tends to see Africa as a primitive place, where almost every conflict can be explained by tribalism and every problem is an example of African incompetence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pana also was charged with assisting the development of national news agencies in individual countries and was expected to establish a data bank on Africa as well as a photo service to serve African media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the beginning, though, Pana has been an idea which didn't work in practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immediate crisis was caused by the failure of African governments to pay some $ 18 million in arrears to Pana. From the time that the idea of a continent-wide agency was proposed at the founding summit of the OAU in 1963, it was expected that governments would foot the bills. But only about five countries have paid their assessments fully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some countries have never even paid anything since the start,&quot; says Victor Olufemi Adefela, Pana's news director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pana was intended to be a clearinghouse that linked, as well as supplemented, the work of Africa's national news agencies. It gathered news and information; translated it into Arabic, French and English; and redistributed the results to subscribers and member agencies around the continent. There are five regional pool centers to facilitate the collection and dissemination process: Tripoli, Tunisia, for North Africa; Lusaka, Zambia, in Southern Africa; Khartoum, Sudan, for East Africa; Lagos, Nigeria, for West Africa; and Kinshasa, Zaire, for the central area. There are bureaus in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Harare, Zimbabwe, and correspondents are based in London, Paris and New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its peak, Pana distributed about 80 news stories -- up to 25,000 words -- daily. The continent's major media have used large amounts of material from the agency, which has been one of the few sources for stories about African development issues, environmental concerns and the role of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News director Adefela argues that Pana has achieved &quot;a good measure of success&quot; in its aim of highlighting important African news that the international press corps doesn't cover. Before the African agency was established, he says, African countries learned nearly everything they knew about each other -- and all too often, about events in their own countries -- from foreign media. Much of the coverage was limited to disasters and emergencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But cooperation from Pana's constituency has been spotty and sporadic.  &quot;There are a number of countries which participate (only) from time to time,&quot; Adefela says. &quot;Some have never participated. Countries like Comoros or Mauritius haven't sent anything for the last two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adefela concedes that &quot;our success has been minimal in efforts to project a more accurate coverage of Africa&quot; to other parts of the world, because there was no method for distribution outside the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there was a structural problem inherent in the agency's constitution, according to Salim Lone, editor of the United Nations publication, Africa Recovery. &quot;It is vital for Africa and indeed for every world region to have news organizations which can reflect their concerns and interests,&quot; Lone says. &quot;Unfortunately, Pana was never able to make significant headway in this area, primarily because of limited freedom and autonomy.&quot; Because it was linked to government-owned news agencies, Lone says, Pana was not free to report fully and accurately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That limitation became particularly apparent in the past two years, as democracy movements have challenged or toppled dozens of authoritarian regimes across the continent. Governments under attack have tried to ignore or trivialize opposition forces, and government-owned news agencies have done the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, many of the struggles for democracy have been reported by independent journalists -- unaffiliated with government agencies -- who are employed directly by Pana. And the fact that international media are largely ignoring these dramatic developments is yet another sign of the need for an African news agency, supporters of the idea say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rescue Attempt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a late April meeting in the Nigerian capital Abuja, Africa's information ministers established a six-nation task force to explore the possibilities of reviving and restructuring Pana. &quot;We are convinced that changes and new trends in the continent necessitate a rethinking of the operational, managerial and legal framework of Pana,&quot; the ministers said in a resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida told the meeting that the need for a pan-African agency has not abated. &quot;The relationship of dependence is still very strong,&quot; he said. &quot;Disparities in infrastructure and imbalances in the international flow of information persist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task force is chaired by Nigeria, with representatives from Cameroon, Senegal, Egypt, Zimbabwe and Uganda and has been working in cooperation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco). The group has prepared a broad outline for a three-unit organization: a foundation which will set policy and raise funds, a telecommunications entity to distribute news and a professional, independent journalistic arm. The enterprise would invite private investors, and governments would be limited to a 20% share in the venture. Private interests could control no more than half the shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the plan, if the OAU approves the idea in principle, the task force will prepare a final plan of operation by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with the best plans, however, resuscitating Pana will be a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To operate on a commercial basis will be extremely hard,&quot; says Salim Lone, &quot;because there isn't much international interest in Africa. And the African countries, who would be the main users of the information, are in such a financial crisis that they will be unable to afford the money required to make the agency a success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Lone thinks the effort is worthwhile. Democratic reforms in Africa have been accompanied by an upsurge of independent newspapers. In Cote d'Ivoire, for example, dozens of new journals have appeared in the last year. But the young publications need both information and training of the sort that an effectively functioning news agency could provide.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Cindy Shiner n Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mobutu Sese Seko has reiterated his refusal to ease his 27-year grip on power and yield authority to a national democracy conference representing the country's political, civic and religious organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's intransigence has raised tensions in the capital and increased fears that widespread violence will recur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement read over national TV and radio on June 15, Mobutu said that only the president has the right to name a prime minister. He also said that the national conference is not empowered to make constitutional changes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than two thousand delegates have been meeting on and off since last August with the goal of drafting a new constitution and choosing a transitional government leading to free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference has declared itself sovereign from Mobutu and the unpopular administration of his appointee, Prime Minister Nguza Karl i Bond. In recent weeks, delegates have been moving towards selecting a new prime minister and revising the country's one-party constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's statement sparked protest in this capital, where hundreds took to the streets and some attacked cars thought to be carrying government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mobutu's speech was very dangerous for the political future of Zaire,&quot; said Ngefa Apondoko, president of Zaire's Association for the Defense of Human Rights. &quot;From the bread sellers to the intellectuals, everyone was angry. They wanted to loot the homes of the ruling party politicians and march to the people's palace,&quot; where the conference is being held, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During nearly three decades in power, Mobutu has ruled with an iron fist and accumulated a personal fortune that makes him one of the world's richest people. The country itself, despite vast mineral resources, is bankrupt and largely unable to function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roman Catholic Archbishop Monsengwo Pasinya, the conference chairman, appealed for calm after the president's speech. He denied that the president can bar the conference from nominating a prime minister and said that the conference's legal framework authorizes delegates to choose a transitional government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people have suffered greatly,&quot; said Monsengwo. &quot;A new government needs to be implemented as soon as possible.&quot; With public frustration mounting, Monsengwo planned a trip to Europe and the U.S. to draw attention to the crisis and enlist support for keeping the democracy conference afloat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Zaire's economic situation continues to worsen. Inflation is out of control. The country's currency, the zaire, has dropped to a new low. To keep pace, the government treasury recently issued a 500,000 zaire note, the largest in circulation. But by mid-June, one U.S. dollar could buy 500,000 zaires on the illegal currency market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public servants earn an average wage of 4 million zaires per month, which is currently equivalent to about eight U.S. dollars. A large stack of manioc -- a staple food for most Zaireans -- costs about 6 million zaires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country where unemployment is already an estimated 80%, about 1,500 more Zaireans stand to lose their jobs if the government does not reverse a recent seizure of petroleum assets of major foreign oil companies operating in Zaire. &quot;If the situation goes on, next we will lay off all our people,&quot; says a major oil company executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-owned oil company, Petro-Zaire, has said it requisitioned the foreign oil firms' stocks in early June to keep the price of petroleum down. Petro-Zaire has promised to reimburse companies for their losses. But the oil executive said it hasn't happened. &quot;We haven't gotten anything,&quot; he said. &quot;All the cash they got from the gas stations is going straight to Petro-Zaire, and we don't know what they are doing with the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says Shell, Mobil and other foreign firms are losing about $ 30,000 a day because of the seizure. &quot;This is pure theft,&quot; he says. &quot;We don't have any revenue; how can we survive?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are pretty sure now that (the government) doesn't have the money to pay for the stock of products,&quot; says Georges Fensie, a spokesman for Gulf Oil, which imports petroleum products to Zaire and stands to lose up to $ 10 million dollars because of the seizure.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Carole Collins and Colin Darch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa achieved limited gains at the recently concluded United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Unced) in Rio. But the emergence of African non-governmental organizations (NGO) onto the international scene may mark a turning point in their influence on the world's ecology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs made their voices heard during the official Unced deliberations -- held at a plush high-security conference center 20 miles outside of town -- and at the parallel Global Forum organized by the world's environmental activists in a beach-front park near the city center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Unced deliberations, discussion of well-honed drafts developed during months of preparatory meetings was more or less business-as-usual for African government delegations well versed in UN-style politics. At the more informal NGO-based Global Forum, relatively inexperienced African groups had some much-needed exercise in international diplomacy, negotiating and lobbying.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although 30 African heads of state were among the continent's delegations at the official Unced meeting, only 16 African countries had NGO representatives at the forum. And of 791 NGOs at Unced, only 230 were from the poor nations of the southern hemisphere. Still, at both the forum -- where they were lost among almost 8,000 participating groups from 187 countries -- and at Unced, African NGOs played what was perhaps their most assertive role ever at a world-level meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the forum, NGOs joined an open discussion process that produced 33 different agreements or &quot;treaties&quot; on a wide-range of environmental topics. In addition, the African NGOs issued a hard-hitting document, The Rio Declaration on Eradication of Poverty in Africa, which summarized their concerns for the future. The document attacks governments for having lost &quot;the will to deal with the principal causes of environmental degradation,&quot; which the paper identifies as militarization, over-consumption, exploitative trade patterns and unfair and coercive financial systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many official Unced delegations, confronted with the complicated issues of environmental policies and practices, called upon NGO activists for their specific and extensive expertise. NGO leaders such as Sam Moyo of the Zimbabwe Energy Resources Organization, Benjamin Makunzy Valerie of Angola's Programa Humanitario para Criancas Orfas (Humanitarian Program for Orphans) and others played active roles as technical advisors for their countries' official delegations. Valerie, for example, not only represented his own organization and assisted Angola's official delegation, but also represented a new national NGO forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through their various contributions, African NGOs showed that their conspicuous lack of experience on the international negotiating and diplomatic scene was not to be confused with a shortage of expertise on the environmental issues facing their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the central preoccupations of Africa's official Unced delegations was that the spread of deserts be recognized as a global problem rather than just an African concern. This notion was part of a common position, worked out under the auspices of the UN Economic Commission for Africa and the Organization of African Unity in November 1991. Over 45% of the world's deserts are located in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite some last-minute objections, Unced delegations agreed to set up an Inter-Governmental Negotiating Committee to hammer out an international convention on drought and desertification control, in a process similar to that which produced the recent conventions on climate change and biodiversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Agreeing to develop a convention on desertification was a high African priority,&quot; says Raymond Kwerepe, a rangeland ecologist at Botswana's Ministry of Agriculture. But former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, attending as an informal advisor to Unced Secretary-General Maurice Strong, sees hard work still ahead. &quot;Africans were specifically concerned with desertification, and that is now being taken seriously and accepted&quot; he says.  &quot;We will have to sit down together and tackle the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African heads of state joined others from the poor nations of the southern hemisphere in stressing the importance of poverty as a central factor fueling environmental degradation. African environmentalists say economic issues come to center stage wherever soil is eroded from the marginal land that poor farmers must try to cultivate, or when forests are cut for firewood or fresh water is polluted around population centers. &quot;Beyond the screaming headlines of the 'loud' environmental emergencies such as global warming,&quot; says Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, &quot;there are the silent environmental emergencies that affect the daily lives of millions in the world. The 'loud' emergencies have yet to affect many people. But the silent emergencies, the more immediate issues of human survival, are already wasting many lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwinyi says another obstacle to southern efforts to preserve the environment is &quot;the compulsive pressure imposed on us to maximize export production and foreign exchange earnings to meet external debt service payments of more than twice our annual per capita income. He says international debt precludes &quot;the opportunity for placing poor economies on a sustainable path.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of the newer African NGOs, Rio was more of a learning experience than one that produced concrete outcomes. Mamadou Saliou Diallo, of Guinea-Ecologie, says his contact with other NGOs taught him much about how to appeal credibly to potential funders. Angola's Valerie agrees, saying that for him one of the main shocks of the meeting was learning how poor his organization's funding proposals had been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several African NGOs noted continuing tensions and gaps of understanding between organizations in the industrialized northern hemisphere and the countries of the south. N'nenna Eluna, an NGO advisor to the Nigerian delegation, who represented the Women's Employment and Environmental Project, notes that while northern NGOs tend to work on &quot;problems from a slightly abstract point of view,&quot; NGOs in poorer countries, whose members are &quot;mainly indigenous people,&quot; tend to start &quot;from the problem base&quot; on such issues as &quot;poverty, desertification and working against the extinction of species.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prisca Molotsi of the Zambia Alliance of Women agrees. &quot;We in Africa,&quot; she says, &quot;tend to rely too much on donors from the West, rather than networking with NGOs from other parts of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that democracy is a necessary precondition for saving the planet rode a strong current at the Global Forum and at Unced. Democracy is needed not only within nations, but also between them, Niko Bessinger, Namibia's minister of wildlife, conservation and tourism, told fellow statesmen. Bessinger called for &quot;the democratization of our country, the planet, where the weak and the small and the impoverished share fully in (the political) process.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

The attackers beat her &quot;expertly, so it left no trace&quot; and stole money and clothes &quot;to make it look like robbery,&quot; the minister says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uwilingiyimana, who is from the south, says her attackers belong to President Juvenal Habyarimana's National Republic Movement for Democracy and Development, based in the north. The president says he is sure the May 7 attack was banditry and was not politically motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some southerners in the opposition-dominated transitional government see the attack as part of a campaign by Habyarimana to sabotage a promised transition to democracy and to keep the powers that have enabled him to favor northerners for almost a decade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials from the faction headed by John Garang, based in the town of Torit, and a breakaway group, based in the town of Nasir, announced in mid June that they would reunite on the battlefield, once they agree on a new structure for the rebel movement, who would lead the SPLA and how it would deal with human rights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nasir faction broke from the Torit faction last August over what its leaders described as human rights violations by Garang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two factions united at the bargaining table in early June during peace talks in Nigeria. Both pressed the government, dominated by Arabic-speaking Muslims, for self-determination for the south, which is populated mainly by Christian or animist Africans. The Torit faction had previously pushed for an end to Sharia, or Islamic law.  The government has offered autonomy for the south within a federal system and exemption from Sharia for non-Muslim areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The split in the SPLA has contributed to recent battlefield gains by government troops, who have occupied 13 rebel-held towns in the biggest dry season offensive since the civil war began in 1983. Military ruler Omar Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir has vowed government troops will soon take Torit, the last major town held by Garang's faction. Rebels seized the garrison center of Juba, the largest city in the south, for a couple of hours in early June, but government troops soon regained control.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trial judge in late June affirmed the decision of three court assessors that accusations against Jonah Tajeu Magiroi, 28, and Peter Metui Kipeen, 26, were based on circumstantial evidence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Fidahussein Abdallah said a game warden, a revenue clerk and a police constable also suspected of the murder should have been investigated further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors had contended that Magiroi and Kipeen kidnapped Ward, 28, raped her at their Makari game post, killed her, chopped up her body and tried to burn the remains. Kenyan authorities initially said Ward was killed by wild animals, but pursued the case further after a detective hired by the woman's father uncovered evidence of murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 50-member United Nations military observer team is expected to arrive this week in Mogadishu, the strife-torn capital of Somalia, to monitor a cease-fire between two rival warlords. But an exodus that has sent about 800,000 Somalis to neighboring countries, most recently in crowded, poorly supplied boats bound for Yemen, continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are fleeing shortages of food, continued lawlessness in the capital, drought and fighting. In the north, factions in the self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland are struggling for power. In the south, the forces of Gen. Mohamed Aidid Farrah, one of the Mogadishu warlords, are battling supporters of former President Mohammed Siad Barre, who was overthrown by Aidid and others in January 1991 and driven over the Kenya border in April.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Siad's overthrow, Somalia has splintered along ethnic lines into armed groups fighting for local control. The most intense battles have taken place in the capital, between Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, named the country's president by several factions. The 50 unarmed military observers are supposed to monitor a March cease-fire declared between Aidid and Mahdi. Aidid has not yet agreed to let the UN send a 500-soldier armed force to Mogadishu to guard relief supplies and convoys which are often attacked in this city where people are starving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estimates of the number dying of hunger in the capital range from 30 per day to 5,000 per day. Whatever the exact figure, the UN says about 4.5 million face starvation across Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 400,000 Somalis are refugees in Ethiopia, several hundred thousand are in Kenya, 90,000 are in Djibouti and 12,000 are in Yemen, according to the latest update from the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 4,000 of the most recent Somali refugees are camped on beaches in Yemen, after crossing the Indian Ocean in two boats with inadequate food and water for the many days spent waiting at sea for permission to land. On the larger of the boats, more than 150 died of dehydration, heat stroke and cholera, were murdered by shipboard bandits, or perished trying to swim to land before authorities allowed them ashore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More boatloads of refugees are reportedly bound for Yemen, Kenya and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>

The move came after attacks on Coptic Christians and security forces.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 5,000 heavily armed police in river boats and armored personnel carriers descended on Egypt's southern Asyut province, sealing off roads, setting up checkpoints and storming the houses of suspected extremists. They searched most intensively in and around the village of Dayrut, a center of militant activity about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south of Cairo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crackdown followed three months of conflict in Asyut province, where more than 20 people, most of them Copts, died as a result of violence between Christians and Muslims. Each group makes up about half of the region's population of 1.5 million people. Both Christian and Muslim clerics have called for an end to the fighting.</SPAN></P>

In a June 27 speech President Hassan Gouled Aptidon announced an amnesty for guerrillas fighting government troops and also announced the release of 14 members of the rebel Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A moderate opposition leader, in Paris for a meeting to explore ways to set up a united political front, called the government's moves &quot;positive.&quot; But he said opposition parties have not decided whether to participate in the September 4 referendum. Several opposition parties charge that the government, which is dominated by members of the Issa ethnic group, is planning to win the national elections it scheduled for November 20 by registering Ethiopian Issas as Djibouti voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRUD's members mostly are from the Afar ethnic group and have been fighting a guerrilla war against the army since late last year. The president said restrictions on movement around the two towns in the center of the conflict have been lifted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France has dropped its call for a national conference in Chad, reportedly because the military government of Chadian President Idriss Deby is considered too weak to weather the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest challenge to Deby's authority came in mid June with the discovery of a coup plot by Public Works Minister Abbas Kotti, who has fled to an as yet unidentified neighboring country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kotti was the leader of a March protest by soldiers against proposed cuts in the army.  During the protest, soldiers in tanks surrounded the presidential palace. After the plan to overthrow Deby was uncovered, clashes between rebels and the army in the Lake Chad region north of N'Djamena, the capital, killed 103 Kotti supporters and ten of Deby's soldiers, according to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deby has faced opposition from armed groups throughout Chad since he came to power in December 1990 by overthrowing former dictator Hissene Habre, whom he once served as defense minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reportedly worried that Deby's regime would not survive a national conference that included attacks by Habre supporters and angry soldiers, France now favors the formation of a national unity government in order to establish democracy in Chad. Deby recently appointed as prime minister a former minister of planning and reconstruction under Habre, Joseph Yodoyman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deby had promised to convene a national conference in May to draft a new constitution and establish a multiparty system. That conference was not held, but five political parties have been registered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ugandan government and business partners plan to turn the East African nation into a substantial producer of cobalt, by using bacteria to extract the economically important metal from waste dumps at an old copper mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has recently signed a $ 54 million agreement with Barclays Metals of the United Kingdom and Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM), a state-owned French mining group, to do a feasibility study and construct a cobalt extraction plant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since copper production at the Kilembe mine in southwest Uganda stopped in 1972, trial methods to recover cobalt from the waste dumps have been rejected as either too expensive or too polluting. But BRGM has developed a new method that avoids those problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project is supposed to contribute about five percent of the world's output of cobalt by 1995, producing at least 1,000 tons of the metal annually for 15 years. Zambia and Zaire now account for about 70% of production worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cobalt is essential to the manufacture of several superalloys used in the aerospace industry and for various products used by the automobile industry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 71-member delegation from the United States participated in the Joint International Observer Group for Ethiopia's elections, under the auspices of the New York-based African-American Institute (AAI).  Four days after the voting took place, AAI issued the following statement, with contributions from nearly all members of the American contingent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 21, 1992, Ethiopia held what was to be the first truly democratic elections in its history. The Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) had great expectations that these district and regional elections would set the stage for national elections projected to take place in 1993. The primary political purpose of these elections was, according to the National Charter, to &quot;empower&quot; through the vote all of Ethiopia's nationalities within a new pluralistic political system. However, this first round of elections fell considerably short of this objective.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than a week before the election, the Oromo People's Liberation Front (OLF), undeniably a significant political party in the South, as well as other parties including the All-Amhara People's Organization (AAPO), the Ethiopian Democratic Action Group (EDAG), the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Oromia (IFLO), and the Gideo People's Democratic Organization (GPDO), announced their withdrawal from the process. Together the partisans of these organizations represent a significant proportion of the Ethiopian electorate.  Moreover, the provocative movement of Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Force (EPRDF) troops throughout the election process, combined with the OLF's decision to decamp approximately 15,000 fighters immediately after withdrawing from election, raised the prospects of a return to armed conflict in the Oromo region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bases of the OLF complaint were that the National Election Commission had not followed Proclamation 11, calling for the establishment and management of electoral committees; that OLF offices were arbitrarily closed in some areas; and that prospective candidates were detained without reason. In partial response to growing charges of procedural irregularities, the day before the election, the Council of Representatives ordered that in those locations where serious administrative problems were found to exist, the voting period would be extended by up to a week, while in those areas where there were enduring political obstacles, elections would be postponed indefinitely and these problems would be investigated and resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the rest of the country the elections did go on as planned. The results were mixed, with some parts of the North, including Addis Ababa and other major urban centers experiencing what appeared to be procedurally regular elections. Here some voters were enthusiastic about their opportunity to vote in these historic elections, and hopeful for a democratic future. In other places, such as the Afar and Somali regions, the charter city of Harar, and eastern and western Oromo areas, for various reasons elections were postponed indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In very few places were there competitive, multiparty elections. The EPRDF and its affiliated parties (e.g. EPDM, OPDO, etc.) were usually the only parties on the ballot. Non-participation was explained both as a response to intimidation and detention of supporters and candidates, or alternately as an expression of a party's unwillingness to participate in the electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rural and peri-urban areas of the north and central areas of Ethiopia, as well as in most parts of the South, there were serious problems in the election process. These problems were in part administrative and in part political. Among the administrative problems were the failure to constitute bona fide local and regional election committees in the manner specified by Proclamation 11; poor communications up and down the electoral commission hierarchy; the failure to deliver registration and voting materials on time; and, inadequate and/or delayed funding for election committees. Another serious problem had to do with the failure of election officials to adequately educate the population about the purpose of the ballot and the procedures for casting their votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political problems were no less daunting. Where EPRDF controlled local administration (particularly in the South and East), it was not uncommon for electoral and local administrative officials to prevent candidates and voters from opposition parties from registering. In some cases those who refused to state their ethnicity or referred to themselves simply as Ethiopians were prevented from registering, notwithstanding a decision on the part of the ministry of justice that individuals could indeed refer to themselves as &quot;Ethiopian&quot; without violating any laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the elections, political intimidation and harassment were reported in most parts of the country. In addition, violence and fraud were reported in such areas as Dire Dawa, Harar, parts of Shoa, Dembi Dolo, Awasa, and elsewhere. In most cases, the allegations were made against local administrators and the EPRDF-based government. In others, they were made against opposition parties such as the OLF in Wollega.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transitional Government of Ethiopia, in accordance with the 1991 Charter, has begun to open up the political system. There is now more freedom of political expression than ever before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much needs to be done before the system is truly democratic. A strengthening of electoral institutions, along with the political and mutual restraint of all parties, are of the highest priority. A major shortcoming of the whole process appears to be that the government tried to do too much too soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say that some progress has not been made. Many Ethiopians spoken to by the AAI observers expressed fervent yearnings for peace and democracy. One can only hope that immediate steps are taken to avert further bloodshed and that these admittedly imperfect elections contribute toward peace and the advance of a democratic process.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday, June 19 -- The briefing we received yesterday included some hopeful signs: in some trouble spots, registration sites that had been closed by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF ) have been reopened; some political detainees were freed. Someone mentions, &quot;everyone has guns.&quot; Security for the observers takes on a new meaning. We are made as &quot;official&quot; as possible -- we have Joint International Observers Group (JIOG) photo identification badges to wear on visits, we are encouraged to wear the official JIOG tee shirts we have been issued, our vehicles have the JIOG symbol prominently displayed, we have letters of introduction in three different languages. Interpreters travel with us, though many people speak English very well.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country is divided into 14 election districts, divided primarily along ethnic lines. This helps to ensure representation of all groups. We visit four urban kebeles, the Ethiopian equivalent of a precinct or ward, in Addis Ababa and one rural peasant association. The election committees are cooperative. They answer our questions thoroughly and make their records available to us. One even offered a guide to help us find the rural peasant association. We encounter two candidates campaigning. Tadele Bitul Kibrat, an engineer educated in the U.S. and Canada, is running for district office, but has much higher political aspirations. He is setting his sights on running the country one day. He carries a thick notebook detailing his lifelong struggle for democracy and justice. He proudly shows a photocopy of a letter he wrote opposing Haile Selassie's nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. He is encouraged by the election process. However, there are no opposition candidates for his office, and he is assured of election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we visit the rural peasant association we notice the first hint of a problem. Looking through the registration book there are a group of pages where all the registrants signed on the same day from the same ethnic group, and they all had resided in the area for the same length of time. Are we witnessing mass fraud? Apparently not. We are presented with a very plausible explanation: the entries were made when members of the army who live in the area came en masse to register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we journey back toward town our guide proudly points out his kebele and invites us to visit. I'm pleased to see the election committee is composed of three women. The women tells us they are educating the public about the voting process and the candidates. They show us a room with posters listing all the candidates and some individual campaign flyers. On the wall beneath the Ethiopian candidates is a bumper sticker: it reads &quot;Ross Perot for President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday, June 20 -- All of our time is spent in urban kebeles. We witness community meetings where the voting process is explained. Voters who cannot read or write can still participate. Each candidate has been assigned a symbol; voters indicate their choice by signing their name or by placing their thumbprint next to the appropriate symbol. I ask about the percentage of women who have registered; in many places over 50% of those registered are female. We meet several candidates for local and regional seats, and we see our first example of campaigning. A decorated pick-up truck equipped with a bullhorn is cruising the streets. Our interpreter informs us that the message is not for a specific candidate; the message is from the EPRDF calling for party unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kebeles we have visited have each registered over 2,000 voters.  All of the voting will be manual, and many people cannot read or write.  Suddenly the enormity of situation hits us -- this will be a long, slow process.  The election committees have not thought out how to get people in and out quickly. Will the voters have the tenacity to stick it out, waiting long hours in the sun? Are the election officials prepared to handle hundreds of people who may show up all at once? Is it fair for us to expect an essentially rural society to manage a complex election system? Should we evaluate it as we would in a more industrialized society?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally some ballots arrive, but it's after 4:00 p.m. The local election committee is quickly sorting the ballots. They must be delivered tonight -- quite a feat considering there are only two cars available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back at the hotel, the U.S. group meets to discuss issuing a joint statement. Some members are back from visits in the countryside. I hear talk of sabotage, intimidation, mistrust among parties, arrests, murders, reluctance on the part of voters. Are things that different in Addis than in other districts? Have I really misread what is happening at the sites I have visited? Obviously the process is not perfect but it appears to be working. After all, only a year ago peace was really new in a country that had been engaged in armed conflict for so long. Dare we even suggest that major progress is not being made?  Certainly the democratic process has a long way to go, but the government has made an effort to extend the political process to all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday, June 21 -- I'm at kebele 14 when the polls open at 7:00 a.m. Already there is confusion, as all previous communications set the opening of the polls for 6:00 a.m. There are 84 people seated orderly in a small auditorium. We inspect the private voting booths, each with a listing of all the candidates and posters for the candidates and their platforms. It takes the committee almost 30 minutes to explain the process. It is now 7:50; there are almost 200 people in the auditorium. Outside there are two armed members of the Peace and Security Committee, a police force elected by members of the kebele.  I did not find their low-key presence menacing.  With much ceremony the first vote is cast by the local priest from the Coptic Church. When he emerges from the voting booth his right index finger is dabbed with indelible ink to prevent voting a second time. Here, it looks like the process is working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I join a group who journey to Debre Zeit, a town 31 miles (50 kilometers) south of Addis. We stop at two kebeles on the way. There are long lines at both stops, and the voting seems to take forever. I am impressed that there are so many women waiting to vote. We make three stops in Debre Zeit, a town where the Oromo people are the dominant ethnic group. The Oromo Liberation Front has withdrawn from the elections, but it does not appear that many people are honoring the boycott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one polling place, a radio provides entertainment for those waiting to vote. There are not many sites where seats are being contested by opposition candidates or independents, but that does not appear to have deterred many voters. The turnout is steady and people seem committed to wait it out for their turn to vote. I speak to a local candidate who represents the EPRDF. I ask him why he is running. He says he is not sure. Is he a pawn of the party?  Or does he not understand my question posed in English? We have a flat tire and a group of young men stop to help us. I ask if they are registered to vote, and they answer yes; but none have voted. A 19-year-old who is studying to be a mechanic gives me a long, rambling answer about why he did not vote. His English is good, but still it is difficult for me to understand his answer. He suggests there is not enough choice, and he does not feel the emphasis of ethnicity helps encourage the sense of unity Ethiopia needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I go back to my original polling spot at 6:30 p.m. There are more than a hundred people in line. The committee says the polls will remain open as long as there are voters in line. Another observer visits at 10:30 p.m., and the voting continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday, June 22 -- Controversy.  Some polls closed on time the night before with the thought that the voting would continue on Monday morning.  However, no provision has been made for this, and people are told to go home.  We hear that in some kebeles hundreds are in line this morning. We hear of others where people were in line until very late Sunday night. There is serious confusion. There has been no official communication on how to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We go to kebele 22 to observe the counting of ballots. The room with the ballots is locked and sealed. Bold adhesive bands on the windows and doors are complete with the signatures and seals of the election committee. I have no doubt that these ballots are secure. We witness the opening of the room and the beginning of the counting process. There are almost too many witnesses to the process. Observers from the district committee, ten policemen, all of the candidates, four JIOG observers and the election committee all crowded into the room. Each ballot is shown to the group before it is officially counted. Over 1500 people voted here. The counting will take a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. delegation gets together again to try to formulate a consensus statement of our impressions. More people are back from the outlying areas, and again there are differing views of the process and what actually took place. Because the elections were postponed in some parts of the country -- because of administrative and political irregularities -- it is difficult to put closure to what happened. Some observers note the low key mood of the voters and contrast the calm to the excitement in Zambia where voters chanted with enthusiasm the coming of the paper ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think back to home and my urban precinct in my model university town. We've had 200 years of election experience in the U.S. and many offices go unchallenged.  The Ethiopians have had one year under a new system, and some condemn them because of the lack of opposition candidates in theirJelections.  There are important questions to be answered. Were there clear violations? Was there consistent intimidation? Though rival army factions have decamped, is tension greater than before? The system certainly suffered from a lack of adequate civic education. The process was rushed and flawed, but compromises and changes went on, even on election eve. Progress? Yes. A long way to go? You bet. Will it work? I think the Ethiopian people will assure that it will.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a century of imperial rule and two decades of military dictatorship, it should come as no surprise that the creation of democracy in Ethiopia is encountering obstacles. But recent events have taken a decidely disconcerting turn, beginning with a troubled election on June 21 and continuing with an escalation of ethnic divisions within the ruling transitional administration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interim government, formed a year ago after the ouster of Mengistu Haile Mariam, who headed the military regime which seized power in 1974, has fought against divisiveness since its earliest days. Following last month's elections, the ruling coalition -- known as the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, whose combined guerrilla forces pushed Mengistu out of power-- suffered a serious setback. The Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), claiming to represent the country's largest ethnic group, pulled out of the government, charging fraud and mismanagement of the election process. Fighting between government troops and OLF forces reportedly erupted in the south, where the two groups clashed earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Meles Zenawi accused the OLF of attacking government positions, a charge denied by the front, which said its forces were the ones under attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In attendance during the voting for local council positions around the country was an international observer force of 200 coordinated by the United Nations and drawn from 27 countries, including the U.S., which sent a delegation of 71, assembled by the African-American Institute in New York. The following eyewitness account by delegation member and Africa News executive director Bertie Howard, provides a flavor of the process and the problems. The American delegation's assessment, in the form of a statement, is also reproduced below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young military officers who took over the government of Sierra Leone in an April coup d'etat have fired up a demoralized populace by briskly moving to restore public services and to unearth public funds missing under the former regime. But many who have official or business dealings in Freetown, the capital, are skeptical about whether the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), as the new government is called, is equal to its most critical challenge -- stopping the diamond smuggling and corruption that have cheated the nation of tax revenues and have helped consign Sierra Leone to the ranks of the world's least-developed countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone, where legal diamond exports have fallen from two million carats in 1970 to 132,000 in 1989, is not the only African nation to be bled of its mineral wealth. &quot;All the diamonds have feet,&quot; said an official at the Bureau of Mines in Washington, &quot;but in Sierra Leone the smuggling is so rampant.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, it was hard to ignore the evidence that mine operators and diamond dealers were bribing officials of the government of former President Joseph Momoh to secure mining concessions and special detours around the tax authorities. Untended, the health, electric, water and telephone systems deteriorated. Ministers drove fancy cars over crumbling roads while unpaid civil servants left their desks to do odd jobs. When there was no money in the national treasury to cover imports, consumers paid higher prices for scarce staples and fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of a series of reforms required to reinstate the country's borrowing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), President Momoh had begun to renegotiate some of the country's major mineral contracts (rutile and bauxite, as well as diamonds). The contracts were negotiated under the close guidance of international financial institutions. Even so, &quot;money needed to change hands in almost every deal,&quot; said a European consultant involved in some of the negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPRC, headed by Capt. Valentine Strasser, has repeatedly vowed to get a handle on diamond exports and has claimed that tax receipts were up 500% during NPRC's first five weeks in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the delight of Sierra Leoneans, the NPRC also has jailed about 50 former officials of the Momoh government, frozen the bank accounts of the former president and his cronies and discovered eye-popping caches of wealth in some of their homes. A judicial probe of government corruption is under way, and officials and civil servants are now required to fill out financial disclosure forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real question is, can the NPRC itself resist succumbing to corruption? Optimistic observers say it all depends on how fast the government fulfills its promise to set the country back on the path toward multiparty democracy that President Momoh was halfheartedly pursuing when he was ousted.  But a mining industry source saw an ominous sign in Strasser's decision to make his residence the opulent marble mansion built by Momoh's predecessor, Siaka Stevens, overlooking Freetown on Juba Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sooner or later, discussions of corruption turn to the Lebanese community, which dominates much of the diamond industry, and to the two Israeli companies that tried to muscle out the Lebanese during the Momoh regime. The Israelis, with their government's backing, wanted diamonds and a moderation in Sierra Leone's pro-Palestinian foreign policy, which was heavily influenced by the Lebanese. The Lebanese have engendered great resentment because of their relative wealth and the &quot;special relationships&quot; that some in the community, which dates back to the late nineteenth century, were able to maintain with Momoh and his predecessors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although several wealthy Lebanese Sierra Leoneans have been driven into exile, few believe rumors that the NPRC plans to expel the entire community. The Lebanese monopoly on Sierra Leone's retail trade is galling to the impoverished African population, but it is difficult to see who else might put up the cash to finance imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sierra Leonean official, however, guardedly suggested that the country could benefit from setting up a competition between the local Lebanese and Israeli investors. One of the NPRC's first foreign policy initiatives was to dispatch its foreign minister to Israel to renew diplomatic ties that were broken in 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ties with Israel will result in new weapons and training for Sierra Leone's army, Francis Gabbidon, Israel's lobbyist in Freetown, told Inter Press Service. Such aid might give the army the boost it needs to drive out Revolutionary United Front (RUF) guerrillas who have waged a destructive war in the south and east of the country since March 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone's fight against the RUF is intertwined with its participation in the West African peace-keeping forces that have been trying to end the Liberian civil war. A peaceful resolution of the Liberian conflict may well bring an end to the fighting in Sierra Leone, where the RUF is seen as a proxy for Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor. Anti-Taylor Liberian forces are fighting alongside the Sierra Leonean military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without such a settlement -- and without outside military aid beyond the limited support provided by Nigeria and Guinea -- there is little hope that Sierra Leone can defeat the RUF militarily. There is much riding on the outcome of the conflict. Not only is it raging over important mining areas, but the NPRC has said it will permit a return to civilian rule only when the RUF has been quelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The troops at the front now are complaining, according to the BBC, that they lack adequate food and pay, and that the veterans most needed at the front are palling around with NPRC officials. Ironically, it was to demand adequate supplies and support that Strasser and his associates traveled from the front to Freetown in April. They appeared to have been as surprised as anyone when their demonstration spiraled into a successful coup.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following are excerpts from a June 12 statement by Justice Z.R.  Chesoni, chairman of an independent electoral commission appointed by Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi to oversee the nation's first multiparty elections since the 1960s. The portions excerpted refer to allegations of wrongdoing during the voter registration process which began June 8.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has taken seriously the errors that have been pointed out by various persons and organizations, and immediate steps have been taken to arrest the situation.  In most areas, the corrective measures have included issuing of replacement cards for the faulty ones and even removal of inefficient officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has set up a team which is visiting the districts and registration centers to check on the management of the registration process, and the commissioners are also visiting various centers for the same purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission is open to receiving suggestions on how to improve and speed up the process, and we thank Kenyans who have already offered suggestions and advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any applicant for registration who experiences a problem with obtaining an identification card should seek the assistance of the supervisor at the registration center where he or she wishes to be registered.  As far as (is) practical, all qualified persons who apply shall be registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way any Kenyan can exercise his or her democratic right of electing a leader of one's choice is by obtaining a voter's card, which is the only weapon for removing undesirable leaders.  Registration of voters is an exercise limited in time.  Register before the time allowed expires.  If you delay, it may be too late.  It is better to have a voter's card and not use it than not to have one, so register now.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometime in the next nine months, the Kenyan government is expected to hold the nation's first multiparty elections since the late 1960s. President Daniel arap Moi has not yet announced a specific date for the elections, but according to the Kenyan constitution, elections must be held by next March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least five opposition parties have registered, and the two largest, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) and the Democratic Party (DP) have begun campaigning extensively in rural areas. Observers say there is a high level of popular discontent with Kanu, which has been the ruling party since 1963, and the elections, if carried through, may mark a watershed in Kenyan history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions have already risen, however, over what the opposition parties claim are attempts by Kanu to rig the electoral process in its favor. On June 8, the government began implementing the process of providing registration cards to the estimated 12 million eligible voters, under the supervision of an independent electoral commission appointed by President Moi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite some complaints that the electoral commission was not impartial, the opposition parties initially supported the registration process. But on June 10, both FORD and DP changed their position, issuing a joint statement calling on their supporters to boycott the registration process. The opposition charged that the registration had been tainted by massive irregularities and demanded that an entirely new commission be appointed to oversee the process. The registration process has continued, however, and as of June 28, the commission reported that about 3.3 million voters had registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the controversy over the registration process is not resolved, the crisis could spoil the elections, worsen tensions and possibly intensify recent violent clashes in the Rift Valley and Western Province that are widely seen as being tied to political tensions between the government and the opposition.  The conflicts have caused hundreds of deaths and forced thousands to flee their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raila Odinga, a leading FORD member, visited Washington late last month for talks with the State Department and the Congress. Odinga is the son of Oginga Odinga, former vice president under Kenyatta, a perennial dissident and one of the leading contenders to be the next president of Kenya. In the following interview with Will Acworth, Odinga talks about the boycott controversy and the campaign for multiparty democracy in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AfricaNews: Herman Cohen, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Africa, has called your boycott of the registration process ill-advised. How do you respond to this comment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raila Odinga: Cohen's statement was misinformed, it must have been based on a lack of information about the present exercise. The irregularities and the fraud are so massive that it does not permit any kind of rectification short of scrapping the electoral commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Cohen has also emphasized the need for dialogue between the opposition and the government. How do you respond?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: As for the question of dialogue, we have been asking for dialogue all along. We have wanted to sit down with the government to discuss the program and the timing of change. Two days before President Moi left for the Rio conference, we sent a joint appeal to him asking for a meeting to discuss these issues, but he did not respond. So the ball is in the government's court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: What was contained in this appeal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: First, we must have a truly independent electoral commission.  Second, the president must set a date and a timetable for the elections. Third is the question of the media, which Kanu is using as its own propaganda machinery. The Voice of Kenya is still the &quot;Voice of Kanu.&quot; Fourth, the violence must be brought to an end. We can't register if people are being killed. Fifth is the problem of identity cards. There are 3.5 million Kenyans who still lack identity cards, which are required for (voter) registration.  Sixth, the government must cease the harassment of our supporters and allow us to hold our rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: What has been the reaction of the U.S. officials here in Washington to your charges of fraud in the registration process?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: They were shocked by the information I showed them. I tried to explain to them that we would not have called off this exercise if it had not been very evident that the whole thing was flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I tried to indicate to them that the present exercise, if allowed to continue, would just amount to giving Moi a new lease on life. There is no way that we can proceed with this registration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had in fact asked the people to continue to register as we pressed for the resolution of the commission issue, but after two days it was evident that the registration was so fraudulent that it was therefore an exercise in futility. That's why we called it off. An independent electoral commission is an absolute condition of a free and fair electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: How do you propose that a new electoral commission be created?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: The current officials should be replaced with Kenyans in good standing who are not associated with the current government. We will propose some names of people (who) are approved by both the opposition and the government and then let the President choose from that list. Second, the commission must have its own funds and its own staff, so that the process is detached from the establishment. Not much time will be lost; if we move quickly, the registration process can begin in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The so-called independent commission exists just on paper. It sits in the parliament buildings, it is paid through the Office of the President, and the staff in the field are the provincial administration -- the district commissioners, the district officers, the chiefs and the sub-chiefs. And the Kanu stalwarts are being used as registration supervisors in the rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we want to see is a completely new commission, which will have funding independent of the administration, so that the whole process is detached from the government. It can then proceed to hire its own staff and carry out the registration exercise independently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, all the opposition parties must be allowed to have their own representatives at each and every registration center to monitor the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Are you saying that at this stage FORD cannot send representatives to the registration stations to monitor what is happening?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: Well, they are now saying that we can send people, but that is only after we made the boycott call. They should also allow international observers to participate and monitor the registration exercise. The government is allowing only the Commonwealth team, but we are highly suspicious. We accept that they should come, but the Ugandan experience has given them a certain stigma -- they certified that the 1980 elections were free and fair, but those elections now have been proved to have been massively rigged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: According to reports in the Kenyan press, the British, the Germans and the EC have offered to provide funding for the electoral process. What about the U.S.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: We have received confidential assurances that the U.S. is willing to provide some money for the elections. We advised the U.S. that they should provide materials, such as computers, printing of ballot papers, etc., and secondly that they should closely monitor the assistance to make sure that this money really reaches the people for whom it is intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: George Anyona, a former detainee with a long record as a fierce critic of the government, recently announced that he has decided to form his own political party. In spite of his opposition to the current government, he declared that the registration process should continue. How do you respond?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: Well, that's his own opinion. George has been a close comrade in arms. We have been in the struggle for quite some time together, but since he came out of detention, his entire conduct and utterances have left a lot to be desired. He has now more or less isolated himself, crying foul and criticizing for the sake of criticizing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: There is a lot of disagreement and confusion within FORD, and you seem to have some difficulty coming up with a unified platform for the elections. Is FORD a full-fledged political party?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: We are a full-fledged political party... with a manifesto and policy statements. FORD is a vehicle for the restoration of democracy, for the resuscitation of the institutions (needed) to ensure democratic governance.  Once the elections are over, we will have achieved our purpose, and at that point FORD may break up into different parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: FORD already seems to be breaking up. You have at least four different leaders competing to be the party's presidential candidate. Is it a sign of confusion that your leadership speaks with so many voices?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: We believe that disagreement is healthy. The fact that we have differing views within FORD should not be looked at as a split or a division.  It is an exercise in democracy, because at the end of the day, it will be the people who will decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: How, exactly, will they decide?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: Grassroots elections (within the party) will be held on July 11 and 12, followed by sub-branch elections on July 18 and branch elections on July 19. Twelve delegates from each branch will attend the national delegates conference, which will be held on August 1, to ratify the constitution, decide on the process for choosing the presidential candidate and elect the office bearers for the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Can you comment on the recent secret meeting between President Moi and Martin Shikuku, the secretary general of FORD, which caused so much controversy when it was leaked to the press?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: There would not have been much criticism of this visit if Shikuku had cared to consult with other members of FORD. But the fact that the visit was secretly done, and the fact that Shikuku himself did not announce it until the information leaked to the press, gave rise to the suspicion that there might be something sinister about this visit. The fact is he has not disclosed the content of the discussion, which lends weight to the conjecture that he may have been cutting some kind of deal with the president. The members of FORD were of course very incensed and angry, and a majority of the steering committee thought that he should be suspended. However, fortunately, goodwill prevailed, and he ended up just being stripped of some of his powers as secretary general. We realized that a suspension would just play into the hands of the enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: One of the legacies of past political parties has been an emphasis on ethnic affiliation, where each politician claims to represent a certain bloc of voters. Is it correct to interpret the splits in FORD along these lines?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: It is very simplistic to look at the Kenyan situation in terms of tribal blocs. It is not true to say that (Masinde) Muliro leads the Luhya, or Odinga leads the Luo, or (Kenneth) Matiba leads the Kikuyu. It is a very fallacious view to say that because someone comes from a certain community, he therefore enjoys the support of the whole community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are just emerging from a dictatorship, where dissent was completely muzzled, where it was very difficult for a popular leadership to emerge across ethnic lines. The question of tribal affiliation itself is not, in my view, really a predominant factor in the Kenyan mind. The Kenyans will judge their leaders by who they are and what they stand for. Commitment to principles is going to be the main criterion the people will use to decide whom they will support for leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: What about the fact that FORD has attracted so many former high- ranking members of Kanu? Is this a sign that FORD has become a vehicle for political opportunism?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: We began as a pressure group, as a coalition of people who agreed on the general goal of democracy. Then we were faced with an exodus of people (from Kanu) who wanted to cross over to us, and we decided for expedient and strategic reasons to keep an open door policy -- we thought that this would accelerate the process of Kanu's disintegration. But in the process, we gathered a lot of trash, the so-called political entrepreneurs, who have no convictions or understanding of our principles. We will let the people sort out the wheat from the chaff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: If FORD comes to power, what will happen to the leading members of Kanu?  One prominent FORD leader, Paul Muite, has said on a number of occasions that Moi himself should go on trial for his crimes. If FORD makes these kinds of threats, won't Moi try to cling to power as long as he can?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RO: We have been discussing that thing, and in Muite's last public address he said the same thing I have been saying, that we are going to provide (Moi) with some security. Moi has committed a lot of crimes. In order to prevent more bloodshed, we must give Moi a way out. The senseless killing in the Rift Valley can be avoided if Moi is given a way out. If he agrees to stop the bloodshed and presides over a smooth transition to a multiparty democracy, then he will also have made his contribution to the history of the country, and we can look kindly at his past transgressions.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blantyre, Malawi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After unprecedented urban unrest, businesses have reopened along Haile Selassie Road, a busy thoroughfare slicing through this east African industrial center. Opposition to the 28-year rule of &quot;Life President&quot; Kamuza Banda appears to have been swept away along with the shards of shattered windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a closer look reveals a pattern of political defiance that is peculiarly Malawian. Unlike other countries across Africa, where mass street protests have forced dozens of authoritarian governments to reform or leave office, Malawi has remained largely quiet. In mid-May, demonstrations over wages paralyzed business districts like Haile Selassie Road -- and left an estimated 38 people dead. The disturbances were notable partly because they are so uncommon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than taking to the streets to express their outrage at Banda's dictatorial powers, Malawians, in increasing numbers, are staying home. The trend is a reaction to the government's well-developed security system, with its network of informers, and to the dangers of opposition here, where suspicious automobile accidents and mysterious deaths have plagued dissidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although staying home may seem a subtle form of protest, it is a highly visible one in a country whose political culture is built on well-orchestrated displays of support for the government. Recent ruling party rallies in empty stadiums and welcoming ceremonies for visiting dignitaries without the usual throngs of well wishers are signs of growing discontent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My brother is in jail because they had a picture of him demonstrating against police brutality,&quot; said a young woman in Zomba, where the university has been closed following student unrest. &quot;They can't photograph me if I make my point by not showing up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another tool of dissent in Malawi is the facsimile machine. More difficult to intercept than telephone or telex transmissions, faxes have become the instrument of choice for communicating within the opposition and infiltrating government offices with anonymous messages of resistance. The effectiveness of this guerrilla information campaign was verified when the president in one recent speech condemned &quot;anonymous letters defaming certain individuals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the stay-home approach by Malawians continues, hopes that Banda might finally have to loosen the reins on political dialogue and move the country toward peaceful change have been boosted by an aid cutoff approved by donors in May.  But there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the status of some assistance programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank recently approved two additional loans for development projects in Malawi, and humanitarian assistance is specifically excluded from the donors' ban. Malawi is hosting nearly one million Mozambican refugees, the largest displaced population from a single county in any African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're doing a great job with the refugees and they know it,&quot; a Western diplomat here said. &quot;We all sympathize with the situation in Mozambique, and we all want to help them, but I wouldn't put it past this government to use them as pawns if it means more money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy Leader Readies for Showdown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Monsengwo Pasinya, the chairman of Zaire's broad-based national democracy conference, has returned home from a visit with prom ises of the support he was seeking in Washington, Brussels and Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During two days in the U.S. capital, where he met Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the cleric warned of an &quot;apolcalypse&quot; in Zaire if a solution is not found to the country's months-old political crisis. After the talks, the State Department issued a statement saying the administration supports &quot;a process leading to democracy in Zaire, not any particular personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Belgian and French governments also gave backing to the conference and pledged financial support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monsengwo was seeking backing in anticipation of a possible showdown later this month, when the conference -- a gathering of 2000 delegates representing Zaire's political, civic and religious organizations -- plans to name a new prime minister to govern until elections can be held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent statement and an interview on Zaire television, President Mobutu Sese Seko said he alone has the right to choose the prime minister. &quot;I set the rules of the operation,&quot; Mobutu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monsengwo predicts that it will be a difficult for the U.S. government to &quot;untangle itself&quot; from its long alliance with Mobutu. But he said that if the political reforms of the conference are blocked by &quot;forces inside or outside Zaire,&quot; the situation would deteriorate quickly. He says people are becoming impatient with the political stalement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Monsengwo said American pressure could be pivotal if a confrontation develops between the Zaire president and the national conference. He credits a private letter in March from President Bush with persuading Mobutu to allow the democracy conference to reconvene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archbishop, who came to the U.S. at the invitation of the Africa Faith and Justice Network, a private Catholic organization, also was received at the White House by National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, was hosted at a State Department luncheon by Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Herman Cohen and met on Capitol Hill with Senate Foreign Relations Committee members Paul Simon (D-IL), Nancy Kassebaum (R-KA) and Richard Lugar (R-IN), and the chairman of the House Africa Subcommittee, Mervyn Dymally (D-CA).  n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The images that many Americans hold about Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria are false, says Anwar Haddam, a member of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) who gained a seat in last year's parliamentary elections, which were aborted when the military-led ruling council took power in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The front is committed to allowing opposition parties, to tolerating other religions, and to guaranteeing the rights of women, he says. &quot;The FIS puts the freedom to express opinions, form political parties, and hold elections as fundamental,&quot; he says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haddam, who fled Algeria to avoid arrest, has been visiting the United States to press his party's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FIS won the largest bloc of votes in round one of the parliamentary elections and was expected to win the second round as well, before the army suspended voting. Algerians are bitter about what has happened to them over the past six months, Haddam says. &quot;People have the right to choose their own leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haddam criticizes the U.S. government for failing to condemn the January takeover and the subsequent crackdown on the FIS leadership. The seven top officials of the front are in detention, facing capital charges of insurrection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. denounced coups in other countries, the Soviet Union and Peru, for example,&quot; Haddam says. &quot;Why, if the U.S. supports democracy in those places, do they not in the case of Algeria?&quot; He also questions why the United States opposes the FIS but fails to criticize Saudi Arabia which &quot;violates Islamic law and human rights and oppresses women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he fears that &quot;a new iron curtain &quot; is being erected between the west and the Muslim world. &quot;We don't want this,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the assassination of Algerian head of state Mohamed Boudiaf, Haddam says the FIS &quot;is not directly involved in violence&quot; but does not condemn those &quot;who will try to free our people.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1027 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed Boudiaf had only a short tenure as Algerian head of state before he was gunned down on June 29, but the suspicions that arose immediately about his possible assassins indicate that he had an important impact during his six months in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first assumption by most observers was that Boudiaf was killed by Islamic fundamentalists, who appeared poised to take power before Boudiaf agreed in January to head a five-man government created by the military following a bloodless coup d'etat. But some observers also pointed suspicion at elements within the long-serving military and civilian leadership who were discomfited by Boudiaf's recent moves to investigate and crack down on high-level corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of nine leaders of Algeria's revolt against French colonial rule in the late 1950s, Boudiaf had been in exile in Morocco for 28 years when he came home on January 16 to head the High State Council, which the military said would govern until 1993. Four days earlier, the military had forced President Chadli Bendjedid to resign to prevent him from going through with a second round of elections which almost certainly would have been won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). The vote also would have produced Algeria's first multiparty parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many regarded the 72-year-old Boudiaf as a figurehead for the military, valued because his long absence had left him untainted by the charges of corruption and human rights abuses that plague his former National Liberation Front (FLN) colleagues after their three decades of single-party rule. Boudiaf had fallen out with the FLN soon after Algeria won its independence from France in 1962 after an eight-year struggle. He accused the party of abandoning its commitment to democracy and was briefly jailed under a death sentence for his dissent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military's takeover was welcomed by some Algerians -- and by a number of Western governments, including the Bush administration -- who feared that the FIS would have established a radical Islamic state and, as some of the party's leaders had suggested, would have prevented the subsequent election of a secular government. But some of the democratic parties which had lost the first round of elections to the FIS in December protested the abortion of the electoral process, saying the FIS's popularity would only be dissipated when it was shown incapable of mending Algeria's frayed economy. After the ouster of Bendjedid, the FLN -- which won only 16 parliamentary seats -- joined the democratic opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FIS vowed to overturn the coup. &quot;This regime is going to fall,&quot; FIS leader Abdelkader Hachani told his followers as the High Council took power. In June, the organization announced that its young members were going &quot;underground&quot; to wage armed struggle -- and to evade the security forces' manhunts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six months that Boudiaf led the government (also referred to as the collective presidency) were marked by constant FIS demonstrations and increasingly deadly armed exchanges between FIS militants and the military. On February 9, Boudiaf declared a state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government hunted down FIS leaders and rounded up thousands of the organization's members, sending them to detention camps in the Sahara. Only as the broiling desert heat of summer approached did the government yield to the demands of human rights organizations and begin releasing the detainees. In mid June a human rights leader appointed by Boudiaf said 4,000 detainees still remained in the camps; 3,000 had been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the political crisis persisted, there were indications that Boudiaf was playing an increasingly dominant role in the council and that a &quot;nonparty&quot; movement was coalescing around him. Boudiaf then floated the idea of a &quot;patriotic rally&quot; to draw up new ideas for governing Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, the council appointed a 60-person &quot;think tank&quot; to draft a new constitution. And in early June, Boudiaf ignored the call of secular democratic parties to form a national unity government. Instead, he appealed to Algerians to join his 'rally', where he said political parties could conduct a dialogue as a prelude to a return to democracy. He refused to specify when the council would permit elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An economic reform program, begun by President Chadli Bendjedid in 1988 -- in the wake of riots that shook the nation -- and continued by the state council government, has not yet powered the economy out of its indebtedness and stagnancy. Creating jobs for the hundreds of thousands of young Algerians who cannot find work is regarded as essential by those who favor confronting the FIS at the ballot box. Sixty-five percent of the population is under 30, and a great majority of the jobless young turned to the FIS to bring dignity and meaning to their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, Boudiaf gave his backing to a formal inquiry into alleged corruption by the FLN government. A former FLN prime minister has charged that $ 26 billion was siphoned from official funds between 1962 and 1989, and other high FLN figures, including President Bendjedid, a native of the region where Boudiaf was killed, have been accused of enriching themselves while in power.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Reed Kramer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When dozens of people were massacred in Boipatong township near Johannesburg last month, the swift re-emergence of confrontation politics in South Africa was a shock to many people outside the country who had come to accept the certainty of apartheid's collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But distrust between the white government and the opposition, led by the African National Congress (ANC), had been deepening, despite the progress made in formal negotiation sessions prior to a mid-May stalemate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of the dispute is the continuation of the violence that has claimed so many black lives. A report released this month by the Human Rights Commission, a private South African group that has been highly critical of the government, identifies 49 massacres averaging 25 deaths each that have occurred since June 1990. That tally is in addition to more than 6,000 deaths in smaller-scale violent incidents. A detailed, 100-page study by Amnesty International accuses police and security forces of &quot;complicity&quot; in the killings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent dramatic changes in South Africa, beginning with the release of Nelson Mandela and the lifting of restrictions on the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups just over two years ago, have failed to improve the lives of the overwhelmingly poor black majority. That fact, plus the anguish caused by large-scale killing, means that the ANC is having an increasingly difficult time holding onto support from its political base in the black population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a memorandum to President F.W. de Klerk following the ANC's decision to suspend negotiations after the Boipatong massacre, ANC President Nelson Mandela blamed the crisis on the &quot;direct and indirect involvement&quot; of government forces in the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC claims to have evidence of a two-pronged government strategy to undermine the opposition during the transition from white rule. One prong, code named &quot;Operation Springbok,&quot; is a complex plan to diminish political backing for the ANC, according to an article in the current issue of the official ANC journal, Mayibuye, which cites &quot;sources within government circles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article says what places the plan beyond the bounds of acceptable political maneuvering is the second prong of the strategy, dubbed &quot;Operation Thunderstorm,&quot; a carefully crafted scheme to spawn violence in black areas.  &quot;The unbanning of the ANC and the release of its leaders would then appear, in the eyes of blacks in particular, as the cause of their terrible suffering,&quot; the article says. It charges that the operations are directed by the Department of Military Intelligence, an arm of the defense force. The civilian-run National Intelligence Service is &quot;informed&quot; about the activities but is not operationally involved, Mayibuye says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world stature de Klerk attained when he freed Mandela and opened talks with the ANC has enabled the government to erode one of the ANC's chief sources of leverage -- the outside pressure that left South Africa isolated.  Most sanctions have been lifted, de Klerk has been received around the world, and South African sports teams appear headed for the Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the government is on the defensive. The ANC is pressing demands for international investigators to monitor security force actions and is calling for an end to all covert military and police activities as preconditions for resumption of the negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk responded by leaving the door open on international observers -- something the government has opposed strenuously in the past -- and by dispatching Foreign Minister Roelof Botha to Nigeria for talks with President Ibrahim Babangida and the visiting United Nations secretary general, Boutros Boutros Ghali. n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Tami Hultman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the most publicized killings here in three decades and the government's forceful response to demands that it curb political violence, South Africans are expressing a mixture of fear that the situation is beyond redemption and hope that the crisis will jolt politicians to a speedy agreement on democratic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months ago, negotiators from 19 groups, including the government and the African National Congress (ANC), appeared on the verge of approving plans for a multiracial interim government to lead the country toward free elections. But deadlock at the table and atrocities in the streets have blocked an accord and fueled anger in black communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we are in for a period of unprecedented mass action, which we hope will fall short of uncontrolled violence,&quot; says Devan Pillay, editor of Work In Progress, an independent political journal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two factors are behind the current crisis. One has been the government's insistence on what the ANC and its allies see as a minority veto on future constitutional changes -- a device government opponents say would make a mockery of universal suffrage.  The other is the steadily escalating violence in black communities.  Although the massacre of more than 50 people in the nearby settlement of Boipatong received international attention, an average of ten South Africans are killed in political conflict every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While all sides are implicated in the violence, the weight of international opinion appears to be swinging behind charges that elements within the government are primary instigators and frequent participants in the conflicts between ANC supporters and followers of the Inkatha Freedom Party led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi.  Recent reports blaming police and security forces have been issued by Amnesty International, the International Commission of Jurists, the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and the U.S. State Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among government opponents here, conviction is growing that the de Klerk government believed it could divide its enemies, and thus continue to dominate both the transitional administration and a future coalition government.  If true, that belief has proven dangerously naive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The outside world sees de Klerk and his people as clever sophisticates,&quot; says one observer of the political scene.  &quot;I went to school with some of these guys in the cabinet, and I can tell you that they just don't know what is going on. They thought they could do an end run around the ANC and stay in power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veteran journalist Allister Sparks, in a July 1 column in the Johannesburg Star, argued that the government's plan to destabilize the ANC makes no sense: &quot;What de Klerk and his colleagues have never understood, what they are too conditioned by their own past to grasp, is that the ANC is essentially a moderate organization, yet at the same time, one that is widely acceptable in the black community because of its record as the primary resistance movement and its long list of heroes and martyrs.  That placed the ANC in the unique position of being able to carry a black community embittered by half a century of apartheid into a negotiated settlement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of sensibly harnessing that capability, Sparks wrote, de Klerk &quot;has destabilized all of South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Pillay sees it, unless the next few weeks produce significant evidence of the government's willingness to move toward real democracy, South Africa is likely to face an explosion of protest.  n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brazzaville, Congo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Cindy Shiner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year after a national democracy conference in Congo eased control of the country from President Denis Sassou-Nguesso and set the stage for an end to 30 years of one-party rule, voters have discovered that multiparty government is not without difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislative elections late last month were plagued by charges of wrongdoing, raising the likelihood that long-awaited presidential elections will be postponed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The election went very badly,&quot; says Blaise Loukelo, a 31-year-old voter. &quot;There was too much cheating. In our precinct, if you wanted a ballot, they would tell you there weren't any.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pierre Fafard of Canada, one of a small number of foreign observers here for the June 24 vote, calls the legislative elections deplorable.  Presidential voting, originally set for June but currently scheduled for July 19 and August 2, &quot;could be delayed for months,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congo, with a population of 2.3 million, has about 1.3 million registered voters. Some 1,800 candidates are vying for 125 seats on the National Assembly, but final selection of assembly members is awaiting a second, run-off round which also has been delayed. Interior Minister Alphonse Nzoungou says that because of alleged irregularities, such as a lack of ballots and other voting materials, about 25 of the 800 polling stations here in the capital would have to repeat first-round voting. Some results in other places, such as Pointe Noire, the country's second largest city, were also annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roman Catholic Archbishop Ernest Kombo, the head of Congo's transitional legislature, said there was no explanation for the missing ballots that were reported at some polling stations.  He promises an investigation and urged Congolese to remain peaceful &quot;so that we have the time to work calmly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Prime Minister Andre Milongo publicly acknowledged fraud in May's municipal elections, and six mayors and nine regional prefects subsequently were fired. The country's transitional legislature called on Milongo's government to resign. Instead, the prime minister reshuffled his government and pared it from 18 to ten members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fafard says it was premature to have the elections. &quot;They lacked organization and planning.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chibabava, Mozambique</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Ruth Aneah Ayisi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Squatting in front of their wattle and daub huts, women mechanically sort out &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; strands of grass. Then they put the good strands into pots of water boiling on log fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women and their children, many with swollen stomachs and spindly legs, seem to have no real interest in what is to be their only meal for the day.  The community's few remaining men are old and despondent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have had no food to eat for two weeks,&quot; says Chilente Simango, a grandfather of seven, who is now living in a government-controlled accommodation center in Chibabava, in the central province of Sofala.  &quot;We're having to eat like wild animals in the bush.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drought that has burned crops in many countries throughout southern Africa has struck a stinging blow to Mozambique, where a war between the government and the rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) has driven tens of thousands of peasants off their land.  Even before the drought, half of the country's 16 million people were dependent on foreign food aid for their survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For an old man like Simango, the drought may have destroyed hope of survival.  His long life has seen too many tragedies. His frail body matches his frail spirits as he speaks of his loneliness: &quot;The war has separated me from my family. I do not know where any of them are or who is alive or dead.  The rebels did not take me, because I am too old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the sense of hopelessness in this community, a nurse is busily treating the severely malnourished children.  &quot;We still have milk, oil and sugar for them,&quot; she says. &quot;I think they will recover if more food aid is sent soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donor agencies have responded positively to past emergency appeals from the government, but the task of delivering the food to the needy is another hurdle to overcome.  Food aid sometimes arrives late or is stolen by hungry soldiers.  The government says it is cracking down on such abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war is also causing many needy communities to become increasingly difficult and costly to reach. Chibabava, for example, is only accessible by air.  Rugged brush land controlled by Renamo surrounds the lonely district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the southern province of Gaza, a recently burned-out convoy which was carrying maize for a hungry community is a silent symbol of the cruel reality of war. Government soldiers say the convoy hit one of the many land mines hidden in the sandy road.  Reaching the burned trucks involved walking single file behind young troops who tested the way ahead.  The villagers, however, never have this protection, as evidenced by the high number of people with missing limbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambique is a country with the potential to feed all its people, but according to many estimates, it is the poorest nation in the world.  The conflict has cost the lives of a million people and has forced another million to flee to neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drought has already caused thousands to die of hunger and thirst, and estimates predict that at least one million people will become dependent on food aid. In the interior of the southern province of Inhambane, women must walk for a whole day just to get to the few gallons of water they need for their families.  Then they must sleep overnight and walk for another day to bring the water home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drought also has caused an increase in salt levels in existing sources of fresh water.  Greg Keast, a water and sanitation project officer for the United Nations Children's Fund, visited districts in Inhambane where some families are forced to drink salty water.  &quot;I drank some of it myself,&quot; says Keast.  &quot;It's almost like drinking sea water.  It's too salty for any kind of irrigation.  There's no plant that can take that sort of water.  In fact, it's too salty in most cases for cooking.  It can only be used for drinking.  And drinking salty water means not quenching your thirst.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Chimundzi, another village in Inhambane, 13 children died of starvation or hunger-related diseases, according to a report in June by Mozambique's national news agency AIM.  The village chairman, Andre Mazive, told AIM that unless urgent measures are taken, many more of Chimundzi's 3,500 residents will die.  Like the Chibabava residents, some of the children who died were forced to eat things they would not usually dream of consuming.  &quot;They had to eat something to deceive their stomachs,&quot; says Mazive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has become obvious is the ability of Mozambicans to battle on to the end -- even if it means eating grass.  Health workers in many isolated districts work tirelessly to save the lives of children.  And they carry their work out at a risk.  Viewed as collaborators with the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front, some health workers have been massacred and others kidnapped by the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peasant farmers have also learned to live with the threat of attacks and adapt their lives.  Elisa Nhangane, an elderly widow living in Marrecuene, a rural district in the southern province of Maputo, is determined to push ahead.  In previous years, Nhangane enjoyed bumper harvests, but this year the drought has destroyed most of her crops.  The sweet potatoes and cassava survived but were stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Chibabava, Nhangane's community is not cut off.  Only 28 miles (45 kilometers) from Mozambique's capital, Maputo, residents there can still carve out a living -- even against tremendous odds.  &quot;I'm still managing to keep alive after all these years,&quot; says Nhangane.  &quot;But this year the security situation is the worst.  I hear people saying that someone was killed there or another kidnapped.  I became frightened, so now I sleep in the bush at night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war has intensified in many areas of this vast and sparsely populated country, despite the fact that President Joaquim Chissano's government is planning for peace -- the only real solution for Mozambique.  But an end to the conflict will begin another emergency situation -- that of rebuilding the nation and providing food assistance to peasant farmers returning to their lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenges of lasting peace are great. A new nonpartisan army will have to be formed, and many disillusioned soldiers demobilized.  They will need jobs or some kind of compensation.  Renamo's army, many of whom are just children under the age of 16 and accustomed to violence as a way of life, will be particularly difficult to integrate into society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the social fabric of society has been ripped apart, as families like Simango's have splintered. The urban crime rate in recent years has soared as arms circulate out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopes for peace have been dashed repeatedly in the past two years, since direct negotiations began in Rome between the Mozambican government and Renamo rebels.  Much of the blame has been put at the feet of Renamo, an organization with a reputation among many for mutilations and grisly massacres. And analysts say that Renamo's leader, Alfonso Dhlakama, is having difficulty in transforming his movement from a military one to a political one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hope for peace is what gives most people like Nhangane the will to battle on.  &quot;I have been following the peace talks on the radio,&quot; she says.  &quot;I feel confident that peace will come here.  I know some day the drought and the war will end.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A truce has been agreed in Rwanda between the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and government troops, following successful peace talks in Arusha, Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A full cease-fire will take effect July 31 and will be monitored by military observers from Nigeria, Senegal and Zimbabwe under the supervision of a rebel/government commission, according to a communique issued at the conclusion of four days of talks earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides agreeing to stop fighting, the two sides also decided that the Rwandan army will absorb RPF fighters, and they jointly called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country. The rebels have charged the government received help in the civil war from 300 soldiers France sent to Rwanda ostensibly to protect its citizens there. The government has charged the rebels received help from Uganda, from which the RPF invaded in October 1990 with a force mostly drawn from deserters from that country's army.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A March 29 cease-fire was broken within days, but diplomats at the talks said the government has several compelling reasons to make the current agreement work: the cost of an army that has quadrupled in size since the rebels invaded; the dislocation of 250,000 people and the disruption of food transport routes in the north due to fighting; and pressure from Uganda, the Organization of African Unity, former colonial ruler Belgium, France and the United States, all of which sent observers to the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government and rebels are scheduled to meet August 10 to develop a comprehensive peace plan by October 10. That plan would include a role for the RPF in the government and an agreement on the demand of the Tutsi-dominated RPF that about 500,000 members of that ethnic group be allowed to return home from exile in Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutsis, who make up about 15 percent of Rwanda's population, ruled the country until an uprising by the majority Hutus in the late 50s. Many Tutsis left Rwanda after about 100,000 were massacred in the early 1960s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are expectations that government concessions may avert further bloodshed in the wake of the June 29 assassination of President Mohammed Boudiaf and FIS attacks that have killed more than 100 police and soldiers since the party was banned in March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An FIS statement circulated before the sentencing of Front President Abassi Madani and Deputy Ali Belhadj warned the court that it would be held responsible for its judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the government made several conciliatory moves. Madani and Belhadj had originally faced death if convicted of being behind June 1991 riots in which at least 55 people died. Though the courts have sentenced 26 Islamic militants to death since May, the prosecutor sought in the Madani and Belhadj case only life sentences, and the terms the two received were much lighter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five other FIS members, convicted of undermining the economy during a strike that preceded the riot, received relatively short sentences of four to six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the court did not budge in its decision to bar foreign journalists, human rights observers and lawyers from attending the trial, held before a military tribunal. The defendants and their attorneys boycotted the trial because of the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FIS had warned in circulars that if the seven were tried at all their supporters would take up arms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the second time in two months, Comoros President Said Mohamed Djohar has dismissed the government of the three-island nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first dimissal came in May, after allegations that government members, including presidential son-in-law, Mohamed Said Abdallah -- minister of the economy, finance, trade, planning and the budget -- were involved in a financial scandal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the reinstatement of Abdallah and other ministers, this month Djohar again dismissed them, accusing Prime Minister Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim of appointing a former mercenary, Patrick Klein, as special advisor on foreign relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein was one of a group of French mercenaries who brought former President Ahmed Abdallah to power in a 1978 coup and then orchestrated his assassination in 1989. After Abdallah's death, Djohar, then president of the Supreme Court, took over as acting head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djohar was elected president in 1990, in the first elections since the Indian Ocean islands gained independence from France in 1975. Taki, Djohar's main opponent, charged that the vote was rigged. Since his election, Djohar has clung to power through a bloodless coup attempt and defections among his own supporters. He appointed Taki prime minister in January, when he formed a government of national unity in preparation for new elections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pro-democracy activist Chakufwa Chihana's release earlier this month in Malawi led some to believe &quot;President for Life&quot; Kamuzu Banda was bending to Western pressure to improve his human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But three days after Chihana was finally charged with sedition and freed on $ 2,400 bail, he was back in police custody after reporting, as required, to a police station in the capital city of Lilongwe. Chihana was told security officers had orders to take him to Zomba, a city 190 miles (300 km) south.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a July 15 Reuters news agency report, he has not been seen since, and a police officer in Zomba said there has been no sign of Chihana. Reuters also reports that large crowds gathered outside the magistrate's court in Zomba, where Chihana was charged on July 13, but the report does not say if Chihana was actually seen. &quot;We don't know where he is,&quot; a Malawi attorney told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been much distortion of the facts concerning Chakufwa Chihana's case by the dissidents outside the country,&quot; Banda said in an Independence Day speech broadcast on Malawi Radio July 5, six days before the activist's release and re-arrest. &quot;His case is not one of detention without trial at all. He will be appropriately tried and charged in an open court soon. I have given instructions that all subsequent detainees should be charged and tried in an open court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many had interpreted Banda's words as a response to a donors suspension in mid May of $ 74 million in new non-humanitarian aid, pending a change in the way Malawi approached basic freedoms and human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chihana, chairman of the recently formed Interim Committee for a Democratic Alliance, was the first political detainee to be released on bail under Banda, who has ruled Malawi since independence in 1964. On the same day, the government released ten other political prisoners, including a former Cabinet minister and secretary-general of the ruling Malawi Congress Party held for ten years without trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chihana faces five years in prison if he is convicted of importing seditious publications and preparing an act with seditious intent, his lawyer says. The activist was originally arrested April 6 as he stepped off the plane at the Lilongwe airport. Police took him away as he tried to deliver a speech calling for a mutliparty system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chihana's detention has drawn Malawians into the streets. When police failed to produce him for a hearing in mid May, thousands chanted his name outside a Lilongwe courtroom.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The southern-based OLF withdrew its ministers from the EPRDF-led government and boycotted June 21 regional elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 15,000 OLF fighters have left camps they entered under a peace agreement in the spring, and OLF attacks on traffic along roads in the south have intensified. Four people, including a police chief, were killed when the OLF ambushed a bus in the southwest town of Bale earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diplomats are trying to persuade OLF Secretary-General Galaso Dilbo, who says his organization has started a guerrilla war, to go to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, for negotiations with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headed by President Meles Zenawi, the governing coalition was formed after the EPRDF overthrew President Mengistu Haile Mariam in May 1991. The OLF, which represents Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, was given positions in the government. But the OLF says it wants greater representation for the Oromos, who make up about a third of the country's population. It also accuses the EPRDF of harassing, detaining and assassinating its members.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudanese radio announced July 14 that government forces had captured the SPLA stronghold, the southern town of Torit, and called on Popular Defense Forces (PDF) reservists and recruits to assemble for transport to the war zone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Torit has now joined the liberated areas of the homeland with the national banners flying high,&quot; Al-Bashir said during the broadcast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels say they do not need to hold towns in order to continue fighting, and an SPLA spokesman describes the loss of Torit, the last major town held by the main faction of the rebels, as a &quot;tactical withdrawal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Garang, the leader of the SPLA's main faction, has reportedly moved his headquarters to Kajo-Kaji, across the Nile from Torit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The southern-based SPLA wants self-determination for the region, inhabited mainly by Christians and animists. The government, based in the mostly Muslim Arabic-speaking north, has offered the south autonomy within a federal system and exemption from Sharia, or Islamic law, for non-Muslim areas. This stops short of the SPLA demand for a referendum on whether the region will remain part of Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo has been meeting since June with opposition leaders in response to a wave of violence against government opponents that has forced postponement of multiparty elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the violence continues, and some are placing blame on Eyadema's main backer, the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 10, a grenade explosion in the capital of Lome destroyed a platform for a memorial service to honor one of four men killed during a May 5 attack which wounded opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio. No one was injured, since the explosion took place before people assembled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses say they saw soldiers in a black Mercedes without license plates near the former parliament building where the platform was erected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Eyadema went on state television to condemn the grenade attack and other acts of violence. He said unexploded grenades left at the scene were of a type made in Russia and not used by the Togolese army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report released this month by the Paris-based International Federation of Human Rights says the army is implicated in the May 5 assassination attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attackers used army weapons and vehicles and were led by an officer of a paratroop regiment based nearby, the report says. Eyadema's son, army Capt. Ernest Eyadema, was in the area just before the ambush, according to the report. The younger Eyadema denies that the military carried out the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, who has ruled the country for 21 years, was stripped of much of his authority a year ago, when a national conference appointed reformer Joseph Kokou Koffigoh as prime minister to lead a transition to democracy. But Eyadema continues to wield power, largely because of his influence over the army, which in December shelled Koffigoh's residence and seized the prime minister, releasing him only after he appointed three Eyadema supporters to his cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koffigoh said this month that he will not run for president because he wants to shift attention away from himself and toward the country's political transition. Presidential elections, once scheduled for August, are now tentatively scheduled for late this year or early 1993.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1000 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have received the response of Mr. F.W. De Klerk to a memorandum which I addressed to him on the 26th June, 1992. I enclosed the statement of the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee of the ANC adopted on the 23rd June, 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my memorandum and the statement of the ANC we pointed out that South Africa is on the brink of disaster for which we hold the NP (National Party) government entirely responsible. Specific and concrete demands were made to Mr. F.W. de Klerk as a means of finding a way out of the impasse. These demands related to two crucial aspects:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firstly, the deadlock in the negotiating process because of the refusal by the NP government to move together with all of us in the process of truly democratizing South Africa. Our fundamental position in this regard is that we cannot accept an undemocratic constitution aimed at addressing the fears of a minority party about its own future at the cost of democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is at the root of the negotiations deadlock. It is for this reason that we focussed attention on the Constituent Assembly. We are clear in our demands that the NP government abandon positions directed at subverting the sovereignty of the Constituent Assembly, which include subjecting it to a veto by a second house and ensuring that a minority in the Constituent Assembly shall be able to frustrate an overwhelming majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, with regards to the violence in our country, our demands centered on three aspects:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ensuring that the direct and indirect involvement of the NP government, it's surrogates, the security forces and police are brought to an end forthwith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ensuring that the de Klerk government immediately implement agreements reached with the ANC more than a year ago on curbing violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The establishment of an international commission of inquiry into the Boipatong massacre and all acts of violence as well as the international monitoring of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In communicating with Mr. F.W. de klerk, we made it crystal clear that &quot;(his) response and practical steps ... to these demands will play a crucial role in determining the direction and speed with which bona fide negotiations can take place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has chosen to ignore the gravity of these demands. He seeks to channel them into endless negotiations and discussions. In particular, the content of his reply seeks to elevate government to a legitimate and credible force standing above the crisis. This is part of the deliberate attempts to perpetuate the notion of &quot;black on black&quot; violence rather than draw attention to the central role of the de Klerk government and its security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tries to enhance this position by calling for a meeting between Dr.  Buthelezi and myself at which Mr. F.W. de Klerk and his government will participate &quot;in view of it's (i.e. the de Klerk government's) responsibility for the maintenance of law and order.&quot; He persists in shielding his regime behind the back of the government-supported IFP (Inkatha Freedom Party).  Government covert and open support for the IFP has been confirmed in numerous instances. These include the Second Interim Report of the Goldstone Commission, the International Commission of Jurists fact finding mission and the Amnesty International report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk's memorandum, and his state of the nation address on 2 July, 1992, are characterized by a threatening mode and a propensity toward repression. He assumes the legitimacy of the existing order and his government.  He appears also to believe that the military power that his government commands can be a means of resolving the conflict. This was demonstrated when Mr. de Klerk attempted to visit Boipatong, where the people in the township demonstrated their anger and revulsion. Shaken by this overwhelming rejection, at a press conference held immediately thereafter, he threatened to return the country to the old style repression of the P.W. Botha regime by raising the possibility of the re-imposition of the state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have sought to ensure that the de Klerk regime responds to our demands positively and undertakes practical steps. We have done so with the clear knowledge that the longer it takes to find a way out of the current impasse the more difficult it will be to reach agreement and the more difficult it will be to ensure peace and stability in the future. If he shared this commitment, there is nothing in our demands that he could have not addressed practically and immediately. His response has failed to address the crucial issues. It is riddled with factual inaccuracies, distortions and blatant party political propaganda. It confirms the fundamental feature of our society that he and his government want to be both player and referee. By responding in the manner he has done, Mr. F.W. de Klerk has chosen to drive South Africa into a collision course. I accordingly see no reason to mislead the public and the international community about the gravity of the crisis facing our country. No good purpose will be served in my meeting him at this stage.-30-</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annexures A-F contain observations relevant to issues raised in your memorandum and elaborations on issues dealt with in this letter.  There are however a number of fundamental issues which need to be addressed urgently at a meeting between us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to the ANC's accusations, the government has not, and will not plan, conduct , orchestrate or sponsor violence in any form whatsoever against any political organization or community.  The lie that the government is sponsoring and promoting violence remains a lie no matter how often it is repeated.  Where elements in state structures err in this regard, the government will not hesitate to take appropriate measures.  There are prosecutions and convictions on record to prove this.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second interim report of the Goldstone Commission showed that the causes of violence are numerous and complicated.  The fact remains that most political violence occurs between supporters of the ANC (African National Congress) and the IFP (Inkatha Freedom Party).  This question must therefore be urgently addressed by leaders of the ANC and the IFP, and by the government, in view of its responsibility for the maintenance of order.  I therefore propose that you, Dr. Buthelezi and I meet as soon as possible for this purpose.  The agenda for this meeting could be to consider:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* an active full-time monitoring mechanism on the adequacy, efficacy and performance of all the instruments and processes already in place to combat violence and intimidation; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the advisability of a joint monitoring body through which the three parties could act to defuse and solve problems that could give rise to violence.  The role of the international community in an observer capacity could be considered, especially in relation to this item.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's Mass Mobilization</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African government acknowledges the right of peaceful demonstration and protest as important civil liberties.  However, the ANC alliance's campaign of mass mobilization, owing to its nature and aims, poses serious threats to the stability and safety of the whole of South African society, particularly in the current volatile climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the use of this kind of mass mobilization to make and impose demands in the negotiation process is just as unacceptable as the use of violence for this purpose.  Our information indicates that the SACP (South African Communist Party) and Cosatu (Congress of South African Trade Unions) have played a dominant role in redirecting the ANC from negotiations to the politics of demands and confrontation which are inherent in mass mobilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurrectionist thinking is currently flourishing within the ANC and is being propagated by a cabal with close links to the SACP and Cosatu.  These elements undermine the attempts of many ANC realists to negotiate in good faith and also induce within the ANC the spirit of radicalism and militancy of the insurrectionist school, which was evident at the SACP's eighth congress in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC/SACP have been trying to create the impression that they and the South African government are the only adversaries.  This is patently misleading and wrong since there are numerous players on the South African political scene, each with its own identity but opposed to ANC/SACP policies and methods.  The ANC's rhetoric has been radicalized and is now virtually indistinguishable from that of the SACP, and so are the ultimatum and polarization politics now being conducted.  In recent days this rhetoric has degenerated into incitement to violence and hatred at (the) grass-roots level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current mobilization action can unleash forces which the instigators will not be able to control.  This will, in turn, make extended government action unavoidable.  The program of mass mobilization, in the prevailing circumstances, will inevitably:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* lead to further violence;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* delay the search for democratic solutions;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* damage the economy, on which all South Africans depend; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* seriously disrupt social services to the detriment of those in need of medical care, protection, support and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC'S Aborting of the Negotiation Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You say that you have withdrawn from the negotiating process because of the government's involvement in violence and its lack of commitment to genuine democracy in the negotiating process.  Your allegations about government involvement in violence have already been dealt with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to your allegations concerning the government's commitment to genuine democracy, I should like to refer you to the substantial agreements already reached in the working groups of Codesa (Congress for a Democratic South Africa).  The fundamental difference between the approach of the ANC and that of the government regarding the purpose of negotiations lies, on the one hand, in our commitment to constitutionality and a transitional government as soon as possible; and on the other hand, in the ANC's insistence on an unstructured and immediate transfer of power before a proper transitional constitution is negotiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after Codesa 2, our approach to transitional arrangements was again explained to ANC representatives.  Our proposals are in line with universally accepted democratic principles.  A summary of our approach can be found in Annexure &quot;F,&quot; and in Annexure &quot;B&quot; allegations that the government is clinging to power are conclusively refuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, the remaining differences between the ANC, the government and the other political parties on key constitutional questions make multiparty negotiations more -- and not less -- imperative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC &quot;Demands&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our view what you are presenting as demands are issues that are being tailored by the ANC to support its program of mass mobilization and to justify the abortion of the negotiation process.  All these issues could have been suitably discussed at the negotiation table, and it is imperative that such discussions do take place to remove any misconceptions and misunderstanding. It should be recorded that some of these have already been dealt with by governmental measures.  Annexure &quot;E&quot; contains observations in this respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However we would like to comment in particular on the hostels and dangerous weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems relating to the hostels have been the focus of much concern and attention, but as you are aware, it is an extremely complex situation and although extensive deliberations and consultations have already taken place, much work remains to be done. This is therefore an issue that we would like to be given particular attention at our proposed meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As regards dangerous weapons, weaponry and explosives, measures have been taken and adopted regarding the carrying and possession thereof.  These measures will be strictly enforced.  Further regulations about the possession and carrying of dangerous weapons are currently under consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carrying and possession of dangerous weapons should receive attention when we meet, but particular attention must be given to the implementation of measures relating to the illegal possession of firearms and explosives and the introduction of such weapons into the country.  The AK47 has become the symbol of political and criminal violence, and firearms are the weapons mainly used to kill political opponents and to perpetrate criminal violence.  Ways and means must be found to ensure that this problem is resolved, and we must discuss this issue when the leaders of the government, the ANC and the IFP meet.  Until now this question has been dealt with bilaterally, but it has become such an integral part of the problem of violence that it can no longer remain solely on a bilateral agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I reiterate the government's commitment to peaceful negotiations as the only way to bring us to a new democratic constitution as soon as possible.  I repeat my proposal that we should met urgently for fundamental discussions, especially on the above mentioned four issues.-30-</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After trading accusations in a mid-June United Nations Security Council debate, the South African government and Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) have resumed their face-off at home, leaving negotiations over the country's future hanging in the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela won agreement for a UN role monitoring the increasingly deadly violence, and he has received other concessions from President F.W. de Klerk, including a pledge to disband three controversial security units that have been accused of instigating anti-ANC attacks. De Klerk also repeated an earlier promise to increase security at migrant workers' hostels in black townships, which have been a major locus of confrontation between pro-ANC township residents and hostel dwellers loyal to Mangosothu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC rejected de Klerk's offers as meaningless. Mandela says the controversial troops, for example, will simply be incorporated into other sections of the police or army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspension in negotiations which followed last month's massacre of more than 40 people in the Boipatong township prompted a new exchange of public statements between de Klerk and Mandela. De Klerk's July 2 memorandum contained a gesture apparently designed to persuade the ANC to resume talking, although it was contained near the end of 31 pages of a lengthy and bitter attack on the ANC's approach, in the last of six appendices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president offered to reduce from 75% to 70% the majority needed to approve constitutional change. When negotiations bogged down in mid May over this provision, the ANC offered 70% as a last-ditch compromise between what it regarded as the government's excessively high demand, giving whites a veto over future change, and the two-thirds that many constitutions around the world require. But after the ANC offer was rejected, a special ANC congress reaffirmed 66% as the formal negotiating stance, and Mandela lost his maneuvering room on this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the confrontation continues, some observers fear that other opportunities for agreement are being forfeited. But both sides remain committed to negotiations in principal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not Ready for Prime Time? You'll notice that Africa is generally missing when world affairs and trends are discussed publicly. For example, Jeane Kirkpatrick's syndicated column in the July 13 Washington Post. She wrote: &quot;Democracies have multiplied so rapidly in Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe and into Asia that it is tempting to see this as an inevitable historical development.&quot; And when was the last time you heard a presidential candidate -- or president -- asked about Africa? Or heard any of the talk show pundits muse about an African issue? But Africa's democracy movement finally made prime time this month with Jesse Jackson's address to the Democratic National Convention. Jackson mentioned the democratic tide sweeping Africa as a sign of hope that must be sustained.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is change in the air (waves)?  National Public Radio has scheduled a series of reports on Africa's problems and possibilities in an era of democracy. Scheduled to air the week of July 27, the series will include reports by Africa News Service. The project is the brainchild of Foreign Editor Codi Simon and &quot;All Things Considered&quot; Executive Producer Ellen Weiss. During that same week, NBC crews from &quot;Today&quot; will be fanning across the continent to do preliminary work for six days of live broadcasts from Africa that will air in November. Show co-host Bryant Gumbel will anchor the series from Harare, Zimbabwe. Stay tuned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Kids on the Block.  The New York Times and the Washington Post have appointed new correspondents to South Africa at a time of unprecedented political ferment there. Bill Kellor of the Times and Paul Taylor of the Post are regarded as rising stars at their respective papers.  They replace Christopher Wrenn who is going to the Times Moscow bureau, and David Ottaway, who served four tours in Africa and will be posted to Vienna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assignments Changed. Bernadette Paola has been promoted to the post of staff director at the House Subcommittee on Africa by Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-CA), the chairman. Dymally's plan to name Walter Carrington was thwarted by a hiring freeze. Adonis Hoffman, the former director, remains a consultant to the subcommittee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African American Institute President Vivian Lowery Derryck has announced the selection of Steve McDonald as executive vice president, the number two position at the New York-based organization. McDonald has been administrator of the Aspen Institute's Southern African Policy Forum. McDonald previously headed the United States-South Africa Leader Exchange Program and served as a U.S. foreign service officer in Uganda and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prize Winners. This year's recipients of African Prize for Leadership for the Sustainable End to Hunger are Graca Machel, president of the National Organization of Children of Mozambique, and Ebrahim Samba, a Gambian doctor directing a region-wide effort to eradicate river blindness. Machel, a former minister of education, is also the widow of Mozambique's first president, Samora Machel. Samba heads the Onchocerciasis Control Program. The winners share a $ 100,000 award.-30-</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LETTERS</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">654 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the May 25, 1992 issue of AfricaNews, you published some results of the International Human Suffering Index , a study by the Population Crisis Committee. While the study is interesting and perhaps even important, one must be very careful when interpreting its results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since countries differ a great deal in their features, most cross-sectional studies that involve many countries are misleading. They are done mainly because they lend themselves to expediency and are marketable -- and because we live in an era of fascination with data, scores and rankings.  (The fascination with ranking peaks every Olympic year!)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the study at hand may indeed suggest something -- levels of economic development , for example -- it is inaccurate to cast it under the label International Human Suffering Index.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, what constitutes suffering? It is inappropriate to use the same criteria for all countries. In some societies, suffering would be measured in terms of, among other indicators, the divorce rate, suicide rate, drug use, abortion rate, the number of people you know in the immediate community (i.e., a loneliness factor -- the fewer the people, the higher the suffering index), the number of children per family (the lower the number, the higher the suffering index!), etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second problem, related to the first, is how one arrives at the measures for various criteria. Life expectancy, for example, presumably is used to measure the fullness of life. Yet someone in Africa or Asia may be considered to have lived a full life by the members of his or her society if he or she lived long enough to see grandchildren and great grandchildren. This may be accomplished in 60 years or even less in these societies. Of course, it may be that the factors that cause someone to live for only 60 years instead of 76 do give rise to suffering; I do not denigrate the importance of working to improve life expectancy. My point is that it is misleading to use such statistics as a measure of human suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, even if we agree on the criteria and they were applicable to all countries, it would be wrong to give them equal weight in different countries. For example, an inflation rate of 10% in a country whose economy is fully monetarized (i.e., where almost all goods and services enter commercial channels), is not the same as inflation at the same rate in a country where a substantial part of output does not enter commercial channels.  Likewise, two countries with the same per capita GNP may have very different income distribution patterns. Another example: communications technology in one society may be a necessity, while it may be merely a luxury or even useless in another (where its absence certainly does not give rise to the &quot;suffering&quot; another society may experience in its absence).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, even if the study were for a single country, it would be wrong to give each criterion the same weight. In a measure of suffering, how can communications technology -- in any country -- be given the same weight as the availability of food?  Richard E. Mshomba Assistant Professor of Economics La Salle University</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1134 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hazel M. McFerson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an American who has lived, worked and traveled throughout Africa, particularly in the Horn, I am dismayed by the double standard evident in the contrasting responses of the world community to the tragedies of Somalia and Sarajevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News that the United States has dispatched six warships to the Adriatic Sea in response to the conflict in Yugoslavia underscores the differences. There is a disturbing lack of urgency in the world's response to the Somalia crisis. While the West musters military force to deliver humanitarian assistance to the 400,000 residents of Sarajevo, millions of Somalis are ignored.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian nationalists opposed to Bosnia's secession from Yugoslavia have bombarded Bosnia and Herzegovina with heavy artillery for 12 weeks. But in Somalia, competing forces in Mogadishu have subjected civilians to severe heavy artillery and aerial shelling for over seven months. This follows years of famine and a long civil war against the country's former dictator, Mohamed Siad Barre, who was ousted in January 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 50,000 Somalis have been killed or gravely injured since last December. Hundreds of children are dying every week. Reports say that 4.5 million Somalis are at risk from hunger and disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somalis are fleeing their country every day, and many arrive at refugee camps in Kenya with wounds that have gone untended. Recently, a mercy boat arrived at one camp carrying 280 starving Somalis, mostly women and children. One woman had severe burns caused by a bomb. Another woman was bleeding from a miscarriage caused by soldiers in Somalia who beat, kicked and robbed her. Somalis in the poorly administered refugee camps are dying of respiratory infections, malnutrition and diarrhea. An inadequate water supply is also a major problem in the semi-desert areas where the camps are located.  Other Somalis, sick and near death, are descending in boats upon neighboring Yemen, which does not have the resources to care for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community has been slow to respond to Somalia's humanitarian needs, even though Somali factions signed their eleventh cease-fire agreement on March 3. As early as last December, UN relief organizations were mired in controversy about war and humanitarianism in Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali expressed interest in UN mediation of the conflict, but became preoccupied with equally pressing issues elsewhere. The Organization of African Unity condemned the fighting, although it took Secretary-General Salim Salim more than a month to offer to mediate. UN Undersecretary-General James O.C. Jonah made a hasty visit to Mogadishu from the safety of Nairobi, where the majority of relief organizations also waited for the conflict to cool down. The UN evacuated its foreign staff from Mogadishu in January, and until very recently, prevented staff from going back because the city is considered to be too dangerous. Food and medicines did not reach Somalia for close to six months. The delegate general for Africa of the International Committee of the Red Cross asked: &quot;How come Unicef/Somalia has 13 people in Nairobi and no one inside Somalia?&quot; The deputy director of the UN Development Program for Somalia, Mario Borsotti, replied that &quot;in a situation of war, we don't operate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States, a major ally of Somalia during the Cold War, has also declined to press for humanitarian intervention. AfricaNews, the New York Times and the Washington Post reported that the Bush administration derailed a UN Security Council's effort to send a 500-member peacekeeping force to Somalia to protect UN, Red Cross and other workers trying to deliver food and supplies to the suffering Somalis. John R. Bolton, U.S. assistant secretary of State, responded to the reports by saying that &quot;the problem is that the key Somali parties have not agreed to the specifics of the guard force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But recent headlines illustrate a different urgency in the West's attitudes toward humanitarianism and war in Sarajevo. Consider, for example, the ultimatum delivered by the UN Security Council reported recently in a banner headline in the New York Times: &quot;Serbs Told to End Siege of Sarajevo or Risk UN Force.&quot; The combatants were warned that if they did not comply, the Security Council would &quot;determine what ... means would be required&quot; to deliver humanitarian relief. The Bush administration repeatedly has expressed indignation over the suffering in Sarajevo and has indicated a possible willingness to commit air and naval combat forces to escort relief convoys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the blockade of Sarajevo was lifted, President Bush had initiated urgent and intensive consultations with allies about forming an international military coalition to break the blockade. Included within this coalition were nations which have been slow responding to humanitarian needs in Somalia: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. French President Francois Mitterand felt so compelled to act that he undertook a personal mission to Sarajevo, even though UN military commanders warned that the mission was extremely dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One cannot help but wonder if the differing responses to war and humanitarianism in Somalia and Sarajevo are rooted in differences of pigmentation. Whether intended or not, the message is that European lives are more important than African lives, and responses to war and humanitarianism seem guided by this reality.-30-</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the worst drought of the century threatens the lives of more than 3 million of Mozambique's 15 million people, peace talks aimed at ending 12 years of brutal civil war drag on without agreement, blocking deliveries of food and medical supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem lies with the rebel movement known as the Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo), which continues to create excuses for delaying the discussions and refuses to sign a cease-fire accord.  Established as a destabilization tool by the Rhodesian white regime in the 1970s, Renamo is known for widespread atrocities, seemingly pointless attacks on civilians, and the forced recruitment of child soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sparked by war and drought, famine is spreading to large sections of the country. Experts say that unless food aid is able to reach the worst drought-stricken areas within the next few months, the scale of human suffering and death will exceed that of the Ethiopian famine of 1984, which stirred worldwide reaction.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Renamo continues to rebuff calls for a nationwide truce or for &quot;corridors of peace&quot; to allow food to reach those in need. When peace talks, which began in Rome two years ago, entered their eleventh round last month, Renamo startled negotiators by demanding renegotiation of issues previously agreed upon by both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano has made nearly every concession demanded by Renamo. During a visit to the United States earlier this month, he told me he was even willing to meet face-to-face with the Renamo leader, Afonso Dhlakama, if this would bring peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano looks like a man who is suffering with his people. He speaks in poignant terms of the impact the drought is having and the effects of war, which Mozambicans have experienced almost non-stop since the early 1960s when the Mozambique Liberation Movement (Frelimo) launched its campaign to win independence from colonial Portugal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano says he fears that Dhlakama is only playing for time, as he tries to turn his ruthless military organization into a political party that can compete in the multiparty elections that are scheduled to be held one year after a cease-fire is signed. &quot;He wants to use me to build himself up,&quot; Chissano says, referring to a possible meeting. But the president says he is willing to take this risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano also expresses disappointment about the stance of the mediators in the Rome talks -- the Italian Roman Catholic lay community of Saint Egidio. Founded by 10 students in 1968, the order has grown to 15,000 members worldwide and has gained a reputation within Roman Catholic circles as a more liberal version of the larger and better known Opus Dei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the community first went to Mozambique just after independence in the mid-1970s at a time of considerable tension between the church and the government, which seized church-run schools and other properties in retaliation for the church's history of ties to the Portuguese colonial authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When church leaders in Mozambique offered to attempt the mediation effort a few years ago, the government accepted, believing the intervention might succeed since the church could not be seen by Renamo as having a pro-government bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as talks continue without producing a settlement, dissatisfaction with the mediators has grown. In the view of some observers, the mediators have failed to press Renamo, which has repeatedly stalled the proceedings by not appearing for scheduled sessions and by introducing last-minute agenda changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renamo also violated the partial cease-fire, signed in December 1990, and has rebuffed all attempts to speed the pace of the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspicions of an ecclesiastical bias against the government have been reinforced by the actions of Archbishop Jaime Goncalves of Beira, Mozambique's second largest city, who has shared the mediation role with Saint Egidio. In one unpopular move last year, Goncalves mandated the exclusive use of the Ndau language in all churches in his diocese, which spans the provinces of Manica and Sofala where approximately two-thirds of the people speak Sena. Since the Renamo leadership and many of its followers are Ndau-speaking, this was taken as evidence of the archbishop's leanings, and public demonstrations denouncing his action took place in Beira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To strengthen Renamo in negotiations and elections, Dhlakama is seeking to boost his international stature and ties. After long seeking an audience with the Pope, the Renamo leader was invited to the Vatican last November. But, because of Renamo's history of brutality against civilians, he was received only by Monsignor Claudio Cellim, undersecretary for foreign affairs, and not by the pontiff. Among Renamo's latest victims are a Catholic priest, two nuns and 23 lay catechists killed at a Catholic training center near Inhambane, which lies between Maputo and Beira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pontiff, who had visited Mozam-bique in 1988 and seen some of the war victims himself, apparently differed with the church mediators over this issue of meeting the Renamo leader. At the same time, various elements from within the church, including the Archbishop of Nampula, the Africa Working Group at Maryknoll and the Catholic Institute for International Relations in London, have begun to lobby the mediators to put equal pressure on Renamo and Frelimo to end the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To encourage Renamo's cooperation, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Botwana's President Quett Masire met Dhlakama on July 4 in Gaborone, the Botswana capital, where the rebel leader reportedly agreed to enter cease-fire talks in exchange for a personal meeting with Chissano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are widespread fears that Renamo will continue to delay, sticking to a demand for constitutional talks to precede the signing of a truce. This may reflect the influence of Renamo supporters in Portugal, who want the constitutional amended so that they can reclaim property confiscated at independence or be compensated for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African government gave backing to the demand for constitutional reform, outlining this position in the three-page memorandum presented to Chissano when he stopped off in Cape Town on his return from the Earth Summit in Rio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renamo is receiving advice in the negotiations from Thomas Haussen, a South African lawyer from Witswatersrand University, from Bruce Fein of the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., and from David Hoile, founder of the Mozambique Institute in London. Among other known Renamo supporters are several American fundamentalist religious groups, such as the Shekinah Ministries in Jacksonville, Florida, the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, Christ for the Nations, and television evangelist Pat Robertson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rome meanwhile, after a month of stalling, Renamo finally agreed to begin discussions on military issues at the beginning of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mediators, perhaps in an attempt to boost their credibility, arranged a meeting in Rome on July 10 between the leaders of some 15 Catholic communities with personnel working in Mozambique and the Renamo and Frelimo delegations in Rome. The two delegations were presented with several thousand petitions from church personnel, urging them to end the war for the sake of the suffering people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later the same day, the mediators convened a session with United Nations relief agencies to work on an agreement to allow food into areas affected by the drought, regardless of whether these areas are in Renamo or the government-controlled territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite misgivings about the lack of progress in Rome, many Catholics and others continue to pursue peace efforts. In an Easter appeal, the Archbishop of Maputo called on Renamo soldiers to lay down their arms. &quot;You who are killing us, who burn and loot our houses, who kidnap the innocent and who oblige us to flee every night, you who create terror in our neighborhoods, this is not the way you will win the justice you say you are seeking,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano expresses sorrow that the United States and other Western governments appear unwilling to play a larger role in forcing an end to the fighting. &quot;They claim they don't have any leverage over Renamo,&quot; he says. But he obviously believes much more could be done.-30-</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1827 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maina Kiai</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A disturbing trend is gradually emerging in Kenya as the country begins to edge away from its past history of tyranny and dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition parties have decided to put all their energies and focus on contesting elections, with a view to replacing an incumbent regime that has lost credibility both nationally and internationally. As soon as they are in power, critics assert, they will implement the reforms necessary to rid Kenya of its repressive and corrupt legacy and restore democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy assumes that the primary obstacle to democracy, good governance and respect of human rights is the government and the people running it. It follows, therefore, that the struggle for democracy is close to completion once the government and the individuals running it are replaced in free and fair elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a serious and an unacceptable misdirection of focus. It is not that the individuals running the government in Kenya were born with a &quot;special&quot; repressive and corrupt streak that members of the opposition parties do not possess. The injustice and greed that have characterized the regime of President Daniel arap Moi are a product of state structures deliberately created to be repressive and corrupt. Anyone in his shoes, clothed with the same vast economic and coercive powers of state, would almost certainly do the same. Without changing the constitutional and institutional orders to reflect a commitment to democratic norms, changing the government is meaningless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even at a purely practical and pragmatic level, the strategy of focusing all attention and energies on elections is flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, there is no guarantee that the opposition parties will actually win. Cote d'Ivoire in 1990, and Burkina Faso more recently, demonstrated the foolhardiness of counting out the existing regime as a force -- whatever its human rights or corruption record. If this fate befalls Kenya, woe to those who challenged and ridiculed the people in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repressive regimes always control all aspects of life in their countries, including media, and do not hesitate to use them. With illiteracy running to about half the population in Kenya, control of radio waves can make a significant difference in any electoral contest. Nor should one discount the impact that the prolonged use of intimidation and patronage tactics could have on an electorate that is poor and dependent on government largess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, opposition parties cannot be certain that they will win enough seats to implement their stated legislative agenda of restoring democracy. The leading opposition party, Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD), will not only face stiff challenge from the ruling party, the Kenya African National Union, but also from the Democratic Party (DP) that is generally composed of wealthy conservatives who were part of the government until December 1991, when opposition parties were legalized. While DP claims to support democratic reform, the fact that its leadership never articulated concern for democracy until it was safe to do so casts doubt on its commitment. Nevertheless, the party has gotten some support because it appears better organized and funded than FORD, because it tilts toward an upper middle class that has more influence than its size and because it appeals, to some extent, to certain ethnic groups that have been alienated by the Moi regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, even if the opposition were to win a landslide victory, there is no guarantee that the new rulers will restructure Kenya's legal and institutional framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the enormous powers at the disposal of the president and his or her government, it would take a Herculean effort to convince any president to voluntarily reduce those powers. Thus, the temptation would be to release political prisoners while leaving the laws that persecuted them intact; to verbally affirm and permit free expression and free press while maintaining the legal right to control them in the future; to prosecute individuals closely associated with repression and corruption; and to institute investigations and commissions of inquiry into some of the more abominable acts of the previous government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, it is by no means clear that the free and fair elections will take place. Indeed, some observers, pointing to Mobutu Sese Seko's extended tenure as president of Zaire after his constitutional term expired in December, are skeptical that Moi will permit elections that he could lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent events in Kenya are disturbing. Registration of voters, which began on June 8, was immediately followed by an opposition call -- later withdrawn -- for a boycott, due to a perceived bias in favor of the ruling party. Independent organizations such as churches concurred. They noted that the Electoral Commission is tied closely to the present regime. It is funded by the government; its members were appointed by the president; and it has inherited the structures of provincial administrations that were formerly responsible for conducting elections. In effect, it is nothing more than an arm of the present government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most frightening is the violence and terror that has been unleashed on the people of western Kenya and the Rift Valley. The violence there is believed by many to be tied to political tensions between the government and the opposition. The conflicts have caused hundreds of deaths and have forced thousands to flee their homes.The Moi regime has done little to check the killing, preferring instead to issue statements deploring the trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many independent observers believe this attitude exists because the government (or high ranking officials in the government) is behind the violence. According to one eyewitness, the terror is being perpetrated by well-organized groups of warriors with significant government support. The warriors have camps from which they plot their attacks on unsuspecting villagers.  The eyewitness, who was abducted in order to provide free labor for the warriors, saw the murders of hostages. Before he made his escape, he witnessed an inspection tour by a close Moi associate -- a government official in charge of the area. Food, medicines and weapons are air-dropped from government helicopters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the National Christian Council of Kenya following on-site investigations asserted that Vice President George Saitoti was hosting warriors on his land and that former energy minister, Nicholas Biwott, who remains close to Moi, was financing the groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two possible objectives for this violence. Either Moi is trying to make the country unstable and volatile as an excuse for imposing martial law and suspending the constitution and civil rights. Or, the individuals in the regime are signaling that they have the capacity to wreak havoc if they are replaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan opposition seems to see the stunning electoral defeat of Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia as a model for Moi's loss of power. But this is misleading, for there are notable differences between Zambia and Kenya. While Kenneth Kaunda was no democrat, he was not nearly as repressive as Moi.  Zambians, for the most part, had some political space within which dissent was tolerated. The judiciary was often independent and frequently refused to sanction the persecution of some of Kaunda's harshest critics. The labor movement was cohesive and independent and operated as a significant check on the state. It is instructive that current Zambian President Frederick Chiluba was the long-time leader of that nation's labor movement. The fact that Zambia is the most urbanized country in Africa made it easier to organize the opposition and disseminate information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zambia, the opposition coalesced into a single unit to contest the elections. Given the wrangling within the Kenyan opposition movement, different parties are unlikely to form a coalition for the election. In fact, some observers expect FORD to break up before the elections that are scheduled to be held next March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is most disheartening is the opposition's total focus on the vote. Basic democratic rights should never be dependent on the outcome of elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is of utmost importance, therefore, that the necessary foundation for Kenya's future democracy be laid before the election takes place.They include constitutional amendments to reduce presidential power, to limit presidential terms, to provide for effective impeachment procedures and to adopt an absolute and enforceable Bill of Rights. These reforms would abolish the laws that permit indefinite detention without trial, that make criticism of the government and president a criminal offense, that restrict the freedom of association and that control the press and media. Kenya also must have an impartial and independent judiciary and police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy consists of rules and norms that govern behavior and conduct of power between elections. It is a culture that needs deep roots to survive.  The United States, with its long democratic tradition, must promote these ideals over the easier option of elections without democratic foundations.  Without a similarly firm foundation in Kenya, the struggle for democracy and human rights is bound to be long and arduous, no matter which party wins the elections.-30-</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIEWPOINT</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2227 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George Saitoti</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irreversible Steps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the time comes to review the history of Kenya, I believe that our achievements, particularly in this recent and testing period, will be judged in a positive light. In the short space of seven months, guided by the statesmanship of President (Daniel arap) Moi, we have taken fundamental and irreversible steps to lead Kenya to multi-party democracy. Each stage of this sometimes daunting exercise has been in accordance with the provisions of our Constitution. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Registration of Voters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have now reached the stage where, with the registration of voters, the countdown to multiparty elections has truly begun. Nearly 6 million Kenyans have already registered -- an encouraging figure. The registration process began on 8 June and the Electoral Commission has used its powers to extend the 30-day registration period by a further ten days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Setting up the registration process has been a huge task. To speed up the process and cut down congestion and unnecessary queuing, 5,631 registration centers were established throughout the country, each with four or five registration clerks and a supervisor. Considerable resources have gone into this operation in terms of materials, personnel and transport. More than 6,000 vehicles have had to be hired in various parts of the country. Particular efforts have been made to persuade young people to register once they have obtained their identity cards at the age of 18.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in place are the mechanisms of checking and cross-checking before the voters' roll is finally certified. The temporary roll of voters -- before certification -- can be inspected by any person to see if his or her name is on the register and also to object to the registration of any person who should not be on the register. There are legal limits, too, for the length of this exercise. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electoral Commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 41 (1) of the Constitution stipulates the creation of an Electoral Commission. The independence of the Electoral Commission has been greatly strengthened through the amendment to section 41 (7) of the Constitution to provide for security of tenure of the members of the commission. Subsection 9 provides that, in the exercise of its functions under the Constitution, the commission is not to be subject to the direction or control of any other person or authority. The term of office of the current commission expires in September 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building a Responsible Opposition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the repeal of section 2A of the Constitution, and the subsequent mushrooming of political parties, the government has striven to establish the necessary administrative machinery to ensure a smooth transition to elections under a multiparty system. The government has been able to set up this machinery despite strident and often negative calls by the opposition to hasten the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been disappointed by the performance of the opposition, which at each step has attempted to frustrate the constitutional process. In the era of multiparty democracy, we need a responsible opposition. Earlier this year the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) campaigned for a nationwide strike which, if it had succeeded, would have caused great damage to our economy and to the livelihood of our people. It failed to gain support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the international community is fully aware, the process itself requires time and meticulous planning -- it cannot be rushed. Recent developments have vindicated the government's approach. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holding of Elections</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are often advised to announce a firm date for elections -- to eliminate, we are told, a key element of uncertainty. Let me make it clear that our Constitution is quite specific on this issue. Section 59 (4) states that Parliament, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for five years from the date when the National Assembly first meets after dissolution and shall then stand dissolved. We have, since independence, held elections within the constitutional framework -- in 1969, 1974, 1979, 1983 and 1988. Strictly speaking, the five years start from the date of the first session of Parliament. Thus the current parliamentary term ends in March next year.  However, it remains the prerogative of the president to call an election earlier -- similar to the (prerogative of the) prime minister in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reform and Key Legislation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... Major reforms were made following the recommendations of the Kanu (Kenya African National Union) Review Committee, which I chaired in 1990 and which solicited the views of our people throughout the country on a wide range of issues. Queue voting and the 70% rule were abolished, as was expulsion from the party as a disciplinary measure. Security of tenure for judges, the attorney general and the auditor general was also restored, and the Constitution of Kenya (amendment) Act 1990 strengthened their position by providing for tribunals to be appointed in any case where the question of removing or investigating a judge arose. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethnic Loyalties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... Kenya remains one of the least urbanized countries in the world, and particularly in the rural areas, strong tribal and ethnic loyalties remain -- even among those who have lived together peacefully since independence.  These rivalries came to the surface earlier this year, and the result was a loss of life and property we greatly regret. Nor, must it be said, were the forces of law and order -- partly due to limited resources -- able to cope fully with the situation. However, peace has been restored, and security forces have been deployed in sensitive areas. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I must state categorically that there is absolutely no truth in the allegations that the government fomented these clashes. Apart from being morally unacceptable, it would have been politically counter-productive. After all it is the government that inevitably gets the blame when law and order break down. Instead, it was the opposition which took advantage of the strains in the social system -- and tried to benefit accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Creating the Right Environment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... We accept that freedom of expression, association and assembly are the bedrock in which democracy is founded. Since the first major FORD rally in January, opposition parties have held rallies and meetings all over the country -- and all news agencies and broadcasting services report these meetings extensively. Freedom of the press, for example, is a totally established fact in Kenya -- and periodicals, often vitriolic in their criticism of the government, are published regularly. However, the sad fact has been their irresponsible and often wildly distorted reporting at times -- particularly during the period of the unfortunate ethnic clashes. I should like to urge the various sections of the press to be responsible, objective and fair at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's respect and commitment to human rights is unequivocal. As a party to the various international instruments on human rights, Kenya has put into place legal and constitutional framework to effect the protection of human rights. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of this on-going review process, several of the so-called political prisoners have been released. There are no political detainees in Kenya just as there are no refugees living abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greater Transparency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are committed to a fully transparent political and economic system in Kenya. Parliament, the press, which reports parliamentary procedures fully, and watchdog bodies, such as the Public Accounts Committee, are all part of a transparent and accountable system. However, we are now strengthening this transparency. We have introduced anti-corruption legislation and have set up an anti-corruption unit. Certain senior public servants have already been moved from their jobs and prosecuted. In the Finance Bill, currently before Parliament, measures to ensure greater transparency are outlined. We aim to cut through bureaucracy, rationalize licenses for new business operations and regulate tendering procedures while cutting out single sourcing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the return to multiparty democracy was not a powerful enough challenge on its own, we have had to contend with poor rains, severe drought in the northeast and an enormous influx of refugees. The refugee crisis is an appalling additional burden for us to bear, and we have no idea when the influx will stop. The impact on the economic and social life of our own people in the border area is horrendous. The strain on resources -- our infrastructure -- on the local environment is intolerable. Many refugees are armed and come into the country in armed bands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we are grateful for international support in terms of food and medical assistance, this problem requires serious international attention. We are, after all, hosting one of the largest concentrations of refugees in the world -- around 750,000 at the present time. There must be a long-term program to deal with this situation, and this must include a concentrated international effort to put Somalia back on its feet. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drought</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the refuge problem, we are afflicted by serious drought with over a million Kenyans now at risk. We have over the years been self-sufficient in food production -- and, in fact, have not had to import basic foodstuffs since 1984. Other countries in Africa are similarly suffering, but our own situation has not received the same international attention. As a result, we have (unlike other countries) been forced to buy food commercially.  This does not seem to be an even-handed approach to a serious regional problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Withholding of Funds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further heavy blow has been the withholding of critical financial resources in the form of fast-disbursing loans and grants since the meeting of the Consultative Group for Kenya in Paris last November. These resources were intended to finance the structural adjustment program negotiated with, and approved by, the donor community. The abrupt withholding of this quick-disbursing aid -- in excess of $ 350 million -- which was scheduled for expenditure programs and macroeconomic forecasts, has caused a general decline in economic activity. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic Reform Through Efficiency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government continues its commitment to the promotion of economic efficiency through reform as stipulated in Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986. The implementation of the reforms has been accelerated by means of a number of economic measures since the donor meeting in November 1991. The thrust of all these measures has been to obtain greater efficiency in resource use and the re-establishment of fiscal discipline. The deficit has come down from 6.3% of gross domestic product in 1990-91, to 3.5% in 1991-92, and I have tabled the 1992-93 budget to reflect a two percent deficit. ... n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Kenya moves towards multiparty elections, scheduled to take place sometime early next year, debate over the country's political future grows sharper. Opposition groups, legalized last December for the first time since 1969, continue to complain about the pace and the particulars of the government's election preparations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the administration of President Daniel arap Moi contends that the preparations for the vote are moving ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan Vice President George Saitoti toured Europe this month to campaign for a resumption of international assistance to Kenya. Aid was suspended by major donors late last year to pressure Moi to end one-party rule and reform what donors regard as corrupt and wasteful economic practices.  Pro-democracy forces within Kenya have supported the aid cut to strengthen their demands for political and economic change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saitoti argues that the government and the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu) has met or is in the process of meeting all the prerequisites for renewed outside assistance, and he predicted that aid might be restored after a visit to Kenya in September by a team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This week, we present the views of the government -- in the form of Saitoti's major address in Europe -- and of Maina Kiai, executive director of the newly formed Kenya Human Rights Commission, which has offices in both Nairobi and Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Joaquim Alberto Chissano of Mozambique has returned home from a two-week U.S. trip earlier this month with some welcome news.  Several promising ventures by American mining companies appear to be moving ahead, offering the prospect of a much-needed boost for the country's post-war reconstruction after peace is finally achieved. The economy is one of the world's least developed, as a result of 12 years of civil war and five centuries of Portuguese colonial rule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano visited Washington and New York to promote his country's long-term economic potential. He met Secretary of State James Baker III in Washington and held discussion with business leaders in both American cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the talks, the Washington, DC-based Edlow Resources Ltd. is preparing to close a $ 400 million deal to develop titanium deposits in Mozambique. The company is reluctant to discuss the deal publicly before the details are concluded, but sources close to the firm say that Edlow, which has been active in Mozambique since the early 1980s, has located two deposits in Mozambique which have world class potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A much larger deal may be in the making with Kaiser Aluminum. During his trip, Chissano met with John Seidl, chief executive officer of the huge multinational, to discuss the construction of an aluminum smelter in Mozambique to take advantage of the energy potential of the giant Cahora Bassa dam.  Kaiser, which has operated a smelter in Ghana since the 1960s, is interested in opening another smelter in Africa, a project that could cost $ 1 billion over a five-year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key participant in the discussions between Kaiser and Mozambique is Philip Ringdahl, who handled Africa at the National Security Council for two years during the Reagan administration. Ringdahl says Mozambique, along with Cameroon and Namibia, is on Kaiser's short list of potential sites, in spite of the security situation caused by the continuation of war. Seidl may visit Mozambique as early as next month, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington attorney Robert K. Kelly, who is negotiating with the Mozambican government on behalf of several other U.S. firms, says investor interest in Mozambique is on the rise.  Kelly is in practice with John P.  Sears, a former Reagan campaign manager who until recently served as a principal Washington lobbyist for the South African government. n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire Richard Nyberg * for Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than three decades, Felix Houphouet-Boigny has piloted Cote d'Ivoire through cocoa-based economic prosperity and subsequent financial collapse. Now people are asking if the aging leader, recently returned from a nearly five-month absence, can rescue the nation from the worst political crisis in its history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago Houphouet-Boigny, Africa's most senior leader, became one of the first of the continent's autocrats to bend to burgeoning popular demands for political pluralism. He legalized opposition political parties, allowed an opposition press, and held the country's first multiparty elections for Parliament and the presidency. But Laurent Gbagbo, who stood unsuccessfully against Houphouet-Boigny in the presidential balloting, along with other opposition leaders faces a jail term stemming from a series of incidents in February that reflect the level of tension caused by the severe economic crunch.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incidents began February 18, when Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) and other dissident groups protested Houphouet-Boigny's refusal to punish Gen. Robert Guei, the army chief of staff, for ordering a night raid on dormitories of Abidjan University in May 1991. A government-sanctioned commission found Guei responsible for the crackdown, during which several students were raped and beaten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The February demonstration attracted hundreds of rowdy youths who, brandishing clubs and stones, left the march route and attacked the courthouse where a student leader, Martial Ahipeaud, was being tried. About 300 arrests were made and 75 people were sentenced from one to three years for helping organize the march. Ahipeaud was subsequently sentenced to three years in jail on charges of fomenting student unrest and resurrecting a banned student union. Gbagbo and nine others received two-year sentences for their roles in the February march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 23, after three postponements, Judge Yapo Yanon appeared before the court, saying that he could not read his verdict as planned. The audience was told to return in a week. But the verdict didn't come. State prosecutor Tia Kone, acting on instruction from the Ivorian Justice Minister, on June 26 urged the Supreme Court to take Judge Yanon off the case on &quot;grounds of legitimate suspicion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recent press reports have presented Judge Yapo Yanon as a 'democrat' fighting for the same cause as the accused,&quot; Kone told the court. With that motion, the case has been indefinitely set aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics charge that Houphouet-Boigny forced the action against the judge in order to appear magnanimous by granting clemency to Gbagbo and his co-defendants; government critics want a clear-cut acquittal by the court.  Diplomats here see the chance to grant clemency as an opportunity for Houphouet-Boigny to boost his popularity at a time of severe economic difficulty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition groups are not letting up. Last month, the FPI called for Prime Minister Alasane Ouattara and his cabinet to step down to make way for a transitional government. Meanwhile, everyone is waiting for Houphouet-Boigny to act.-30-</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third round of elections in Nigeria has failed to quell uncertainties surrounding the country's progress towards democracy after nearly nine years of military rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July 4 voting for a two-chamber national legislature was largely peaceful, with few allegations of fraud or mismanagement. A moderately liberal party won slight majorities in both bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But human rights groups and government opponents continue to question the military's procedures for establishing an elected civilian government in Africa's most populous nation, where soldiers have ruled for more than two of the country's three decades of independence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election was a contest between the only two legal parties, the slightly left-of-center Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the more conservative National Republican Convention (NRC), both created in 1988 by the government of President Ibrahim Babangida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November and December, voters supported the two parties in nearly equal numbers, with the NRC gaining a slight majority in state gubernatorial races and the SDP gaining an edge in state assemblies and local councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this month's national balloting, the SDP took 47 Senate seats to the NRC's 37, and 310 House seats to the NRC's 267, narrowly emerging a winner in the last vote before the presidential election, scheduled for December 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the attempt of the Armed Forces Ruling Council to create national constituencies for the two parties, which it named, organized and financed, many of the votes apparently were cast along regional and ethnic lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SDP has won landslide victories in the mainly Christian, Yoruba-speaking southwest, including the capital, Lagos, and carried the multi-ethnic &quot;middle belt&quot; states. And the NRC has swept the mainly Moslem north, where the Hausa and Fulani populations are dominant. The NRC won twice as many seats as the SDP in the predominately Christian, Igbo-speaking east and southeast, and SDP candidates fared well in some parts of the north, Kaduna, Kano, and the region bordering Lake Chad. However, the largely north/south, Moslem/Christian split evident in the results confirmed the findings of a survey published in the Nigerian weekly magazine Newswatch. Some 70% of 100 Nigerians in the &quot;top executive bracket&quot; said religion and ethnicity would play a part in their choice of a candidate for president, Newswatch reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the July 4 vote was the first legislative election in Nigeria in 12 years, less than a third of eligible voters cast ballots. Human rights groups and government opponents blame the low turnout on lack of enthusiasm for an election heavily controlled by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides creating the only legal parties, the government, through the National Electoral Commission (NEC), disqualified 28 candidates (a week before the election). Officials say that people were disqualified for being too young, owing taxes, having criminal records or being morally unfit, but the authorities refuse to give specific reasons, citing the privacy rights of those removed from the slate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC decreed that citizens must vote by forming lines behind a picture or some other symbol of their candidate, arguing that public counting would prevent the fraud that was commonplace in past secret ballot elections.  But critics believe the queuing system allows people with power to sway voters, whether the influence is by employers over workers or husbands over wives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recently formed Campaign for Democracy (CD) has called on the government to abandon its transition program in favor of a national conference, representing a diversity of Nigerian religious and civic organizations, to establish &quot;genuine&quot; multiparty democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want the right to form political parties and vote for the policies and leaders we like,&quot; says Beko Ransome-Kuti, chairman of the CD and one of five pro-democracy activists released early this month on bail after being held as long as 42 days on treason charges. &quot;We don't want to be told what to do by generals.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Acworth * for Africa News Service As Angola heads for its first multiparty elections, scheduled for September 29- 30, an American business group is lobbying to increase U.S. public and private support for the United Nations team that is monitoring the process.  &quot;Angola's devastated infrastructure is presenting tremendous logistical challenges for the UN Verification Mission (Unavem), whose responsibility it is to ensure free and fair elections,&quot; the United States-Angola Chamber of Commerce said in letters distributed to business leaders this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter registration that was to have concluded by late July is &quot;progressing, but slowly,&quot; a recent UN report concludes. According to Angola's National Electoral Commission, less than half of the nation's eligible voters have been registered. Logistical difficulties have slowed the process, which has been extended into August with the consent of both major political groups, the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, a rise in banditry has raised concerns about the social costs of the transition to democracy. Tens of thousands of soldiers from both sides have slipped away from demobilization camps and are roaming the countryside with their weapons in an increasingly desperate search for food and shelter. In recent weeks, crime in the capital city of Luanda has claimed the lives of several foreigners, including the wife of an employee of a French oil company and several Portuguese businessmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two former top Unita officials, Miguel N'zau Puna and Tony da Costa Fernandes, who left the movement in a disagreement with Savimbi earlier this year, say Unita is keeping as many as 20,000 soldiers out of the disarmament camps, holding them in reserve in case of an electoral defeat. The soldiers are said to be some of the best trained and most experienced of the Unita forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegation has resulted in an unusual dialogue between the Bush administration, which backed Unita during the civil war, and the Angolan government, which has asked the United States to share intelligence, including satellite data, about Unita troop movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The request came in an unannounced meeting at a Washington, DC hotel in late May between Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Herman Cohen and two senior Angolan officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources close to the talks, Cohen told the officials -- General Jose Maria, the Angolan president's national security advisor, and Jose Leitao, secretary of the MPLA Council of Ministers -- that the U.S. is equally concerned about MPLA forces that still have not been demobilized. Cohen is said to have offered to provide the satellite information, but only if the MPLA is able to pinpoint more precisely where the soldiers may be located, a request the Angolan government apparently is unable to meet. Unita has vehemently denied the charges that it is withholding its crack units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Cohen visited Luanda, where, according to U.S. officials, he advised both dos Santos and Savimbi to tone down their attacks on each other and to concentrate on implementing the election timetable as outlined in the U.S.-mediated peace plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the Africatrek cyclists ride across Africa to make Americans more aware of the continent, they will have another objective as well. Buettner and his team hope to interest Africans in making greater use of bicycles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for Burkina Faso in West Africa and a few other countries, bicycling is not as popular in Africa as it is in many parts of the world.  Sometimes bicycles are even banned from highways by governments, says David Mozer, author of Bicycling in Africa: The Places in Between.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conjunction with Africatrek, Rotary International has pledged to send 1,000 used, cleaned and repaired bicycles to Kenya and Tanzania. Don Kuplic, chairman of the Rotary Bike Project in Burnsville, Minnesota, says the organization is raising $ 25,000 to transport the vehicles to Africa. Bicycles will be given to health workers, teachers and others chosen by local Rotary clubs, Kuplic says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his book, Mozer extols the bicycle as a means to &quot;move underdeveloped, largely impoverished Africa into a healthier, more productive, more prosperous and sustainable society.&quot; The bicycle is inexpensive, can be used anywhere, does not pollute and would cut the travel times now required to walk or to carry wood, water and other heavy loads, Mozer writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this potential is so widely overlooked that the word &quot;bicycle&quot; does not even appear in a World Bank urban transport policy statement released in the late 1980s, Mozer says. &quot;Despite the fact that the cost of energy has put most African countries deeply in debt, and despite the fact that pollution and congestion are strangling the major urban centers on the continent, it is business as usual for the policy makers,&quot; he writes.-30-</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veteran U.S. cyclist Daniel Buettner is preparing for a record-setting trip that he hopes will focus international attention on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1987, Buettner's 16,000-mile, Guinness World Record-setting ride from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, to Tierra del Fuego, Chile, was covered by the Associated Press and several outdoor magazines. Three years later, Buettner led a 13,000-mile trek through parts of the Soviet Union previously closed to North Americans. Reports by NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show, David Letterman, National Public Radio and large daily newspapers drew the notice of an estimated 300 million Americans to the U.S.S.R., Buettner says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later this year, Buettner hopes to make the record book again, as part of a multiracial, international group that will depart from Bizerte, Tunisia -- the continent's northernmost point -- and travel to Africa's southern tip.  Guinness lists no one as having traversed Africa from north to south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we did the Soviet trek, (the area) was a place the world had been turning its eyes to,&quot; he says. &quot;I just feel that Africa will be a continent people in the West will start turning their eyes to in the mid-1990s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Daniel Buettner will be his 27-year-old brother Steven, James (Chip) Thomas Jr., a 35-year-old physician who has worked in Liberia, and an African rider to be chosen from among candidates in Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The Buettners are white. Thomas is African American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicity for the ride is already underway. &quot;Africatrek, &quot; as the planned eight-month journey is called, has its own quarterly newsletter. The third issue has just been published. And Buettner says CNN, ESPN and the Washington Post have indicated an interest in covering the venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project also has an educational component. The Center for Global Environmental Studies at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, is developing materials for teaching students about the geography, culture, history and environment of the continent through Africatrek. Computerized progress reports and a toll-free telephone hotline will help pupils in classrooms around the United States track the cyclists on their journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Clough, outgoing senior fellow on Africa at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City, says Africatrek is a start at changing the continent's negative image, fostered by media coverage that focuses almost exclusively on cruel and corrupt governments, wars, disease, droughts and famine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see this as part of a much broader approach to the need to acquaint people with Africa as an interesting part of the world and to begin to reach people who are not Africanists,&quot; he says. &quot;It has the potential to be a very important event.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buettner says he himself had a negative image of the continent from reading screaming headlines and hearing about the continent's problems. &quot;The State Department sent me a packet of information on Africa that read like descending strata in Dante's Inferno,&quot; he says. &quot;If you talk to people who have never been (to Africa) before, they always know someone who's been shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the cyclist says that conversations with Peace Corps volunteers and other experienced travelers have given him a broader view of the continent. He says he is looking forward to seeing some of Africa's natural beauty, cultural richness and economic potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volumes have been written about the difficulties and dangers of traveling in Africa. &quot;We inherit a burden because much of the information and news coverage on Africa focuses on crises,&quot; says David Mozer in Bicycling in Africa: The Places in Between. &quot;The result is an exaggerated awareness of the tragedies, without a knowledge of the opportunities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buettner knows that he and his colleagues must prepare for any of several significant hazards -- dehydration, disease, banditry, political unrest and potentially fatal altitude sickness on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To meet the challenge of riding the 1,680-mile Trans-Saharan Highway from El Golea in Algeria to Niger's Agadez, the Africatrek cyclists will carry 20-liter bags of water to help them quench their thirst between water sources, some 150 miles or more apart. They also will tote an &quot;earth location device&quot; to help them navigate in the desert. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is supplying the device in exchange for data on climate and vegetation that the riders will collect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Much of the pavement is broken and unusable,&quot; Buettner says. &quot;The Sahara is no game.&quot; Two Canadians and a Japanese bicyclist died in the desert two years ago when they lost their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the greatest threat to the biker's safety, he believes, will be the same hazard that confronts cyclists in the United States -- traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Africatrek makes its way south out of the Sahara, the bikers will see glimpses of the continent's vast diversity. The group is scheduled to pass through both Abidjan -- Cote d'Ivoire's coastal metropolis of skyscrapers and sidewalk cafes -- and the legendary Timbuktu, a dusty town in rural Mali that once was the crossroads of trading routes on which ancient empires were built.  &quot;At the beginning of this millennium Timbuktu was one of the most important cities anywhere,&quot; Buettner says. &quot;I still get people all the time who ask whether it really exists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From West Africa, the team will travel eastward, through tropical forests along the equator, to Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, the tallest free-standing mountain in the world. They will end the journey in South Africa at Cape Agulhas, where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans meet.-30-</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Reed Kramer * Africa News Service Two lingering African conflicts are claiming human lives in staggering numbers, largely outside the public eye. The wars in Somalia and Mozambique seem to sidestep every attempt at resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the United Nations and the world community at large have mustered little energy to bring the suffering to an end. &quot;It is clear that the only crisis that matters to the powers-that-be in the Security Council is the crisis in Eastern Europe,&quot; says Ambassador Legwaila Joseph Legwaila of Botswana, who after 12 years in his post is the longest serving African envoy at the UN.  &quot;People are dying by the thousands in Africa, but no one here is convening urgent consultations. Our crises don't spark that kind of response,&quot; he says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But several recent developments, including an unannounced trip to Somalia by a prominent Republican U.S. senator and a quiet intervention in Mozambican negotiations by two African presidents, may be pointers to an increased international focus on solving the two escalating conflicts before the death toll reaches record levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations estimates that 100 children are dying every day in Mogadishu, Somalia's war-wracked capital, and that 4.5 million people -- of a total population of about 7.7 million -- face starvation throughout the country. An estimated 30,000 Somalis have been killed in fighting that began with the ouster of former dictator Siad Barre at the end of 1990 and continues with inter-clan rivalry that leaves the nation in the grip of political paralysis and economic disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mozambique, another catastrophe-in-the-making -- as a result of a deadly combination of brutal war and spreading drought -- starvation-caused fatalities are already being reported. The mortality rate will climb rapidly unless the ongoing peace process succeeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Massacres, mutilations, the forcible relocation of population and the forced recruitment of soldiers -- many of them children -- have been characteristic of a war that has claimed thousands of lives,&quot; says the human rights group Africa Watch in a new 200-page report on Mozambique, Conspicuous Destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situations in Somalia and Mozambique are probably the most serious, due to the continuation of fighting there. But the impact of the drought throughout southern and eastern Africa, parts of which have only recently seen conflicts ended, has put some 50 million people under the threat of severe famine, according to a recent warning from the Washington, D.C.-based relief and lobby group Bread for the World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the international community rallies to safeguard lives amid civil strife in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, a crisis of epic proportions in being neglected a continent away,&quot; says Bread for the World's Sharon Pauling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to focus attention on the suffering, the Senate Africa subcommittee's ranking Republican, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, took advantage of the Senate adjournment for the Democratic Convention in mid July to schedule a visit to Mogadishu, which has seen almost no high-ranking official visitors since large-scale fighting last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kassebaum, who also scheduled stopovers in Khartoum, neighboring Sudan's capital, and Nairobi, was cosponsor with Senator Paul Simon (D-IL), the subcommittee chairman, of a resolution adopted by the upper chamber in May calling on the United Nations to &quot;remain committed to the diplomatic and peacemaking tasks&quot; in Somalia to facilitate emergency relief assistance to the country &quot;as a matter of highest priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UN-sponsored cease-fire has halted the worst fighting in the capital, but relief work remains a risky endeavor, since food is a principal focus of competition between the two well-armed factions, and no neutral source of law and order exists. UN attempts to deploy 50 military observers have met with numerous obstacles, and the relief effort was dealt a setback when a Russian plane that had been chartered to deliver emergency supplies made an unauthorized flight from Nairobi carrying a cargo of cash to one of the sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though both parties have come under international pressure to end their dispute, neither self-declared interim president, Ali Mahdi, nor Gen.  Mohamed Farah Aideed has shown any willingness to compromise on claims to the leadership. Despite this standoff -- and the prospect that clan-based rivalry could spread fighting to other parts of the country, a new report from the Congressional Research Service in Washington strikes one positive note.  &quot;Although the Somali conflict may seem unresolvable, most observers find the character of the Somali culture to be forgiving and compromising,&quot; says the author, Theodros S. Dagne, an international relations analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent effort to breath life into the Mozambique peace process was spearheaded by President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Quett Masire of Botswana, who held a day of discussions with the Mozambican rebel leader, Afonso Dhlakama, to persuade him to agree to a cease-fire and speed movement toward a comprehensive peace accord with the government of President Joaquim Chissano. In the meeting, which was also attended by the U.S. ambassador to Botswana, David Passage, Dhlakama agreed to end his attempts to delay the peace talks underway in Rome. In exchange, he asked for a meeting with Chissano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the significance of the outcome is uncertain, since Dhlakama has backed down from previous pledges, including a commitment in an April meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen to move cease-fire discussions to the top of the agenda in Rome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africa Watch report, funded by the J. Roderick MacArthur Foundation, examines the war and the government's political reform program and accuses both the army and the rebels of &quot;indiscriminate killings of civilians,&quot; although the report concludes that &quot;the largest massacres have been carried out by Renamo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military abuses and human rights violations in combination have resulted in &quot;reducing much of Mozambique's population to a state of chronic famine,&quot; Africa Watch says.-30-</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko has complained privately to foreign ambassadors that if the country's national conference does not change its tack, he will overstep its authority and head straight to elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu, at his request, met with the ambassadors of the United States, France and Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler, in mid August. He told them the conference's proposals for a transition period prior to elections were unacceptable, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mobutu is said to favor a one-year transition rather than the 18-month to two-year period proposed by the opposition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president was infuriated earlier this month when the conference, a gathering of representatives from Zaire's civic, church and political groups, decided to revert to the country's old name, the Congo. Mobutu discarded that name in 1971 in favor of his personal choice, Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government threatened to set up its own constitutional commission and blacked out transmission of the forum -- which was being broadcast live on state-run television. But broadcasts resumed and the conference decided to include its proposed name change in a constitutional referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since promising in November 1990 to hand over power to a democratically elected government, Mobutu has played his opponents off one another to maintain control of Zaire behind the scenes. His current presidential term expired last December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources say Mobutu feels humiliated by the conference and its president, Roman Catholic Archbishop Monsengwo Pasinya, who received an unusually high-level welcome during a visit to Washington last month seeking support for the democracy process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herman Cohen, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African Affairs, at the end of July delivered a letter from President George Bush urging Mobutu to allow the conference to proceed peacefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials say the letter was stronger than one Bush sent to Mobutu last March, urging reopening of the conference, which the government had suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, conference executives have been interviewing candidates for a prime minister to replace Mobutu's appointee, Nguza Karl-i-Bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources say Mobutu told the ambassadors he would not accept a prime minister who is from Zaire's Kasai region because it would inflame ethnic tensions in mineral-rich Shaba province -- rival to the Kasai area -- and promote its secession. Opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi is from Kasai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Shaba provincial capital, Lumumbashi, already has experienced student protests and crackdowns by security forces in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year Mobutu appointed Tshisekedi as prime minister but fired him when he defied orders.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time last year, Col. Albert Zapanta, U.S. Army Reserve, was a man on the spot. A United Nations peacekeeping mission was due in Western Sahara, on Africa's north Atlantic coast, to supervise a September 6 cease-fire.  Zapanta was head of the contingent of some 30 Americans assigned to the international force, known as Minurso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission's first task was to monitor the cease-fire between the army of Morocco, which claims the former Spanish colony, and guerrillas of the Polisario Front, who have been fighting for the territory's independence. The UN team also planned to organize a referendum that would allow Saharans to choose between independence or union with Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Moroccan government was stalling. Finally, after a flurry of high-level meetings, UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar gave the go-ahead at 9 p.m. on August 29. An advance team of peacekeepers would arrive in Western Sahara by the cease-fire date -- if they could get there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zapanta went into action. Throughout the Labor Day weekend, he notified mission personnel to get ready, plotted logistics, and lobbied Pentagon officials. The U.S. Air Force agreed to fly the group of nearly 50 people -- American and Canadian military personnel and UN civilians -- from Andrews Air Force base directly to the Western Saharan capital, El Aaiun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We arrived at 1 o'clock in the afternoon on September 5,&quot; Zapanta says. &quot;Obviously, we took the Moroccans somewhat by surprise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most of the next six months, Minurso -- which has grown to about 350 people -- sparred with Moroccan officials in an attempt to get deliveries of essential supplies. &quot;We had no equipment,&quot; says Zapanta, &quot; and no means of providing food or water other than whatever we could buy.&quot; Shelters were &quot;tents we were able to round up and set up in some locations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Minurso supplies were blocked at the Moroccan port of Agadir, peacekeeping troops were deployed to remote desert posts. &quot;For four months we never saw the equipment such as our ablution units,&quot; says Zapanta. &quot;The comforts to make life habitable were locked in the port of Agadir and the Moroccan authorities were the ones holding it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the beginning, the mission members didn't even have their radios.  &quot;There were many, many times that we were not in communication with our team sites, which meant that if somebody got really sick or got hurt, we couldn't evacuate them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the radios arrived, the situation improved -- a little. Diarrhea was a constant threat and at least four soldiers got amebic dysentery from the lack of clean water. &quot;Because of the heat, they dehydrated so bad that we almost lost a couple of people,&quot; Zapanta says. &quot;Thanks to the superb Swiss medical team, which had a plane, our people were evacuated and stabilized and after about a week or so were able to get back on their feet.&quot; Still, Zapanta says, &quot;we were very, very lucky that things did not happen that we couldn't respond to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extremes of temperature in the desert was a constant problem. &quot;Toward the beginning of December it became very cold. It was 39 degrees, almost freezing, and our people did not have the capability to keep themselves warm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About that time, a few supplies filtered through, including vehicles, but the satellite-linked ground positioning systems were kept in port. Zapanta says that being unable to know exactly where you are in the Western Saharan desert is more than an inconvenience. &quot;We would drive for eight or nine hours and never see a live soul, so our people were out there and their lifeline was less-than-adequate equipment.&quot; Particularly worrisome were the land mines.  &quot;After 17 years of war,&quot; Zapanta says, &quot;there were minefields and neither side knew where they were. The shifting sands covered them up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says both Morocco and Polisario had casualties from mines. &quot;Here are people who know the area and they are still getting blown up, so you can get a pretty good feeling how we felt. Eventually we got sandbags -- we didn't even get that until January -- so we could put them on the floorboards and at least have some protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After about the second month, Zapanta says, the morale of his forces began to plummet. The colonel became concerned, too, about his teams' objectivity. &quot;You started to see a marked animosity towards the Moroccans by the military in the field,&quot; he says. &quot;They knew the equipment was blocked in Agadir. They felt that they were being abused and the Moroccans were at fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the other hand,&quot; he says, &quot;where the Polisario didn't have much to give, they did try to give whatever they had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And where Polisario was cooperative, Morocco was obstructionist.  Morocco refused UN observers access to several areas. &quot;There were two instances, in particular,&quot; Zapanta says, &quot;where American officers were forcibly stopped at gunpoint and weapons were loaded and cocked.&quot; Moroccans threatened to shoot the Americans if they tried to carry out their orders. Moroccans also refused to provide the UN team with their troop positions and strength, as required by the peace agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first day we met with Polisario,&quot; Zapanta says, &quot;they gave us their order of battle and their troop dispositions.&quot; In addition, when Morocco failed to cooperate, Polisario shared its intelligence information with the UN teams. &quot;So we were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">able to use what the Polisario gave us to find out where the Moroccans were,&quot; Zapanta says. &quot;I thought that was rather interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zapanta worried that the different attitudes of Morocco and Polisario to the peacekeepers would compromise the impartiality of the mission. Feelings were especially friendly towards Polisario when guerrillas helped Minurso members find shelter and shared food and water with them. &quot;You started to run the risk, in my estimation, where the American soldiers -- and I had to worry particularly about them as well as about the rest of the force -- were starting to skew their attitude in favor of the Polisario. The Polisario were helpful and fairly open and shared what little they had, where the Moroccans were trying to control whatever they could.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zapanta recommended to his military superiors that the American members of the UN team be rotated out after six months and that a new group be sent to replace them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, he swung into action again. At Thanksgiving he returned to the U.S. to ask UN authorities for greater support for the mission and to press Moroccan officials at the UN for more cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The personnel under his command credit him with forcing Moroccan compliance, at least to the extent of allowing supplies out of port faster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Pickart, a staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says Zapanta was largely responsible for making it possible for Minurso to function effectively. Although there has been no referendum and the political stalemate persists, the cease-fire has held for a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickart visited Western Sahara on behalf of the committee chairman, Senator Claiborne Pell (D-RI). The staff report Pickart wrote, which documented Zapanta's descriptions of conditions, drew attention to Minurso's problems and paved the way for Senate hearings on the mission, scheduled for next month.  Zapanta will testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, he acknowledges, a strange role for him to play. He's a military man, not a policy maker, and he has been comfortable with that role.  But when he saw political factors interfering with the health and safety of the people under his command in Western Sahara, he felt responsible for solving the problems. He says he'll share with the Senate panel his conclusions about the Saharan deadlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It became very clear to me,&quot; he says, &quot;that the United States represents the key country or key element in the whole force and mission.  Morocco looks to the U.S. as its strongest and longest-standing ally and friend. Polisario looks to us as the strongest nation and -- when we flew in -- they felt we were the country that made the breakthrough and really began the peace process. So the United States is the country that can make things happen because of its credibility with both sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zapanta concedes that the role of aggressive peacemaker in Western Sahara requires Washington to shed its ambiguity on the democratic process in the region. &quot;I do think you get caught in a dichotomy,&quot; he says. &quot;From a strategic, bilateral relationship, the U.S. wants to see a stable Morocco.&quot; That has meant, he says, that U.S. officials have backed the idea that &quot;the existing power structure stay intact.&quot; King Hassan II of Morocco, one of the world's last absolute monarchs, has staked his throne on holding onto the phosphate-rich Western Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, says Zapanta, &quot;as part of the UN, we want to see self-determination for the Western Sahara, so we backed the peace plan and the referendum.&quot; The two views, he says &quot;are not exactly in concert with one another, and so the U.S. finds itself in a rather tough position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the long term, Zapanta believes, the U.S. will be best served if &quot;we as a country do back the peace plan. And so I think we want to see the referendum go forward.&quot; Zapanta believes that the monarchy is so determined to hold onto Western Sahara that some negotiated compromise will be necessary before a vote is possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That won't be easy. Morocco and Polisario remain far apart on criteria for voter registration. Polisario accuses Morocco of flooding the territory with Moroccans to pack the ballot boxes in the king's favor. Morocco denies it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 11, Morocco announced that it will hold its own elections, including balloting in Western Sahara, during the first week of September.  Diplomats regard the move as a ploy to preempt the UN-supervised vote.  *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire by Richard Nyberg for Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the opposition Ivorian Popular Front (FPI), released after serving over five months in prison, is calling on the government to share power with its rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cote d'Ivoire legalized opposition political parties in 1990. FPI leader Laurent Gbagbo ran against President Felix Houphouet-Boigny in presidential elections that year but lost badly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have proposed nothing,&quot; Gbagbo said upon his release. &quot;We are open to all forms of discussion. We want to make serious propositions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He blamed Cote d'Ivoire's disastrous economic situation on the ruling Democratic Party (PDCI). France earlier this month granted its former colony a $ 200 million loan to help repay arrears on loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gbagbo and 74 others were jailed February 18 after a protest march they organized in Abidjan ended in rioting. President Felix Houphouet-Boigny introduced an amnesty law July 24, which was adopted by legislators five days later. A jubilant crowd of about 9,000 supporters welcomed his release at a rally August 9 held in a sports stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FPI leader, defeated in his bid for the presidency in 1990, said his party and other opposition groups are prepared to sit down and talk to the government, which is dominated by the PDCI. The ruling party holds 165 of the National Assembly's 175 seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, no plans have been made for discussions between the two sides.  But PDCI Secretary-General Laurent Dona-Fologo told the government daily, Fraternite Matin, that his party is ready to talk. &quot;We are in favor of opening dialogue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomats here say it is too early to speculate on the strength the fragmented opposition might bring to negotiations. The FPI is exploring a merger with the smaller Ivorian Workers' Party (PIT), led by Francis Wodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have formed two delegations which are in the process of discussing the possibility,&quot; Gbagbo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others freed under the new amnesty include student leader Martial Ahipeaud and human rights leader Rene Degne Segui. They say they will continue to fight for their causes, despite the risk of being returned to prison under an &quot;anti-vandalism&quot; law enacted along with the amnesty.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN, Cote d'Ivoire Cindy Shiner for Africa News Service Comlan Dossou lay bleeding on the floor of the Punch Coco Number One dance club when he reached into his back pocket in a desperate attempt to save his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His parents, Gregoire and Monkoule Dossou, were at home a few blocks away and heard the gunshots. On a street corner six hours later, neighbors would tell them what happened. Newspapers the next morning would show them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As his friends tell it, Comlan was trying to give police his student identity card when they shot him again, this time fatally. The 14-year-old was among 10 people gunned down at the club that Sunday night by units of Abidjan's newly formed Anti-Crime Brigade, which more and more Ivorians are criticizing as a group of thugs who shoot first and ask questions later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've got to stop crime,&quot; said Aime Mian Kadio, a reporter with the opposition La Voie newspaper, who is investigating the shootings. &quot;But killing is not the answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivorians and expatriates agree that stronger measures to fight crime in Abidjan were needed. Diplomats have complained to the government of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny repeatedly about poor security. The residences of the ambassadors from Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic and Nigeria have all been robbed. Two years ago, bandits raiding an Abidjan restaurant gunned down the Italian ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now many restaurants are deserted in the evening, due to fear of both the bandits and of the eager police who chase them. In the poor areas of the city, where crime hits hardest, many residents are afraid to leave their homes after dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the public outcry, the government last year allocated $ 125,000 to support national efforts aimed at curbing crime. Ivorians applaudedthe measures initially, but now appear to fear security forces almost as much as the bandits. Police have killed more than 50 people since beginning an intensive crime sweep in this city of 2 million four months ago. Almost daily, government newspapers such as Ivoir Soir and Fraternite Matin splash gruesome pictures of the latest victims across their pages. Comlan's body appeared on the June 29 front page of Ivoir Soir under a red banner headline: &quot;Cops Strike Ten Times.&quot; Next to the photo of Comlan was a photo of the body of a 15-year-old girl, also killed in the shooting. The back page displayed more victims, as well as a gun, knife and grenade seized at the club. Police did not say which of the suspects possessed the weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivorian police had staked out the Punch Coco Number One in the Vridi Canal industrial zone of Abidjan for two weeks before making their hit. Ivoir Soir said police had received a tip that a gang of bandits was preparing to rob the home of a rich merchant nearby. Police said the gang members had gone to the bar to drink or take drugs prior to the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses say seven police from the Anti-Crime Brigade, dressed in civilian clothes, infiltrated the bar that Sunday night. According to authorities, the gang leader threw a grenade at the police. Although it failed to explode, panic caused pandemonium in the crowded, dimly lit night club. By the time calm was restored, 10 people were dead and several others wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">La Voie reporter Kadio says it is difficult to know which of the victims, if any, really were bandits. But he said criminals' bodies usually go unclaimed. At least six of the dead at the Punch Coco club, including Comlan, were identified by family or friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have declared the hit a victory. But the parents of Comlan and the 15-year-old girl angrily deny that their children were bandits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For us, it was a job well done. Because of the police, the population has security,&quot; said a Security Ministry official who asked that his name not be used. &quot;A young person who is armed and on drugs is just as dangerous as an adult who is armed.&quot; The official defended the tough police response to crime.  &quot;It's not necessary to kill,&quot; he said, &quot;but if they are better armed than the police, you can't let the bandits kill the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war in neighboring Liberia has made arms easier to obtain in Cote d'Ivoire, authorities say. And the country's deepening economic crisis is pushing more people, many of them impoverished immigrants, to use the weapons.  West Africa magazine says 60% of Cote d'Ivoire's criminals are not Ivorians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the economic center of West Africa, Cote d'Ivoire attracts immigrants from the nearby countries of Ghana, Mali, Guinea, Liberia, Togo, Benin and Burkina Faso -- home to Comlan's family before they moved south. Cote d'Ivoire's population doubled to 12.6 million between 1975 and 1990, including about 2.5 million migrant workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's faltering economy cannot support the burgeoning population. Unemployment has risen sharply. Foreign debt is estimated at $ 15 to$ 17 billion and the state commodities marketing board owes almost $500 million to exporters of cocoa and coffee, the country's leading revenue producers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Monetary Fund last month praised Cote d'Ivoire's economic recovery efforts and pledged further support for the reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But residents of neighborhoods like Vridi Canal see little change. The urban shanty towns seethe with banditry, open sewers and resentment of police harshness. There is a widespread suspicion among Abidjan residents that police are being paid up to $ 400 for each suspected criminal they kill. &quot;The police have become bandits. They're one and the same,&quot; said Jacques Arron, a friend of Comlan Dossou, who witnessed the shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comlan's father says the night of the shootings was &quot;real terror.&quot; He and his wife turned off the lights and crouched on the floor of their tiny home when they heard the gunfire. &quot;The police can't just kill people like that, like you kill a chicken,&quot; he says. His wife sat nearby, virtually catatonic for an hour, raising her eyes only to acknowledge a parting visitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dossou said he has filed a complaint to police about the death of his son and has visited the authorities repeatedly to request information about the shooting. &quot;Everything now depends on what the government does,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was the future of my home,&quot; he says of Comlan, the oldest son of nine children. &quot;He was my light, completely. For the rest of my life I will never see that light again in my house.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, from Richard Nyberg for Africa News Service Signs of the famine stalking southern Africa are starkly visible in this southwest corner of Zimbabwe. Drought has withered the region's primary corn-producing fields, threatening commercial livestock and water supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bulawayo, water is tightly rationed. The main reservoir reportedly holds only five percent of its capacity, and city taps run just two hours a day. Public anxiety is growing at the prospect of layoffs for thousands of workers -- such as those on irrigation projects -- whose work depends on adequate water supplies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price of cornmeal, the area's staple food, has shot up in response to the shortages. &quot;Malnutrition now has become one of the highest causes of hospitalization in the country,&quot; says Health Minister Timothy Stamps. &quot;People, particularly children, are literally dying due to lack of food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waves of drought refugees squatting near the railway station in Gweru, 150 miles to the northeast have overloaded municipal sanitation services, increasing the risk of cholera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As feed costs rise, ranchers are unloading cattle at bargain prices to thin their herds. Western development officials in the capital, Harare, predict that as many as 2 million of the nearly 4.5 million cattle owned by communal peasant herders may die before the next rains are due in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 200 cattle a month are dying already in Bikita, according to district counselor Noah Makunde. Makunde has asked the government to subsidize loans for farmers to purchase tractors, to offset the anticipated shortage of animals to till the soil for the next planting season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis has been a shock to a country accustomed to exporting grain. Critics of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund say the two agencies encouraged Zimbabwe to sell its reserve stocks of grain last year to earn money to meet debt payments. Over one million tons of surplus corn was sold -- enough to meet this year's shortfall for eight months. And there are widespread public complaints that the government of President Robert Mugabe could have staved off tragedy by prompt action when the threat of shortages became apparent as early as last October. Many here believe that although drought created a problem, poor policy planning led to the current disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the cause, Zimbabwe is now totally dependent on commercial food imports. Nearly two million tons of corn, wheat, sorghum, rice and sugar are needed before the earliest possible harvest next June.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopes of accelerating economic growth in Africa this year are being dashed by a widespread drought in nearly 20 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, tens of thousands are dead and the livelihoods of millions more are being destroyed as the drought threatens to undermine already difficult economic reform efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say growth in the continent in 1992 will now probably fall below the predicted 3.5 percent range earlier forecast and could drop to less than 2.5 percent. The final outcome will depend on whether rains fall later this year and on the faltering pace of economic recovery in industrial countries, where slower than expected growth is further adding to fears for growth in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists agree that growth must be sustained at four to six percent if living standards are to rise even minimally during the 1990s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the economic impact of the drought likely to extend through 1993, World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials warn that economic reform programs risk being derailed unless additional funding is made available to offset the wider economic consequences on affected countries. &quot;Steps will need to be taken to safeguard the implementation of IMF-supported programs,&quot; IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus told the April meeting of the Fund's Interim Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With reforms already hurting living standards, countries are facing mounting political instability as they try to adhere to often unpopular adjustment programs. Many programs are already being modified. &quot;Any new government is in danger of being swept away; any old (government) is likely to feel forced to Ttighten up' in the face of the very real threats to social and political order, as well as to itself,&quot; says Professor Reginald Green, an adviser to the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a May 26 appeal on behalf of SADCC, Botswana's President Sir Ketumile Masire warned that the drought was not only putting lives at risk, &quot;but will also wreak havoc on the economic stability&quot; in several countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a series of appeals over the last three months, the UN has called for some $ 2 billion in emergency assistance for over 40 million people facing famine in 16 southern and eastern African countries. Drought has also caused large crop losses in Morocco, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has warned, while natural and political factors are causing severe food shortages in Liberia, Madagascar, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Togo and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scale of humanitarian needs will further strain already tight aid budgets. Most of the aid requested is in the form of food shipments, with some funding directed to meeting health and transport bills, but international agencies argue that action is also needed to minimize the longer-term economic impact of the drought. The IMF has already supplemented Mozambique's enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) by $ 21 million and granted new credits for Lesotho to help compensate for the impact of drought. Additional funds could follow for other affected countries, such as Malawi and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, the World Bank in June approved $ 310 million in loans for four southern African countries -- Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  Further funding for the four could come from redirecting or accelerating disbursements from existing bank credits and from additional bilateral sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If rains fall later this year, this strategy should cope with the situation in southern Africa, bank officials say, pointing to the underlying strength of most economies. But the situation is very different in the Horn, where there has been a slower donor response to emergency appeals and economies are weaker. A combination of civil war, political problems and disagreements over economic policies is both thwarting relief efforts in many areas and keeping the IMF and World Bank from marshaling longer-term economic assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only Sudan -- where agricultural production is sharply up -- is expected to show growth this year. For Kenya, economic growth in 1991 was already a disappointing 2.2 percent, George Saitoti, vice president and finance minister, announced in his June budget. It could drop closer to one percent this year, according to Nairobi sources, as the government battles economic and political problems. Drought is compounding this situation, adding to food import costs. Low water levels have already led to power shortages, shutting down factories and further raising the import bill as water-generated energy is replaced by oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Horn gives the greatest cause for immediate concern, it is the impact of drought on southern Africa which has altered most dramatically the economic picture for Africa this year. Relatively fast growing economies like Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland are badly affected. Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe, which were expecting growth in the range of two to four percent, have also been hit hard. According to government and World Bank estimates, Malawi's gross domestic product (GDP) could fall by some four percent this year, Zambia's by more than six percent and Zimbabwe's by as much as nine percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agricultural output has fallen by up to 60%, and the IMF puts the cost of food imports alone for the region at between $ 800 million and $1.2 billion. Green puts the cost higher, at $ 1.775 billion, with an additional $500 million in transport and distribution costs. Zimbabwe has announced a $ 946 million Emergency Drought Relief and Recovery Program. For Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia alone, the bank estimates drought-related financing requirements in 1992-1993 at $ 800 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of food losses -- and the consequent surge in import requirements -- reduced crops for cotton, sugar and palm nuts will hit export earnings as well. In Zimbabwe, industrial output will be badly affected by a shortage of cotton for the important textile sector, threatening jobs as well as earnings. The government is moving to make foreign exchange available to firms to enable them to import cotton. This will further worsen the country's balance of payments -- the current deficit could climb close to $ 1 billion thisyear from last year's level of under $ 700 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rapidly rising prices are accelerating inflation rates, while jobs and livelihoods disappear as factories close and farms fail. Countries like Zimbabwe are beginning to experience increased migration to the towns as thousands flee the devastation in rural areas, only to threaten to overwhelm already inadequate housing, health and sanitation facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many countries funding is geared to making sure that smallholder farmers have both the resources and the incentive to resume production quickly. Referring to Zimbabwe, where smallholders now account for 60% of marketed maize, one official commented: &quot;we must insure this success story isn't put at risk.&quot; This strategy also includes greater emphasis on the provision of water.  Zambia has already asked donors to fund a thorough review of the country's water resources with a view to developing more small-scale sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank officials say their latest fast-disbursing credits are to ensure that meeting the costs of the drought does not drain funds from ongoing adjustment efforts. But implementing tough adjustment measures is proving increasingly difficult and politically dangerous as the consequences of the drought further hit already precarious standards of living. Planned targets for reducing balance of payments and budget deficits -- including those for state-run industries -- are being raised to reflect the need for increased spending. With inflation accelerating, plans to remove price controls are being delayed and reductions in subsidies slowed. In Zambia, for example, the last subsidy on maize -- on roller meal -- is to remain for the time being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zimbabwe there has been strong criticism of the running down of the country's large maize stockpiles in recent years. Bank officials agree some strategic stocks are necessary, but argue that carrying stocks sufficient to deal with drought does not make economic sense. &quot;A country needs financial reserves, not large grain reserves,&quot; one comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank expects most economies in southern Africa to show significant recovery in 1993, though the lingering effects of drought will mean that, at best, it will be 1994 before economies make up all the ground lost in the recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding is coming through for most southern African countries, though Malawi still faces some shortfall, in part because of donor concern over human rights issues. This is also true for Kenya, while disagreement over economic policies and civil unrest will prevent anything but the most basic emergency assistance going into countries such as Ethiopia, Liberia, Somalia and Zaire.  Sudan has recently undertaken a series of economic reforms, including large devaluations of the Sudanese pound, but a combination of disagreement with the IMF on the size of the budget deficit and with bilateral donors over human rights issues is preventing their receipt of most economic aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Low and even negative economic growth, therefore, is likely to plague a significant number of African countries, while even for the more resilient economies of southern Africa, the impact of drought effectively means two lost years in the battle for sustained growth.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across five thousand miles, two continents and racial and cultural divides, Cheryl Shotts of Indiana, saw a young African nomad on television and wanted to be his mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Diane Sawyer was doing a story on famine in a country called Mali, which I had never heard of,&quot; Shotts says of that day in 1985 when she saw Mohammed's face on &quot;60 Minutes.&quot; &quot;She interviewed a boy for 18 seconds, and I don't know why, but I immediately felt he was my son and I had to find him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shotts was newly married then, with three grown children from a previous marriage. She and her husband, Charlie, were determined to adopt Mohammed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called the State Department, the United Nations, the Malian Embassy, the Peace Corps and the International Committee of the Red Cross, but made no progress. Charlie Shotts took a six-month unpaid leave of absence and the couple used up $ 5,000 in savings and borrowed another $7,000 to continue the search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they finally found him, Mohammed was a 13-year-old street kid, living off his wits and the kindness of strangers. He had a gift for making friends who helped him survive, including a dozen members of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who were stationed in Mali. The arrival of the Shottses in his life also gave him a family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed flew with Charlie Shotts from the Mali town of Gao, near Timbuktu to Indianapolis, Indiana -- and Americans for African Adoptions was born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency that the Shottses established to help other people do what they had done grew out of the Sahel drought of a decade ago. The famine that ravaged northwest Africa disrupted traditional patterns of life and left thousands of children to fend for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although still small, the Shottses' agency has expanded and has contributed significantly to the trickle of children leaving Africa for new homes with American parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adoptions from abroad account for an estimated one-third of all adoptions in the United States. But in fiscal 1991, adoptions from Africa accounted for only 41 of 9,008 international adoptions, according to the U.S.  Immigration and Naturalization Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1985, Americans for African Adoptions has placed 59 children from Ethiopia and Mali with American families. That number will rise to 69 in October, when Cheryl Shotts returns to Ethiopia for two 10-month-old babies, the agency's youngest adoptees yet, and eight other children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only a home office and without salaried staff, the agency is struggling to place about 350 children. They come from as far apart as Liberia, on the west coast, where two years of war has orphaned many youngsters, and Uganda, in east Africa. Shotts says she hopes to overcome reluctance from prospective parents due to fears of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to seeking families for the youngsters, the agency is looking for sponsors for children awaiting adoption. Cheryl Shotts says it costs from $ 25 to $35 monthly to support children in their own countries until adoptions can be arranged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far all the couples adopting through Americans for African Adoptions have been white. That fact has led to criticism from some who believe that black children should be placed only with black families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Association of Black Social Workers (NABSW) issued a statement in 1972 against transracial adoption that caused most agencies to abandon the practice, according to Elizabeth Bartholet, a Harvard Law School professor and the author of, &quot;Where Do Black Children Belong?: The Politics of Race Matching in Adoption,&quot; published in a recent volume of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Black children belong -- physically, psychologically and culturally -- in black families, in order that they receive the total sense of themselves and develop a sound projection of their future,&quot; the social workers' statement says. &quot;Black children in white homes are cut off from the healthy development of themselves as black people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty years later, the NABSW maintains its position. A May 1992 Association report says African American children raised in white families will not learn to feel positive about their race or receive the skills necessary for coping with racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Child Welfare League also believes adoptions should be arranged within the same race and same culture, although it thinks there are times when international or transracial adoptions are necessary, says spokesperson Joyce Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheryl Shotts says she sees the placements as &quot;transcultural&quot; rather than transracial and believes black families would also have a difficult time bridging the cultural gap. &quot;These are not African American children; they're African children,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shotts has received a letter from a black social worker accusing her of committing genocide, and she was asked to leave a minority caucus she tried to attend during a Washington, DC, adoption conference in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartholet, an advocate of lowering barriers against transracial adoption in the United States, writes that a review of studies on the practice shows that black children placed in white homes adjust well, seem fully integrated into their adoptive families and develop strong senses of racial identity and self-esteem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shotts says of the 59 children that Americans for African Adoptions has brought to this country, only two have experienced serious adjustment problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says the failure of her agency to recruit black families to adopt African children is not for lack of trying. She says she has done dozens of interviews with radio and television stations, including those reaching predominantly African American audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although she will keep trying to broaden her outreach to potential parents, Shotts argues that the children placed by Americans for African Adoptions cannot wait until the agency finds African American adoptive families. &quot;We're talking about kids who are going to starve to death,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taye Gemeda, an Ethiopian social worker who helps the program locate children who need homes, says an adoptive parent's race is not an issue for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The children have nothing to eat, they have nothing to wear,&quot; he says. &quot;Americans for African Adoptions is saving lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We figured there weren't any other kids who needed us more,&quot; says Temple Moorehead, a South Carolina elementary school teacher who, with her husband, Kevin, adopted a 3-year-old Ethiopian girl and a 7-year-old Ethiopian boy through the Shottses' agency. &quot;We don't know (whether) they would have survived if they'd stayed (in Addis Ababa),&quot; Moorehead says. &quot;This is the best thing we ever did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlie and Cheryl Shotts encourage adoptive parents to keep their children's African names, learn about the countries their children are from, and expose the children to Africans and African activities, Shotts says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mooreheads have hung Ethiopian baskets on the walls of their children's rooms and bought books on the country. They stayed up late with their son, Ismael, to watch Ethiopians compete in the Olympics. Now, Temple Moorehead says, the family plans to move to Virginia, nearer to Washington, DC, where they can have more contact with Ethiopians and Ethiopian food and culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was scared,&quot; Ismael Moorehead says of how he felt when he first arrived in the United States. He says he stopped being afraid when he learned English. After 16 months in the United States, Ismael speaks fluent English, is learning to read and shows great promise in math, his mother says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ismael says he misses Ethiopia &quot;a little bit&quot; and will return there on visits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's long-term goal is that the adopted children return to Africa to help the continent, Shotts says. One boy adopted from Mali, who required 46 surgeries to repair damage to his face, wants to go back to the country of his birth as a plastic surgeon, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheryl Shotts admits that caring for any child is a challenge and that adopting impoverished children who have experienced massive trauma is particularly intimidating. But she is passionately insistent that the effort pays off for everyone involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Shottses' son, Mohammed, had some vague ideas of what to expect of life in the United States from his contacts with Americans. But years spent in the streets and in refugee camps, without parents or schooling, left him unprepared for life among American teenagers. &quot;He could speak six languages,&quot; says Cheryl Shotts, &quot;but he didn't know how to hold a pencil. He didn't know red from blue or how to tell time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took five moves from school to school before Mohammed found one -- a private, Jesuit institution -- where he felt comfortable and able to thrive.  Now he is doing well academically and says he wants to study political science or international relations. He says his aim is to become secretary of state some day.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Reed Kramer * Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration is boosting U.S. support for the United Nations monitoring effort in the upcoming Angolan elections. In a letter to UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on August 3, President Bush offered the use of three C-130 airplanes &quot;to assist with demobilization of soldiers and to support the electoral process.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president called a successful outcome in Angola a &quot;personal foreign policy priority.&quot; The U.S. government, which supported the anti-government Unita movement in Angola with covert military aid, brokered the 1991 peace accord that led to plans for the vote, scheduled for September 29 and 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pentagon has dubbed the deployment of the planes &quot;Operation Provide Transition.&quot; A directive issued by the U.S. Air Force Command in Europe earlier this month calls for &quot;continuous airlift operations&quot; in Angola until the end of September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush said the U.S. already has contributed $ 3 million in humanitarian assistance and about $ 30 million for the transition and electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Defense Department also is considering the dispatch of National Guard units to help transport approximately 1,000 international observers who are expected to monitor the process. After completing a cost analysis this month, administration officials will probe the budgets of various agencies in search of the required funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a visit to Washington in July, the UN special representative in Angola, Margaret Anstee, pinpointed Angola's inadequate transportation system as one of the major challenges for the successful implementation of her mandate. The National Guard operation would use helicopters and small fixed-wing aircraft to move monitors from site to site.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several times in recent days she's been interviewed on National Public Radio.  The BBC cites her on major international newscasts. The Washington Post quotes her repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message is always the same: fighting in devastated Somalia is largely over the limited supplies of food. The quickest way to ease the conflict and save lives is massive food aid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rakiya Omar, the executive director of the human rights group Africa Watch, jokes that she's becoming a bit tiresome. &quot;At this stage I feel I'm getting to a point where I should just say, THold on, here's my cassette.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then she becomes serious. &quot;No, that's really not true,&quot; she says, in a telephone interview from her London office, &quot;because I feel so much outrage that it's not difficult to get very passionate.&quot; Omar, who is Somali-born, says a sharp increase in food shipments is the only possibility of feeding Somalia's starving millions without a major military intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid groups say that a cease-fire between rival factions in Mogadishu, the capital, has held for five months. But marauding gangs continue to fight over any possible source of food. All movements of relief supplies are now heavily guarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar says that because food is such a scarce commodity, controlling supplies has become a way to amass power and gain strategic advantage over rivals. She is frustrated that so many diplomatic pronouncements on the Somali crisis focus on security considerations rather than on the need for more food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no way to move on to addressing the many ills plaguing Somalia unless you take food out of the equation,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why we're saying that we must flood the area with so much food that there'll be no incentive for gangs to divert it or unscrupulous merchants to horde it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid groups in Somalia agree. &quot;Only massive food aid will lessen the attacks on humanitarian aid convoys,&quot; said Rony Brauman, president of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), during a recent visit to Washington, D.C. The Washington-based anti-hunger group Bread for the World also is calling for &quot;stepped up action to flood Somalia with food and other urgently needed supplies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar says such supplies include seeds and tools. &quot;Unless people have the means to plant,&quot; she says, &quot;we'll be having this same conversation this time next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid groups say the lack of widespread media scrutiny during months of mounting crisis allowed the world to ignore Somalia. That has changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists are competing to cover the story and policy makers have swung into action. In an August 7 letter to UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, signed by 20 members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Dan Burton (R-IN) asked the UN to send an armed force to see that food aid is distributed to hungry Somalis. &quot;No reasonable action alternative should be ruled out,&quot; the letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 12, the United Nations announced that it will be sending 500 armed escorts to Somalia to protect relief workers and supplies.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county has been in a political limbo for months, since a national democracy conference appointed Joseph Kokou Koffigoh as interim prime minister.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference stripped most powers from President Eyadema, who has resisted reforms and has maintained control of security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new agreement returns much of Eyadema's authority but it sets firm dates for democratic elections, which are to follow a September 27 constitutional referendum. Local elections are scheduled for October 11; national representatives are to be chosen on October 13 and 14; and presidential voting is set for December 6 and 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win Eyadema's cooperation, democracy advocates agreed to drop from the new constitution a provision that would have required the president to resign his military post before standing for national office. Eyadema, who has ruled Togo since seizing power in a 1967 coup, says he will be a presidential candidate. The pact also establishes an interim &quot;national unity government,&quot; which some fear will give Eyadema loyalists the power to influence election results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days after the agreement was reached, security forces detained journalists from the opposition newspaper Forum Hebdo, which had attacked the compromises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accord has not yet achieved its aim of ending political violence.  The home of opposition leader Ouattara Nguessan was bombed, and the Reuters news agency reported in late September that at least four people have been injured in grenade attacks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In what officials have termed &quot;unfortunate&quot; timing, Namibia took delivery of a new presidential jet just as it was appealing for international aid to deal with a worsening drought. News of the purchase from France of the $ 30-million Falcon 900B for transporting President Sam Nujoma and other government leaders provoked an outcry in local newspapers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affair also embarrassed the government with donors. Some governments, including Norway, Sweden and Germany, suspended or considered cutting drought relief assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the plus side of the government's ledger is an apparent breakthrough in sensitive talks with South Africa on the future of a disputed port city. After more than two years of negotiations, South Africa has agreed to joint administration of Walvis Bay, the largest port on Namibia's Atlantic coast. Namibia claims the port, but South Africa -- asserting historical rights to the area -- has retained control since Namibia became independent in early 1990. Namibia hopes a move toward joint administration could lead to a formal hand-over after a period of transition.</SPAN></P>

Heavy seasonal rains have slowed relief supplies, flooding potential runways for airplanes and making roads impassable in some of the most destitute parts of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief workers who sounded the alarm last year had hoped to pre-position food stockpiles before the rain arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banditry, which has escalated markedly over the past few months as the country plunges deeper into anarchy, also is plaguing relief efforts.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan Justice Minister Abu Mayanja says steps have been taken to improve Uganda's human rights record since the National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986. Government officials have responded to charges of human rights injustice by conducting their own investigations and executing army soldiers found guilty of abuses. Amnesty has urged the Ugandan government to halt what it sees as further human rights violations by using execution as a means of deterrence and punishment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Late last month, Pascal Lissouba became the first democratically elected president of the Congo, replacing Gen. Denis Sassou-Nguesso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defeated Sassou-Nguesso said the Congolese &quot;should rally around Lissouba to meet the economic challenges facing us.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, witnesses at Congo's national conference on democracy accused the former leader of ordering political assassinations and enriching himself at the public's expense during his 13-year rule. His opponents say the former leader's endorsement of the new president is a ploy to escape prosecution for his crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within a week of taking office, the new prime minister, Stephane Bongho-Nouarra, named his 28-member coalition government. The Labour Party, which had been the country's ruling and only legal party before the transition began, was originally offered only the education portfolio. However, the new president's party, the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy, holds only 40 of the 125 seats in the nation's new parliament and needed the Labour Party's support to form a new government. When the Labour Party threatened to refuse to take part in the national unity government it received two more ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the elections, a group of opposition political parties formed the Union for Democratic Renewal (URD), dedicated to &quot;constructive opposition,&quot; according to Bernard Kolelas of the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development, a member of URD. Kolelas was a candidate for president and had challenged Lissouba's victory with a complaint to Congo's Supreme Court of election irregularities. Kolelas accepted the court's decision to uphold the election, and said that URD &quot;will not constitute an obstacle to Pascal Lissouba and his government.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace talks in Rwanda have reached a deadlock over the issue of power sharing within a proposed transitional government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has proposed the establishment of a council of ministers headed by a president to serve as the interim executive body until national elections can be held.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) oppose the government's plan and are arguing for the formation of a seven-person presidential council representing all major political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government officials and RPF representatives earlier agreed to dissolve the parliament and establish a transitional legislature with representation from the RPF. The peace accord that is in the works would allow the immediate formation of an interim legislature and begin the process of organizing elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous rounds of peace talks led to a cease-fire that went into effect in August and the signing of a protocol of understanding on the rule of law. Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmed Hassan Diria is mediating the current discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ongoing peace talks have been held since July 1992, in an attempt to end a 23-month civil war following the RPF invasion of the small central African country in October of 1990. The RPF draws its members largely from the minority Tutsi ethnic group. Tutsi bitterness against the 19-year rule of President Juvenal Habyarimana has risen in recent years, as the government resisted efforts by Tutsi refugees in neighboring Uganda to return home.  Thousands of Tutsi have been living in Uganda since the 1960s, when attacks by the majority Hutu group forced them to flee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malawi dissident Chakufwa Chihana, awaiting trial on sedition charges, has been named chairman of an internal pressure group for political change. A spokesman for the group, Alliance for Democracy (Aford), said last week that the formation of Aford represents &quot;a major political development in Malawi and brings to an end speculation and anxiety over the lack of a visible pro-democracy movement inside the country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chihana's arrest on sedition charges followed interviews he gave to the international press in July criticizing the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chihana's trial was postponed until October 12, following defense arguments of insufficient time to prepare their case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A September report by Amnesty International blasts the dictatorial government of President Kamuzu Banda and calls for the release of hundreds of political detainees. An Amnesty spokesperson says the group has received reports of prisoners kept in leg irons and subjected to severe beatings and electric shock, as well as a &quot;frightening pattern of deaths in custody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing thousands at a public rally in Lilongwe, the capital, last week, Banda announced a program to distribute free corn to hungry Malawians affected by the region's drought. He also called on the international community to help Malawi combat water shortages by supporting a project to drill deep wells throughout the county. Party leaders at the rally pledged support to Banda and said that the people of Malawi would not tolerate &quot;confusionists&quot; to disturb the country's peace and calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda has released about 60 political detainees this year, but opposition leaders call the move a political ploy to appease aid donors who are critical of Malawi's human rights record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Mobutu Sese Seko and opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi are continuing on their collision course in Zaire, but this time the face-off could come at the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshisekedi was named the country's prime minister in August by the Sovereign National Conference, which has been shaping a new democratic structure to replace Mobutu's 27-year authoritarian regime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remaining disagreements between the two sides include a timetable for holding elections. Mobutu wants a vote in six months time; Tshisekedi believes a longer period is required to prepare for a free and fair vote. Both seem convinced they can triumph at the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nguza Karl-i-Bond, who served as Mobutu's prime minister prior to Tshisekedi's taking office, says he is backing the president and expects him to win. During a visit to Brussels in early September, Nguza told the Belgian News Agency that he expects to return to the prime minister's post as head of a coalition administration After the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Tshisekedi's selection, Nguza has charged the National Conference with ignoring the wishes of the people of mineral-rich Shaba, his home region. Shaba, formerly known as Katanga, attempted secession in the early 1960s, soon after Zaire's independence from Belgium. The province was the scene of serious unrest in the late 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Brussels, Nguza promised to maintain &quot;ferocious and implacable opposition&quot; to Tshisekedi's government. He said continued &quot;exclusion&quot; of the people of Shaba could lead to &quot;a new Yugoslavia or another Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy advocates in Shaba dispute Nguza's view. They supported Tshisekedi's selection as prime minister and accuse Nguza of trying to stir up secessionist sentiments in Shaba.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems to me that AfricaNews has become more American-oriented. In the past few issues there have been three instances where I thought, &quot;Wow, this isn't really about Africa, it's about the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It serves (white) Americans' image of ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first instance was the story about the bicycle trip across Africa (July 20-August 2). This might have been an interesting one-paragraph item, but it scarcely deserved the length it received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the issue of August 17-30, the article on Americans' adoptions of Africans reinforced my growing sense that it was white Americans who count.  There was a discussion of some of the qualms that African Americans have about transracial adoption, but the article lacked depth of thought as it pursued the story of philanthropic white Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, what is this picture caption?! &quot;Albert Zapanta is national director of Veterans for Bush-Quayle&quot; (August 17-30). The article to which it was attached concerned UN peacekeeping activities in the Western Sahara and relied heavily on interviews with Zapanta. But his role in U.S. politics was irrelevant to the article. What did you mean by putting his partisan activities in such an eye-catching place?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1560 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a new peace agreement holds, one of the world's longest lasting and most destructive wars may be coming to an end. Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano and rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama are scheduled to sign a cease-fire in Rome on October 1, following two years of difficult negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambicans have endured war almost without interruption since 1964, when the Frelimo independence movement launched a guerrilla campaign to end five centuries of Portuguese presence. The end of Portuguese rule in 1975 brought a brief respite, but the fighting resumed quickly, this time between government forces and Dhlakama's Mozambican Resistance Movement, known as Renamo. The 17-year conflict has resisted repeated efforts at resolution and has been marked by a high level of atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renamo was established by the intelligence service of white-ruled Rhodesia, but was handed over to South Africa's security establishment when Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe in 1980. Renamo's apparent purpose was to undermine Mozambique's support for majority rule in southern Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the conflict, Renamo has employed the &quot;systematic use of mutilation and killings and indiscriminate violence,&quot; according to a recent study by the human rights group Africa Watch. The study is also highly critical of Mozambican government troops for &quot;significant killings and attacks on civilian targets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long period of fighting has taken a grim toll on the country's 16 million people and its rudimentary infrastructure. Now the suffering is being exacerbated by a worsening drought that is engulfing all of eastern and southern Africa. According to Africa Watch, the war has been a &quot;major contributor&quot; to the current famine that threatens the lives of three million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One particularly tragic aspect of the Mozambican conflict has been the victimization of children. Tens of thousands have been wounded, many severely, and at least 200,000 have been orphaned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many years, human rights groups have tried to mobilize an international response to Renamo's practice of using child soldiers, some as young as ten years old. Thousands of children have been kidnapped by the rebels in the course of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth Minter writes occasional letters about life in war-torn Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, I came home and found a half-dozen young children deeply engrossed in creating elaborate villages of clay figures -- houses with many well-furnished rooms, with people, animals, cars, a television, a mortar and pestle, beds, chairs, tables, and outside, a soccer field. Very elaborate creative group play -- with zero materials purchased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other days the middle-sized or older boys have been absorbed by the construction of elaborate wire cars and trucks with wheels made from the two ends of a coke can tucked together like a lid on a box. The majority of these wire vehicles are equipped with long-shafted steering wheels that the boys use to guide the car as they walk along. Marvelously creative -- using mostly trash found here and there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are local varieties of hide-and-seek, dodgeball, jump rope games, marbles, hopscotch. Kites and balls of all sizes are homemade. What is obvious is that poverty is no bar to creativity and the instinct to play and to learn. Many of these children eat only once or twice a day, most are perennially barefoot, many wear what in the United States would be considered rags. There is no money in their homes to buy toys from a store, but the toys they create themselves are astounding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the joyful side of watching children here in Mozambique's capital city. But there are much more painful realities for children here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently I was privileged to translate for a group of visiting Americans when they talked with six boys who have spent time living with Renamo. Three of the children had trained with weapons and had participated in killing and looting. One had herded Renamo's cattle. Two younger boys were used for reconnaissance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youngest had shown Renamo the way to his own family's house, where the raiders stole all the belongings and food and forced the boy's mother and other relatives to serve as temporary porters to transport the goods When the child was recaptured by government troops a couple of months later, the troops called the parents in and said they could take the child home. They refused, saying they feared if he were with them, Renamo would come again. So this eight-year-old remains in limbo until social services -- or somebody -- decides what to do with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oldest boy, 15-year-old Zamito -- had been with Renamo for eight years. He was trained in the use of four heavy weapons including AK47 and tank-mounted guns, plus the detonation of chemical bombs, and the use of hand-held weapons such as knives and machetes. He described in detail the layout of the last camp he was in -- on the border with South Africa -- and the presence of South African white soldiers brought in to give the training whenever a new group was there to receive it. He himself was the bodyguard and personal servant of a Renamo commander and always accompanied him on missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the boys were asked if they feared anything while with Renamo, Zamito said, &quot;no, we used a vaccine.&quot; When pressed, he explained that the boys' thighs were cut with a razor blade and white powder was rubbed into the cut line &quot;so that we would not be afraid when we had to kill a person, and so we would not tire on long marches.&quot; Both Zamito and a 13-year-old boy said they had &quot;wives&quot; while with Renamo. Zamito said his wife was 14 years old, near his own age at the time. He said young women captured by Renamo are given to the soldiers and commanders. The commander he worked for had five women, according to Zamito.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These boys, captured at a young age by Renamo, traumatized or brutalized as they may be, are luckier than their older brothers. Yesterday while calling on a parish-ioner, I learned his wife's absence from church last Sunday was due to the funeral of her nephew, aged 16, kidnapped from Matola, a Maputo suburb, last week, then killed and left by the road. Sixteen is too old to be reliably malleable and apparently Renamo doesn't offer captives many chances to be cooperative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War, drought, rising food prices because of structural adjustment policies, higher costs for health care and education for the same reason, and desperation to survive all take their toll on children here. A nine-year-old from a family I am close to arrived at my door early one recent morning with a note which said, &quot;Please do you have a bit of corn. We have not eaten for three days.&quot; An older brother in his twenties had finally found a job, but after only one week at work had not yet brought home any pay. This same family, which lives in one room under the eaves of a rooftop, has so little money that for three months they have been unable to pay their rent -- about 75 cents a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have listened with desperate hope for word from Rome that the two-year-old peace talks have produced fruit. Meanwhile Renamo attacks continue. Roads remain too vulnerable for relief deliveries. Drought has dried even the beds of major rivers like the Zambezi. Death is a constant reality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African National Congress (ANC) and the South African government have been scrambling to patch together an agreement that will allow the country to move towards power sharing among competing parties. Both sides appeared to be eager to reach a compromise before a mid-October session of Parliament. The task was complicated by high feelings in the wake of the massacre of at least 28 people in an ANC demonstration on September 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a major interview with the Johannesburg Star on September 15, ANC leader Nelson Mandela adopted a conciliatory tone, asking the government to address his group's concerns about political prisoners, violence in single men's hostels, and the widespread use of a dangerous weapons. Three days later, in a speech to a regional meeting of the ruling National Party, President F.W.  de Klerk took a tough approach while behind the scenes, government negotiators held out some promise of concessions. Here are excerpts from the two statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My message to the government is: Make good on the undertakings you have given to us and Mr. Cyrus Vance. We are not challenging here, not demanding. It is our deep concerns we have put forward.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has happened now is that the negotiations process has lost credibility. You must realize it was a heated debate within the ANC when we decided to suspend armed struggle and to negotiate. But we convinced one another then. Now my people are beginning to say to me: &quot;What was the value?  Let's abandon negotiations, they will never be able to take us to our goal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. de Klerk can just say to me: &quot;You have expressed your three concerns. I give you my undertaking that I will address them.&quot; Just give me an undertaking that (political prisoners) will be released in the next two months. Give me a date on which hostels will be fenced and secure them. Give me an undertaking that within a month or two we will be able to ban dangerous weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will be able to go back to my people and say: &quot;Look, he has met us.  Let us meet him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you negotiate you must be prepared to compromise. But that compromise must not compromise your own position. It must be seen as an effort to move forward, to pull South Africa out of this quagmire. Therefore, if the government does something visible to show that they are now prepared to negotiate in good faith, there will be no necessity for mass action. An interim government is going to represent us all, and the ANC is not going to have mass action against itself! We will be in government, the ANC will be fully represented like all other political parties. There will be no question of sanctions. There will be no question of isolating South Africa. South Africa will go back to the United Nations -- we will be saying this. All that will remain will be the arms and oil embargoes, to be lifted as soon as a democratic constitution is accepted. But even on that there can be compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is that if an interim government is introduced, these conflicts fall away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We haven't got much time. The next elections are in 1994. The economy is falling to pieces, and that we cannot afford. I have been talking to businessmen. We have to come up with strategies that give the country and investors hope that we are working together to ensure that our economy is not destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a special interest in this. Of the 7 million unemployed, the overwhelming majority are blacks. We are sitting on a time-bomb. The youths in the townships have had over the decades a visible enemy, the government. Now that enemy is no longer visible, because of the transformation that is taking place. Their enemy now is you and me, people who drive a car and have a house.  It's order, anything that relates to order, and that is a very grave situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe business must take positions. We have said to the government we are prepared for the adoption of the constitution by a two-thirds majority, and we even went up to 70%. The government wanted 75%, and we could not agree.  I say to business, take a position. If you think we are wrong, say so. If you think the government is wrong, tell them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are well aware of the concerns of whites in this country, which are genuine, if mistaken. We are prepared for checks and balances, but that must be done in a constituent assembly. I would like to remove the concerns of business. There is the potential for cooperation. One has to be very, very careful not to use rhetoric that is going to frighten people, but rather to enable people to have confidence that we have a workable strategy -- however difficult the situation is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think business has responded very responsibly during the period of mass action. I have thanked them for that, and I have told my own supporters my view. I said we have had cooperation, and therefore we must avoid any attitudes of hostility or actions which will further damage the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the mistakes that has been made by both the ANC and the National Party is that we have embarked on an electioneering campaign while we are negotiating. One party is talking to the other while at the same time trying to undermine that party. Now that destroys that whole atmosphere of negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I have explained that we must have free political activity. We can't sit down and fold our arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I face a situation in which it becomes increasingly difficult to resist the demands of my people to arm and defend themselves. You know, when I went to Boipatong (site of a June massacre), I was met with placards &quot;Mandela, give us guns&quot;. And these were not coming from the youth, but elderly people, members of the branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then I went to the rally, and I went round as I normally do to greet people. And the song they were singing was &quot;Mandela, you behave like a lamb while you are being killed&quot;. I had to make a speech there to say I had noted what they were saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now if we don't do something visible to show that we are fighting against oppression, those who are demanding the resumption of the armed struggle are going to prevail. Mass action is actually a peaceful form of channelling the anger of the people -- for us to say we don't need armed struggle, we can make progress through mass action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You must understand that mass action is being used today throughout the democratic world and by people who have the vote. We haven't got the vote.  What else can we do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Power sharing includes proportional representation, strongly entrenched devolution of power to strong, autonomous regional governments and local authorities, the distribution of functions, and participation by major important parties in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, power-sharing -- in contrast to the ANC's power-grabbing model -- is what is needed in our complex country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implicit in this trend is the need to give individuals and communities more and more scope and freedom to do their own thing within the framework of just laws. The powers of the state should be circumscribed and limited. The state may not smother or suppress the freedom of individuals and communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be able to progress and prosper, a country -- particularly a developing one with a rapidly growing population such as South Africa -- needs stability, as well as new investments and the ability to produce and trade unhindered worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General declarations of good intentions and vague and fine promises are not enough to restore investor confidence in our country. For that we need tangible and visible proof of stability -- an end to violence, an end to irresponsible incitement and provocation, an end to uncalled-for demonstrations and disruption, an end to continued flirtations with failed Marxist ideas and obsolete economic systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of peace and stability is the single negative factor in the country at present. The continuing violence and disruptive mass actions are eating away like a cancer at the security and welfare of all South Africans.  They have brought our economy practically to a standstill. They are bedeviling the negotiating process. They are hanging over us like a dark cloud. For this the National Party and the government cannot be blamed. We reject the torrent of ANC propaganda to that effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not wish to use this platform simply to launch political attacks on opponents. For that, conditions are too serious. It has become time, however, to deal with the distorted perceptions of the causes of violence and with the suspicions being cast on the government and the National Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientific analysis of the violence plaguing our country clearly shows where the blame really lies. It is not the nationalists who frequently invite violence through demonstrations and mass actions -- it is the ANC/SACP/Cosatu alliance that is doing so. It is not the nationalists who assault, intimidate and murder political opponents -- it is the supporters of the other parties who are doing that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence will not end as long as there are important political leaders who condone it or encourage it, either directly or indirectly. Violence will not end as long as vengeance and retribution remain part of the vocabulary of certain political parties. Violence will continue as long as political intolerance persists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the National Party is saying to every political party and organization that is guilty of these things. Turn your backs on these things.  You are playing with fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the National Party is reiterating once again: We shall not let ourselves be intimidated. We know what we want and stand by it. The aims to which we are aspiring are fair and just and offer hope and progress to all South Africans. Our plan is to be able to bring peace to all and will do so.  Our proposals guarantee just, democratic participation by everybody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish to conclude on a positive note -- not merely because it is politically expedient, but because there is cause for optimism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party will continue to plan and work calmly and purposefully to be the stable anchor in a sea of political unrest; to take the lead by means of solution-oriented initiatives. As long as you, the leaders of the party in every community keep our party strong and expand it, we shall ensure that our country and all its people will be shareholders in long-term prosperity and peace. Then, however, we have to stand firm, keep our courage and not go off course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That course is aimed at:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa First; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice, as God wills it.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, within Africa, there are high hopes for the strengthening of economic integration through various regional organizations. Southern Africa in particular is seen as having a bright future, once South Africa makes the transition to a non-racial democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a move that seemed to indicate a welcome spirit of conciliation, delegations from both the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African government attended the annual meeting. Led by Derek Keys, minister of finance for the government, and Trevor Manuel of the ANC's economic planning department, the two delegations held extensive consultations with staff from the bank and the fund and with leading financial officials from around the world. South Africa has no current program with the bank or the fund, but officials from both institutions meet regularly with representatives of the major political forces inside South Africa to map out economic policies for the future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many African delegates hope a political accord can be reached soon, because they see South Africa as a powerful engine of economic growth for much of the continent. In the words of the African Development Bank's Babacar Ndiaye, &quot;the African tree has deep roots in southern Africa,&quot; and he urged African leaders to promote economic cooperation and to realize their comparative advantage as a region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the two South African delegations appeared together at a private breakfast on the first day of the meeting, however, sharp divisions emerged between Manuel and Keys over the issues of state intervention in the economy and political violence in the country. Keys's comments about opening the economy, encouraging the private sector and ending the &quot;economic civil war&quot; pleased European bankers and other potential investors in the audience, but Manuel's remarks made it clear that the two sides still have a long way to go before agreeing on how to manage the economy. Manuel emphasized the need for state action to redress the economic inequities of apartheid, and criticized the apartheid regime for not doing enough to end the violence, leading some to wonder how soon this engine of growth will leave the station.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For African countries, as with most countries in the developing world, the growing trend towards regionalization in the global trading system is a two-edged sword.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the one hand, there is the hope that unified markets in the industrialized world will improve export opportunities for poorer countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, many industrialized countries continue to maintain stiff barriers to imports from developing countries in order to protect politically important industries and farmers. Some African delegates are concerned that the emergence of regional economic blocs in Europe, North America and the Pacific Rim could raise new barriers to their products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we welcome the emerging phenomenon of regional associations, we must not allow a situation to arise in which this phenomenon results in discriminatory trade blocs,&quot; said Mohammed Berrada of Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, African delegates joined other delegates from the developing world in calling for &quot;the speedy and successful completion&quot; of the Uruguay round of negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Although critics of Gatt talks say the agreement will undermine environmental standards and workers' rights, many African governments hope the accord will improve their market access and promote their export potential.  They also see it as an essential complement to their own efforts to lower trade barriers. The G-24 communique expresses concern &quot;that the efforts of many developing countries to liberalize their economies have not met with an adequate response on the part of industrial economies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African delegates to the annual meeting say that they will continue to press demands for greater debt relief. In contrast to Latin America, where the debt crisis is easing, African countries remain heavily burdened by high levels of debt, most of which is owed to international financial institutions and official donors in the developed world. The delegates say that payments on the debt consume a large proportion of their countries' export earnings and create a serious obstacle to economic development. Africans argue that in certain cases, such as Poland and Egypt, donor countries have been willing to make a much more generous debt reduction than for most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all know that a heavy debt overhang diverts investable resources to debt servicing, and reduces the incentive to invest,&quot; said Babacar Ndiaye, president of the African Development Bank. &quot;Mexico's tremendous advances in recent years and the vibrant entrepreneurial activity that has fueled these advances are, in no small measure, due to the significant easing of the external debt burden of that economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since most of Africa's debt is owed to official creditors, the principal means for debt reduction is through the Paris Club, a group of major Western governments that handles debt negotiations. A few countries, such as Zambia, have been able to take advantage of the relatively generous &quot;enhanced Toronto terms&quot; for debt repayment established in December 1991, but those terms are limited to the poorest and most severely indebted countries, and some Western officials concede that this will not end the debt crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly for middle income countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few African countries have managed to cope with their debts. Finance Minister Bernard Chidzero of Zimbabwe, which has a diversified economy of agriculture and industry, says his country is one of the fortunate few. &quot;We are paying all our debt; it is not a burden on us,&quot; Chidzero says. But he says that poorer countries, whose economies tend to be based on one or two commodities, are in serious trouble. &quot;The poorest countries in Africa,&quot; he says, &quot;will require an imaginative program of debt rescheduling, cancellation, and interest-rate reduction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to Africa's debt difficulties, Russia has initiated moves to collect on the former Soviet Union's loans to developing countries. Pyotr Aven, Russia's minister for foreign economic relations, told reporters at a press conference here that the total debt owed to the former Soviet Union by its allies and customers in the developing world is an estimated $ 142 billion, twice the amount of the Soviet debt still owed to the developed world. Aven said that the amount owed by such African countries as Angola, Mozambique and Zambia is &quot;in the range of billions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those figures are sharply disputed by delegates whose countries borrowed from the Soviets. Africans and others say that the Russians have inflated the value of the debt by ignoring the precipitous decline in the value of the ruble. Indian financial officials, for example, say that their debt to Russia is less than $ 3 billion, much less than the Russian estimate of $10 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the results of the debate over numbers, Russia's attempts to collect on its loans have added a troublesome new dimension to Africa's debt crisis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC by William Acworth for Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As financial leaders from around the world arrived here in September for the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), African delegates expressed concern that their countries will be pushed aside in the race for economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new republics of the former Soviet Union, which have become full members of the bank and the fund, represent tremendous new competition for the limited resources available for development. Russia, Ukraine, and 12 other former Soviet republics expect to receive billions of dollars in aid from industrialized nations over the next few years, as they undergo the process of market-oriented economic reform.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans at the annual meeting say that they are ready to welcome the new members, but they are concerned that the world's attention and resources will be diverted from the problems of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year's meeting is the first truly global meeting,&quot; says George Saitoti, Kenya's vice president and minister of finance. &quot;For the first time in history, there is no demarcation between East and West. What that means is that the focus is now being put on the incoming states. If Africa is not careful, it is going to be marginalized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMF projections show that Africa will continue to lag behind other regions of the developing world, due to the effects of drought, low commodity prices, and sluggish world demand for its products. Despite more than ten years of painful structural adjustment designed to reform African economies, World Bank President Lewis Preston concedes that Africa will be &quot;the only region of the world where poverty is projected to increase by the turn of the century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the prospects for increased aid to support the poorer countries of sub-Saharan Africa are growing increasingly dim. IMF officials say that the overall level of development aid by the bank and the fund will rise over the next few years, as a result of the new programs in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. But the officials say that it is &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that aid levels for Africa will rise in real terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more ominous, in Africa's view, is the decreasing support by the donor countries for concessional aid -- money loaned at low interest rates with long repayment schedules. World Bank and IMF officials say that they will not neglect Africa, but they face difficulties in maintaining concessional aid at current levels, given the increasing reluctance by major donors to increase funding for the two institutions. The IMF's concessional lending facility, known as ESAF, is due to expire in November 1993, and increased funding for the fund as a whole continues to be held up by the United States. Washington also is among the many donors that have not yet approved funding for IDA-10, the next three-year replenishment of the World Bank's concessional lending fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a communique before the annual meeting, the G-24 group of developing countries, led by chairman Abubakar Alhaji of Nigeria, called attention to the special needs of sub-Saharan Africa. &quot;Additional resource flows to the low-income and lower middle-income sub-Saharan countries need to be much larger in volume and must continue to be on highly concessional terms,&quot; said the G-24, &quot;given the widespread poverty, low levels of saving and investment, excruciating debt service burden, and recently, the severe drought and famine problems with which these countries have had to grapple.&quot; The G-24 group added that increased concessional aid will be essential for the poorer countries in Africa to maintain progress on economic reforms.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has called for a new diplomatic initiative to salvage a West African peace plan for Liberia. An outbreak of fighting that ended a 20-month-long truce has threatened implementation of the plan, which calls for internationally supervised elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a visit here in early September, Carter asked United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to send a small observer mission, unarmed and numbering no more than 20 people, to help get the peace process back on track. The observers, led by a respected international figure, could reassure contending parties during the critical pre-election period, Carter said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest fighting was started by the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (Ulimo) which in August inflicted substantial casualties on the country's largest armed group, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), led by Charles Taylor. Ulimo is made up of elements from the old Liberian national army of former President Samuel K. Doe, whose overthrow Taylor sought when he launched the war nearly three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting was halted in late 1990 by the intervention of a West African peacekeeping force, known as Ecomog. Since then, Liberia has been a divided nation, with an interim government administering the capital Monrovia, under Ecomog protection, and Taylor controlling most of the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ulimo appeared on the scene about six months after Ecomog enforced the truce, staging raids on NPFL positions from bases inside neighboring Sierra Leone. A primary Ulimo aim appeared to be revenge for the casualties Taylor's forces inflicted on Doe's troops during the initial conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently, Ulimo had little impact on the situation. &quot;People did not take us seriously,&quot; says Joseph Taybior, the group's secretary-general and one of its founders. &quot;But we are proving that we are a very determined organization and we are capable of liberating our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ulimo's offensive, begun in August, has driven the NPFL out of long-held positions in the southwest of the country. The objective, Ulimo says, is to force Taylor to comply with the peace plan and disarm his soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor has accused Ecomog of arming Ulimo and says the interim government is giving the insurgency quiet support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ulimo action is the first serious challenge Taylor has faced since Ecomog forced his troops out of suburbs around the capital and imposed the cease-fire in 1990. The West African intervention blocked NPFL's advance towards Doe's headquarters, allowing a splinter rebel faction, led by former Taylor aide Prince Johnson, to get there first.  Johnson's men captured Doe, then tortured and killed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor nurses a deep distrust for Ecomog, saying it is a Nigerian-inspired effort to keep him from becoming president of Liberia. As West African leaders have groped for negotiated solutions, Taylor has resisted, agreeing to proposed peace measures only when pressured strongly by those he regards as friends, such as the government of neighboring Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An accord signed over a year ago, in the Ivorian capital Yamoussoukro, binds all the Liberian parties to accept West African-supervised elections, tentatively scheduled for November 30. The latest fighting, and signs of heightened tensions between Taylor and Ecomog, appears to have set back that timetable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early September, the NPFL detained over 500 West African peacekeepers, seizing their weapons and vehicles. When Carter arrived in the country, he demanded their release as a condition for meeting Taylor. A contingent of about 300 was freed, but the remaining 200 were held for another ten days before being returned to Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor denies that he was using the soldiers as a shield against attack. &quot;We are not terrorists and we do not hold hostages,&quot; he said in a radio broadcast. He said the soldiers' weapons were seized because he feared that the Ecomog soldiers would hand over the sophisticated arms to Ulimo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the peace accord, Ecomog was to deploy its forces throughout Liberia, and all armed factions, including the NPFL, promised to disarm and place their combatants in camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not here to conquer ground,&quot; says Major General Ishaya Bakut of Nigeria, who is field commander of the peacekeeping force. &quot;We're here to conquer the minds of the people, to disarm and encamp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Ecomog deployment has faced repeated delays and Ecomog forces have been denied free movement in Taylor-controlled territory.  In May, the NPFL killed six Senegalese soldiers sent by Ecomog to the north when they refused to surrender their heavy artillery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very embarrassing for us as Liberians,&quot; says Lamini Waritay, information minister for the interim government, headed by President Amos Sawyer. &quot;This is an excellent opportunity for the sub-region to tackle the problems of the sub-region. But Mr. Taylor and the NPFL have taken it upon themselves to embark on a systematic program of discrediting Ecomog,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are taken as a warring faction and not as a peacekeeper,&quot; says Lt.  Col. Ajyei Mensah, a Ghanaian staff officer at Ecomog headquarters. &quot;Any time Ecomog personnel are moving to Charles Taylor's area, the peacekeepers are escorted by the NPFL.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPFL has organized demonstrations against the West African presence. And, according to informed observers, merchants in several areas have been prohibited from selling food to the soldiers, and residents are urged not to house them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a peacekeeper, you have to exercise restraint to avoid any shootout,&quot; said Col. Alex Ackumbo, commanding officer of Nigeria's Eighth Battalion. &quot;That is what we are doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's civil war made refugees of over half the country's 2.6 million people. Although many Liberians who fled the country have been returning, the latest fighting has created as many as 100,000 new refugees, relief workers say, including people from Sierra Leone as well as from Liberia. Poor roads in the border areas make it difficult to get food to those who have fled their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who are hungry enough and strong enough journey to Monrovia, where the population has more than doubled to one million since 1990. Another 30,000 refugees and homeless people have flooded the capital in the weeks since the Ulimo offensive began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Eskayhadi, refugee chairman at the Congo Town refugee camp outside Monrovia says he and hundreds of others walked more than a week to reach the capital. &quot;We are suffering a lot from the NPFL soldiers,&quot; Eskayhadi says. &quot;The commandos take all our belongings. We only arrived here with one shirt, one trousers.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations by Karen Gellen * Africa News Service One year after a United Nations-negotiated cease-fire in Western Sahara, the peace process appears to be unraveling, prompting concerns that fighting will resume. The world body's plan to supervise a referendum in the former Spanish colony is far behind schedule, with no sign of an agreement on voting procedures between the Saharan independence movement, known as the Polisario Front, and Morocco, which claims the territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meetings held here in mid-September between the UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the two rival parties to the peace pact have reflected the increased tensions. &quot;We're back to square one,&quot; says Bachir Mustafa Sayed, chief negotiator for Polisario. The Saharan official says the United Nations &quot;did not fully commit itself to its own plan&quot; and is allowing Morocco to scuttle the accord. Those charges were punctuated September 22 with a warning from the movement's top leader, Mohamed Abdelaziz, that Morocco's stand &quot;conjures up the specter of a return of the war.&quot; Moroccan Foreign Minister Abdellatif Filali denies the charge, saying that Polisario is to blame for the stalemate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immediate dispute is over Rabat's intention to include the Western Sahara in nationwide Moroccan local elections scheduled for this fall. The Saharan group says the vote is meant to pre-empt the referendum on the territory's future that is central to the UN plan. In a letter sent to world leaders, Abdelaziz argued that the Moroccan vote &quot;can have no other objective than the pure and simple burial of the peace plan.&quot; He appealed for international pressure to ensure Morocco's cooperation in the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day earlier, Morocco's Filali, told the General Assembly that Morocco has cooperated with the UN team in Western Sahara. He expressed hope that &quot;realism will prevail over obstructionist tactics&quot; employed by the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To support his point on Moroccan compliance, Filali cited a report on the UN's Western Sahara operation issued by the secretary-general in mid-August. Although the United Nations blames Morocco for most of the cease-fire violations recorded by monitors stationed in the territory, the report appears to support voter eligibility criteria introduced by Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the peace plan negotiated last year by Boutros-Ghali's predecessor, Javier Perez de Cuellar, Saharans are to be given a choice between independence and integration into Morocco. The conflict over how the voter roll will be determined has been the main obstacle to the holding of the referendum, originally scheduled for last January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morocco has been trucking large numbers of its citizens into the former Spanish colony, which it has occupied since 1975, in preparation for the UN-supervised polling. The 120,000 new residents are legitimate voters, says Rabat, because they come from Saharan families that have migrated into Morocco over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polisario says the original UN plan, agreed to by both parties, specifies that only the families and descendants of the 74,000 or so Saharans counted in a 1974 Spanish colonial census will be eligible to vote. But the front's UN negotiator concedes that Perez de Cuellar, during the final days of his tenure, had &quot;opened the door&quot; to Morocco's importation of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an annex to the agreement, says Bachir Sayed, the former secretary-general expanded the criteria for eligibility to include anyone who can claim Saharan lineage. That approach, Sayed argues, removes Saharan nationality from &quot;time and space,&quot; and enables Morocco to cull voters from the entire Mahgreb region.  Sayed says that in his September talks with Boutros-Ghali, the secretary-general told him the UN has &quot;no teeth&quot; with which to enforce Moroccan compliance with other aspects of the peace plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, Polisario has been supported by the Organization of African Unity, and Western Sahara was admitted to the continent-wide organization in 1984, over Morocco's objections. But the Saharan issue appears low on the agenda African countries have brought to the current UN session. The stalled peace operation in Western Sahara received only a bare mention, for example, from the foreign ministers of Angola and Zimbabwe -- countries that have been strong Polisario allies -- when they addressed the General Assembly on its opening day. And Morocco currently sits on the 15-member Security Council, a position that gives Rabat added clout in the UN's political horse trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a counterpoint to the UN talks, Morocco has welcomed with fanfare a group of high-level defectors from Polisario. Eight former officials of the front appeared September 15 at a Rabat press conference, where they declared the independence movement dead. The session was chaired by Brahim Hakim, who served as the Saharan foreign minister for a decade before being replaced in that post in 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group said Polisario has run out of weapons, allies and popular support. According to one of the movement's founders, Salek Fadili, former Polisario backers including Algeria and Cuba, are no longer able to provide aid. &quot;Cuba is in distress, shipwrecked, and Polisario is foundering along.&quot; He said Cuba has given Polisario no aid since 1991, except for educating Saharan students. One participant in the press conference, Fadel Maa el-Ainine, had been Polisario's military attache in Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight defectors echoed long-standing Moroccan claims that tens of thousands of Saharan refugees living in camps just across the Algerian border were being held against their will by Polisario. Mohamed Takillah, who said he had been security chief for the camps, told reporters that the refugees &quot;want to see trucks coming to take them home, to the kingdom of Morocco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked at the UN to comment on the defectors' claims, Bashir Sayed denied Polisario had been receiving weapons from Cuba and disputed a claim by Fadili that the guerrillas were nearly out of fuel, tires, batteries and spare parts. He said Polisario retains its ability to fight again if a collapse of the UN plan makes armed struggle necessary. But the front understands that it &quot;cannot defeat Morocco militarily,&quot; Sayed said. For us, he said, &quot;the political solution is an imperative.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now that months of mounting suffering in Somalia has pierced the world's consciousness, concern for another crisis in the region is increasing among international relief officials and observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War in Sudan, between the Islamic fundamentalist-led government and rebels fighting for autonomy for the largely Christian and animist south, is raising the likelihood of mass starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm deeply worried about the fate of the people of southern Sudan,&quot; U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Herman J. Cohen said at a Senate hearing on September 23. Cohen said he is &quot;very pessimistic&quot; about the prospects for a solution to the civil war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan, Africa's largest country with a land mass about the size of the United States east of the Mississippi River, has a population exceeding 25 million -- the fifth largest on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the current conflict erupted in 1983, several hundred thousand people have died from the almost continuous famine that has accompanied the fighting. With the war intensifying, some 3.7 million people are in need of urgent aid, United Nations officials believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the worst affected are the 300,000 inhabitants of Juba, the south's largest town, which is controlled by government troops but surrounded by an aggressive rebel army. In recent months, relief flights to Juba have been suspended due to the fighting. But the most immediate threat Juba residents are facing, according to eyewitness accounts, is from increasingly edgy government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The local people are suffering greatly at the hands of the army and the security police,&quot; says Sister Nancy Lyons, a Maryknoll nun who was working in Juba until she and other foreigners were expelled in August. &quot;Many, many men from the town have been arrested, many have been tortured and executed,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 22, the State Department announced that a Sudanese employee of the U.S. Agency for International Development was executed in Juba after being convicted of treason by a military tribunal. Another Sudanese national who worked for the U.S. government and two more who worked for other international organizations may have suffered the same fate, U.S. officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviewed during a visit to Washington, Lyons and Marilyn Norris, another Maryknoll sister, said they thought they were forced to leave because the government wants no witnesses to the &quot;horror&quot; that is taking place. Amnesty International says government forces recently executed at least 300 unarmed civilians and prisoners in Juba and arrested hundreds more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current crackdown in Juba began after several major assaults on the town by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in July. Until that time, government forces defending Juba included many southerners, who are easily distinguishable from lighter-skinned northerners. The Maryknoll sisters say that after the attacks, southerners were removed -- with many arrested and apparently executed -- because of suspicions they were SPLA sympathizers or supporters. Most residents of Juba are supportive of the SPLA, the sisters say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local people told the Maryknolls that many of the replacements for the southerners are Iranian. U.S. officials believe Iran has been supplying the Sudanese government with arms and training but say there is no confirmation that Iranian troups have joined the fighting in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan's problems, like Somalia's, stem partly from superpower rivalries during the Cold War. The countries of what is called the Horn of Africa, which also includes Ethiopia and Djibouti, were considered strategic by both the United States and the Soviet Union. Competition for influence led to shifting alliances, to support for dictators who dismantled local administrations and social structures, and to massive arms buildups that are fueling the power struggles in Somalia and Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan, the top recipient of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa during the post-World War II era, was led during much of the period by Gaafar Muhammad Numeiri, an authoritarian military ruler who seized power in 1969. Numeiri survived more than a dozen efforts to oust him before losing control to rival soldiers in 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, Numeiri reached an accommodation with the rebellious south, granting a measure of autonomy. But in the early 1980s, in an attempt to shore up his shaky political base, he adopted an increasingly strict version of Islam. He finally imposed Sharia, or Islamic law, on the entire nation, sparking resumption of war with the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although peace talks began earlier this year, under the sponsorship of Nigeria and the Organization of African Unity, the current Sudanese regime, led by General Omar al-Bashir, has pressed the effort to Islamicize the country and stepped up measures to defeat the SPLA militarily. The government offensive has weakened the SPLA, which has also suffered an internal split.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's &quot;holy war&quot; has been expanded to non-southerners, including the Nuba peoples in the country's mountainous central region. Many of the one million Nuba are Muslim, but the SPLA has recruited among them and has operated from bases in the southern Nuba mountains, adjacent to the SPLA stronghold in southern Sudan. In response, the government has waged what the human rights group Africa Watch has termed a &quot;campaign of horrifying dimensions&quot; against the Nuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worsening situation in Sudan remains largely unreported, in part because of the government's successful efforts to fend off bad publicity.  Access to Sudan by journalists and other outsiders in severely limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prompted by rising concern among aid workers and the U.S. government, Jan Eliasson, the United Nations undersecretary for humanitarian affairs, traveled to Sudan in early September. In the capital, Khartoum, he sought government consent to resume relief flights to the south. After arranging a brief cease-fire with the SPLA, Eliasson also stopped in Juba to assess aid requirements. Following the trip, which included talks in Nairobi, Kenya, with both factions of the SPLA, Eliasson announced agreement on restarting the airlift of food to Juba and 20 other southern sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, there are indications that long-delayed peace talks may resume. Nigerian mediators have visited Khartoum to discuss holding a second round of peace talks between the government and the rebels in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiny Rowland, head of Lonrho, a British conglomerate with extensive interests throughout Africa, held talks in September with SPLA leader John Garang and with al-Bashir. Rowland, who has also been a central player in the Mozambique peace talks, told the Financial Times of London that a cease-fire agreement in Sudan will be reached &quot;very soon.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

President Francois Mitterand, who recently underwent prostate cancer surgery, was advised by his doctors not to travel to Gabon, site of this year's meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabon's President Omar Bongo was reported to be unhappy that Mitterand failed to attend. A low turnout of heads of state was attributed to the French leader's absence. Only 14 heads of state attended the summit, the lowest number since 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy took part in the conference in place of Mitterand. He announced a debt conversion plan for Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, and Cote d'Ivoire worth $ 824 million. The four are considered middle-income countries and have not qualified previously for concessions on their debts. Under the proposed plan, new investment by the four countries in infrastructure development will be deducted from their debt to France. French officials say the program is an attempt to alleviate the economic burdens of the former French territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the summit, almost 200 opposition supporters staged a sit-in outside the General De Gaulle military base in Libreville, the Gabonese capital, to protest the summit. The demonstrators, organized by the Coordination of the Democratic Opposition, said that Bongo's failure to lead the country toward democracy in his 25 years of office made him unfit to host the summit. Protesters demanded that Bongo's &quot;imperialist rule&quot; come to an end. Bongo gave in to demands for multiparty elections in 1990, but the opposition agreed to let him complete his current term, which ends in 1994.</SPAN></P>

Troops loyal to President Said Mohamed Djohar managed to regain control within a few hours of the initial attack on September 26, removing rebels from the radio station in Moroni, capital of the Indian Ocean archipelago, which has a history of political instability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to government officials, two of the alleged coup organizers are sons of former President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane, who was shot dead in November 1989, during an argument with Bob Denard, a French mercenary. Denard came to the islands in 1978, with a troop of 30 &quot;dogs of war&quot; to reinstate Abdallah, who had been deposed in a coup three years earlier. Denard served as commander of Abdallah's presidential guard until the shooting, when the mercenary seized personal control of the islands. He surrendered after dozens of French paratroopers landed in Comoros to oust him from authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third suspected leader of last month's attempt to overthrow Djohar is a former member of Abdallah's presidential guard known as &quot;Captain Combo,&quot; who is linked to Denard, now exiled in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djohar, former president of the Supreme Court, was named acting head of state following the death of Abdallah and was elected president in an uncontested race in 1990. In August of the same year, Djohar escaped one coup attempt, and in 1991 he foiled an attempt by opposition leaders to have the Supreme Court impeach him on the grounds of his alleged senility. The latest uprising follows protests by Comorian dissidents, who claim that their current government is corrupt and that Djohar is a dictator. The officers who tried to seize control have made no official statements about the coup attempt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is on-again, off-again for the face-off between Zaire's new prime minister, Etienne Tshisekedi, and the entrenched president, Mobutu Sese Seko.  After sending troops to surround the central bank in the capital, Kinshasa -- a move to thwart Tshisekedi's attempt to replace the bank chief, a Mobutu loyalist -- Mobutu issued a call for &quot;national reconciliation&quot; earlier this month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president dispatched the soldiers after Tshisekedi charged the bank's governor with responsibility for the disappearance of $ 5 million from the national treasury during the last week of September. Foreign donors have said they will not resume any aid flows to Zaire until they are assured that Mobutu's access to the national funds has been blocked. The 62-year-old leader is believed to have diverted many millions -- perhaps even billions -- of dollars for his personal use and to reward loyalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshisekedi, who was named prime minister by a national pro-democracy conference in August, is trying to end Zaire's economic downslide and put the country on a recovery footing. National elections to chose a new government are planned, but no date has been set. Mobutu wants the voting to take place within the next six to twelve months, while Tshisekedi and the national conference say at least 18 months are required to prepare for fully free balloting.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenneth Kaunda, who served for 27 years as president of Zambia until his defeat in last October's election, resigned this month as head of the United National Independence Party (UNIP). The party, meeting in a special congress, chose Kebby Musokotwane to replace the former president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musokotwane, who was the party's secretary-general, was Kaunda's choice as his successor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musokotwane garnered 4,590 votes compared to his closest competitor, Godwin Yoran Mumba, who only received 106 votes. Prior to the congress, the race between Musokotwane and Mumba had led to violent disputes between groups vying for power within the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda long has been urged by friends at home and abroad to leave party politics and take on the role of &quot;senior statesman.&quot; The leader of UNIP since it was established in 1959 during the struggle for Zambian independence, Kaunda was recently named &quot;founding father of the nation.&quot; His rule ended in October, when he lost a presidential election to Frederick Chiluba, leader of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a farewell address at the party congress, Kaunda criticized President Chiluba's privatization program, charging that the new leader is allowing foreigners to make important policy decisions. Kaunda also criticized the country's adoption of multiparty democracy, which he accepted last year under domestic and international pressure. The former president said that rising prices of fertilizer and seeds under the Chiluba government fail to take into account the needs of workers and peasants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his acceptance speech, Musokotwane told the members of congress that under the new UNIP leadership, the party would fight to regain control of the Southern African country. Musokotwane stated that he is now rededicating himself to the goals of the party and to serving the people of Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Floribert Chebeya Bahizire of Zaire was recently named one of the four recipients of the 1992 Reebok Human Rights Award. The five-year-old award recognizes the achievements of individuals under the age of 30 who advance the cause of human rights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the strong army rule of President Mobutu Sese Seko, stories of human rights violations have become commonplace. Reports of physical punishment, arbitrary detentions, harassment, death threats and kidnappings are frequent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1983 when he was 18 years old, Chebeya organized a group of students to protest human rights abuses. Calling themselves Voice for the Voiceless (VCV), the students published and distributed a bulletin detailing human rights violations, working under dangerous circumstances with no budget.  VCV functioned as an illegal underground organization until April 1990, when Mobutu, pressured by growing democracy movements, began to allow multiparty democracy movements to function legally. Chebeya continues to serve as the president of VCV though he receives regular threats on his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the Reebok Foundation, Paul Fireman, CEO of Reebok International Limited, will present Chebeya with an award of $ 25,000 to donate to the human rights organization of his choice. This year's awards will be presented in a ceremony in Boston on October 9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government of Cote d'Ivoire has again rejected a call by the International Monetary Fund for sharp reductions in salary outlays for civil servants. &quot;Cote d'Ivoire cannot accept a major reduction in civil service spending,&quot; Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara said during an unprecedented four-hour, live, question-and-answer session on national television October 1.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended a $ 120-million stand-by credit agreement with the West African nation in June, saying the government had failed to meet budgetary targets. The IMF wants Ivorian authorities to cut the government payroll, increase tax revenue, and eliminate price supports for coffee and cocoa, the country's principle exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the government has been unwilling to take these unpopular steps, despite pressure from the fund and from foreign aid donors. Civil servants and farmers form the core of support for the ruling party, headed by long-serving President Felix Houphouet-Boigny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political tensions rose to record heights earlier this year with the jailing of leading opposition figures, including Laurent Gbagbo, head of the largest opposition party. But since Houphouet-Boigny returned to the country last July after a five-month absence and ordered the release of Gbagbo and 74 others, the atmosphere has quieted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gbagbo is continuing his attacks on the government, accusing Ouattara of mismanagement and calling for an emphasis on industrialization as an alternative to dependence on cash crop sales.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government of Cameroon has closed the national voters' register amidst protests from opposition party members who were barred from registering. Some opposition supporters missed the annual April 1 deadline for registration because of a boycott against parliamentary elections in March. When President Paul Biya decided to move national elections originally scheduled for next April to October, many party members discovered that they would be unable to vote in Cameroon's first multiparty elections in almost 30 years. Despite continuing protests, Biya has refused to reopen the voting register.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight candidates are standing for the upcoming presidential ballot including incumbent Biya and his major rival, John Fru Ndi, head of the Social Democratic Front (SDF). According to a recently released survey, Ndi is leading Biya by 20 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the campaigns officially began on September 26, there have been three reported attacks on opposition leaders. Progressive Movement leader Jean-Jacques Ekindi survived an assassination attempt on October 4, when Biya supporters threw a Molatov cocktail into his car. Members of the National Democratic Union also reported a similar attack in Ngaoundal, 300 miles north of the capital. Last week, opposition sources reported that eight members of the SDF were hospitalized with cuts and head wounds after a clash with Biya supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rising tensions were also evident in a recent allegation made by Gregoire Owana, deputy general secretary of the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement. Owona told Radio Cameroon that if Ndi's SDF wins the October 11 vote, the victors would execute top officials of the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As violence in the central African country has mounted, national security chief and Biya campaign adviser John Fochive ordered all Cameroon embassies to stop issuing visas to international observers. Some opposition supporters, who accuse Fochive of suppressing a pro-democracy student movement last year, fear that his control of the police could lead to massive vote-rigging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SDF supporters also are concerned that France might back a military coup to prevent Ndi from winning the election, in order to maintain their influence in the country. Ndi has described France's interest in Cameroon as &quot;the genuine fear of one whose umbilical cord may be cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">814 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the 600 outside observers for the presidential and parliamentary elections in Angola was a 39-member delegation organized by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, a non-partisan non-profit organization based in Washington, DC. Funding for the project was provided by the United States Agency for International Development (AID). The delegation was made up of U.S.  citizens, plus nationals of Brazil, Costa Rica, the Netherlands, Nigeria and Surinam. Here are excerpts from the delegation's statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation is impressed that over ninety percent of the estimated eligible electorate of Angola registered to vote, and that a very large percent of these registrants apparently voted.  Although different members of the delegation observed a range of problematic conditions and recurrent difficulties, along with isolated lapses of adherence to regulations, the delegates agree that with respect to the primary concerns of the IFES mission the Angolan elections of September 29-30 were admirably conducted.  Furthermore, delegation members were struck by the enthusiasm, resolve, and persistence of the Angolan voters, who often had to stand in very long lines for up to twelve hours or more in order to vote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the more serious difficulties encountered were many instances of late opening of polling places, and related instances of unruliness at the entrance to voting sites.  While perhaps the largest segment of voters used without difficulty the complicated balloting materials that were officially mandated, a substantial number of voters seemed confused by them.  The relatively large number of null and blank ballot papers recorded appear to be indicative of this situation .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballot counting at voting sites and provincial tabulating centers were observed to have proceeded as stipulated by the electoral code.  Unanticipated delay and complications sometimes arose in connection with the collection and transport of results to provincial capitals.  Transmission of vote totals and tally of results at the national tabulating site in Luanda took place slowly, and this gave rise to widespread public concern and anxiety.  The delegation's statement, however, cannot fully take into account this last phase of the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFES delegation believes that the achievements of these elections are remarkable in light of the relatively short period of time that passed between the commencement of official election preparations and the actual event.  The delegation is also conscious that this success was achieved in the extremely tense circumstances arising from the recent Angolan civil war, notably the fierce competitive relationship between the two major Angolan political parties, many of whose more active adherents have been armed and organized combatants.  In these settings particularly, the generally peaceful and effective administration of the Angolan elections represents a milestone in the history of Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conclusion, the IFES delegation wishes to stress the strict limitations of our statement, which does not bear upon the conduct of the electoral campaign proceeding the election, nor on the reception by various segments of the Angolan people of the outcome.  The delegation also has not considered issues underlying the entire electoral process such as the possible impact of the uncompleted military demobilization on the emergent parties or, more importantly, on the general attitude of the Angolan people and the degree of their willingness to participate.  Nor does this statement address other factors such as access to the media in Angola, external assistance, and related controversies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bearing in mind the limits of our terms of reference, and also the limits of our opportunities to observe, from what the delegation observed the consensus of the IFES international delegation of election observers was that the Angolan elections of September 29-30, 1992 constituted a proper and effective application of the mechanism of elective choice of political representatives, and the delegation congratulates the entire country.  This statement does not presume to speak for the Angolan people.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There's no mistaking that an election is going on in Angola. Baseball caps, key chains, posters, umbrellas, flags and banners of all sizes, motorized billboards that rotate to reveal different messages and tee shirts in a variety of styles urge people to support a party or vote for one of 13 candidates running for president. It's almost like being on Main Street, USA preparing for the November elections. All the trappings of a Madison Avenue PR firm are here -- from miniature blimps flying in the sky to campaign videos. Buildings, homes, statues and buses are plastered with bumper stickers and posters. There is a sense that this election is special, despite the rumblings that the potential for violence is high. The people are ready for this election and the excitement clearly shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen parties have fielded candidates for the parliament and/or president. The deluge of paper is mind-boggling. Several times a day vehicles, drive through neighborhoods showering streets and yards with hundreds of brochures and flyers extolling the virtues of a candidates or party. The streets of Luanda are littered with refuse from the campaigns.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the percentage of the population owning television sets is small, video productions have been an important part of preparing citizens for the election. To encourage the get out and vote effort, the National Electoral Council recorded an official song and video. Strongly reminiscent of the &quot;We are the World&quot; campaign during the Ethiopian famine of 1985, the video features Angolans in a studio wearing Vote Angola tee shirts, solos by various singers including a Stevie Wonder look-alike complete with dark sunglasses and Stevie's characteristic movement, and an ending that features hands waving in the air.  Mixed in with the studio scenes are shots of Angolans getting voter registration cards, street scenes, and shots of people flashing the &quot;V&quot; for vote signal. The video and accompanying song are played frequently on the radio and during television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolan electoral law gives all parties and candidates access to twenty minutes of public radio daily and ten minutes of public television time daily. The videos for various political parties exhibited a wide range of creative thinking and production capability. The video for Daniel Chipenda, the candidate of the National Democratic Party of Angola (PNDA), opens with an electoral rap. Other videos feature panoramic views of a pastoral Angola, arty shots of the countryside, and candid photos of people. In sharp contrasts to parties with the financial capability to produce a dramatic video were simple presentations that featured a candidate in a studio reading a prepared statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Saturday preceding the election, the two main parties stage big events in the capital. Unita holds a historic rally in May 1st Square -- the first time a major political gathering by the opposition was permitted in Luanda. Thousands gather, most wearing Unita tee shirts, many women wearing cloth in a traditional African print featuring a likeness of Jonas Savimbi, the party leader and a presidential candidate. In a minor incident the crowd shows its disdain for the ruling party and the police. When a jeep filled with police tries to penetrate the outer edge of the rally, the crowd quickly blocks access to the square chanting for the police to go away. Prudently the vehicle backs away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPLA event is more like a festival. Tents line the perimeter of the grounds, where people grill chicken, mill around stands dispensing sodas and beer, and take advantage of giveaways of election paraphernalia. A band plays popular tunes interspersed with songs praising the virtues of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, September 27 four teams from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems delegation leave for the airport at 6 a.m. to travel to outlying provinces. Four additional teams head for other provinces by car. We fly on an Army C-130 plane with our cargo of sleeping bags, a supply of bottled water, first aid kits and food. I am assigned to Huila, where 509,000 people have registered to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are dropped off literally in the middle of a runway at the Lubango airport, where the expected United Nations contact person is nowhere in sight.  The C-130 rushes to take off, to avoid confrontations with former Angolan soldiers trying to get back to their home provinces. The demobilized men hang around airports in hopes of hitching a ride, but the U.S. army wants no part of that plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly ordered off the runway by an Angolan soldier, our group takes refuge under the shade of a small tree. There are nine of us, four from the United States and five observers from the European Community (EC) and Canada. A row of MIG fighter jets in varying states of disrepair are neatly parked on the side of the runway. We can see other discarded war equipment, parts of rusting troop carriers,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disabled trucks and jeeps and assorted tanks and weapons nearby. The Canadian remarks that we are looking at perhaps half a billion dollars worth of war equipment. He muses about what that money could have bought if spent on health, education and development projects. Another team member says, &quot;The war was real here,&quot; and the thought sobers all the warm feelings generated by the good times at the rallies and by the cute posters papering Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hotel in Lubango, the provincial capital of Huila, begins to fill with international observers. There is an additional U.S. delegation brought by Unita. There are Somali and Ethiopian observers representing the Organization of African Unity, as well as several Europeans. Some observers seem more serious and better prepared than others. My group secretly coins a phrase, &quot;electoral tourists,&quot; to describe the folks who seem to be along just for the ride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We visit the provincial governor's office, a safeguard in case there is trouble. We want him to know who and where we are. We visit the provincial election headquarters and make a few pre-election stops to polling sites.  Everyone is busy preparing for the vote, scrubbing floors, rearranging furniture, setting up tables to get ready. At the UN headquarters -- which is the home-base for United Nations Angola Unification Mission (Unavem), United Nations development Program (UNDP), United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) and several other UN programs -- there is hustle and bustle. All available aircraft, jeeps and vans are in use, delivering remaining voting kits and scheduling travel for observers across the province. A helicopter crash the day before does not dampen the determination to pursue the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An expectant air surrounds the opening of the polling sites on September 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My team observes the opening of a site in the middle of town at the cultural, or cultural center. By 6:45 a.m., all is ready. The site has two tables, each with 1200 ballots -- 1000 for the expected number of voters plus 200 extra. The ballots are color coded, pink to cast a vote for president and blue for members of parliament. In the parliamentary poll voters cast one vote for the party of their choice, and 233 representatives are allocated according to the percentage of the vote each party receives. At each polling site there is a president, secretary and three scrutineers who make up the election's official staff. Each party and each presidential candidate also has the right to appoint official observers to monitor the polling sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are twelve additional people in this cultura as observers, representing five parties. With considerable ceremony, the two presidents -- one for each voting table -- open the pink and the blue metal ballot boxes, present them for inspection to verify that they are empty, and proceed to lock them under the careful scrutiny of all present. This process, along with the accompanying speeches, takes some time. Afterward, the officials get to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside, 500 or 600 people are in line and the crowd is restless. In an attempt to facilitate the process, numbers are passed out, but this serves to further frustrate the crowd, as some people who have been in standing line more than an hour realize there are already over 500 people ahead of them and it's only 7 o'clock in the morning!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am puzzled because there seem to be so few women in line. A quick count revealed about 30 women out of the 500 or so people in front of the cultura. I ask one of the female &quot;scrutineers&quot; why there are so few women. She points out to me that most women and men have formed separate lines, according to an Angolan custom that separates the sexes in public places. The line for women was a single line formed neatly around the side and back of the building. I walk to a side street and indeed there is a large crowd of women patiently waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voting proceeds slowly. Even in this well-organized site, some efficiency is lost because of the problem of illiteracy. Approximately 58% of Angola's people cannot read or write. Anticipating the problem, the electoral law permits marking the ballots with an &quot;X&quot; or placing a thumb print next to the desired candidate or party. The pink ballot for president lists the names of the candidates and has pictures next to the names. The blue ballot for parliament has the name of the party, the party flag in full color, and the party symbol. Still it is apparent that many people are having great difficulty in figuring out the ballot. Because there is so much information on each ballot, the printing, photos and symbols are small, causing special difficulty for people with vision problems. The law failed to provide for assistance at the polling sites, and the party observers struggled to find out ways to help people figure out the ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people were literally paralyzed by the process of voting, too nervous to mark the ballot until they could calm down. Others clearly relished the experience, proudly casting their vote. All seem to be dressed in their finest garb -- everything from party dresses to men in fur caps and heavy wool jackets, despite the warmth of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am disturbed by the large number of people with handicaps who come to vote. After several hours of observing, I estimate that a third of the voters are missing one or more limbs, have body disfigurations, are on crutches or in wheelchairs, or walk with a limp. The human toll of war fuels a growing sense of the futility of battle. Another member of the IFES delegation tells me that her polling site lets all the disabled people vote first and it takes hours. The ravages of war ... .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At noon, less than 400 people have completed voting and committee members decide to set up a second voting &quot;booth&quot; to speed up the process. They quickly find a long table and set up a barrier in the middle for privacy; thus, they enable privacy for six people instead of four at a time to vote. I am continually impressed by the commitment and the dedication that both the election committee and the party observers exhibit. At the end, they speak of themselves as a team -- and throughout the three days of voting and counting they worked that way. There was none of the partisan bickering and mistrust that was predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the afternoon, we travel out into the province. About 18 miles (30 kilometers) away, at Chibia, 43 tables have been set up for the 43,458 people registered there. En route we stop at several rural voting sites. Everywhere there are hundreds of people in line, many of whom have waited for hours in the sun. The spirit of the crowds is high and all are determined to vote. At one site, elderly men get stones for makeshift seats and squat on them while they wait. At another, the women seat themselves on the ground in a separate group from the men standing in line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Chibia, voters at one site wait under a stand of shade trees across the street from a community center where voting taking place. The process in many sites is excruciatingly slow, because the act of voting is carried out so ceremoniously. It is after 4:00 in the afternoon and some rural sites have voted less than 300 people. There is no electricity at many of these sites, so voting will probably end at sunset. I wonder if people who have waited so long will return the second day to try again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 6 p.m., we return to Lubango and revisit several polling stations.  The lines are shorter now, but a significant number of people still wait. At a site in a school building, the electoral committee in one room decides to close the polls 45 minutes early because there is no light. The committee has been provided with two lanterns but no oil. In the next room, voting continues because the lanterns there have fuel. The crowd is unhappy with the decision to end the voting for the day, and there is angry shouting and some pushing and shoving, but order is maintained. The committee goes through the long process of officially closing the polls for the day. I remember that I have a flashlight, and the work continues. Each step is witnessed by the party and candidate observers and they sign various documents to attest the accuracy and veracity of the reports before ballot boxes are locked. Committee members prepare to spend the night in the school building with the boxes to ensure ballot security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back at the culture center, there is electricity and the voting goes on until 7 p.m. About 50 people who are still in line when the polls close are told to return the next day. Approximately 800 people have voted at each of the two tables. The ballot boxes are locked with great ceremony and the international observers are asked to witness the sealing of the boxes by signing a form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday morning, the polls reopen at 7 a.m. The IFES delegation officially witnesses the reopening of the ballot boxes. The process moves quicker today, and we decide to visit another province at the suggestion of a UN official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip to Namibe province, where 85,000 people are registered to vote, takes over three hours rather than the two hours we had been told to expect. The narrow, mountainous road winds precariously through high cliffs that look like the Grand Canyon. The provincial capital, Namibe, is a picturesque waterfront town with pastel colored houses and delightfully landscaped squares. At the provincial election council we are told that most of the voting has been completed, though it is still early afternoon. We do not observe any people waiting in lines and committees are waiting for 7 p.m. to officially close the polls and begin the counting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Lubango once again, the closing of the polls on the second day goes smoothly. There are a few people drifting in to vote up until 7 p.m. Counting was to have begun immediately, but a government order arrives, postponing the tally until the next day. The order cites problems with inadequate lighting or lack of lighting in many sites and the possibility of power outages in the night that could threaten ballot security. The electoral council president is not satisfied with the directive and waits until he receives confirmation of the ruling from the Provincial Election Center -- 90 minutes later. Some sites go ahead with the counting, while others stop for the night once the call comes in. Meals for the poll workers have been provided by a local restaurant.  Although election police are guarding the ballots, one president wolfs down his food and hastily returns across the street to keep an eye on the ballot boxes, &quot;because that is very important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counting begins promptly at 7 a.m. on October 1 at the cultura in Lubango. One group counts the ballots for president, while a second group tallies the assembly votes. The party and presidential observers are prepared to verify and record the votes for themselves. The process is slow, with every ballot viewed by each member of the voting committee and each observer. (Later, one U.S. observer describes an election ballet, where the president physically carried each ballot for the folks to see, often almost pirouetting.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three hours later, only one box for the president has been counted.  The table counting the assembly votes are only two-thirds of the way through their first box. The number of null votes -- incorrectly marked or otherwise invalid -- and blank votes -- ballots folded and inserted in the ballot boxes -- is statistically significant. It is well into the evening before that counting is completed, all ballots are accounted for, and the official report is done. We return to Luanda to await the national vote count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Electoral Council planned for an orderly count as fast as possible. Provincial councils were given dedicated fax lines to transmit results; for those sites where that was not possible, shortwave radio reports were anticipated. The Unavem operation would supplement those efforts with air and ground transport of reports where necessary. Even with all these provisions in place, at the end of the first day of counting only about 12% of the national vote was accounted for. A week after the polls closed, still only 81% of the ballots have been noted officially, giving rise to charges from opposition parties of vote fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official statements from the various observer groups indicate no mass fraud, intimidation or serious voting irregularities, although the slowness of the count was frustrating. Where technology failed, the human spirit thrived and the counting went on with a spirit of determination to complete the process and of compromise to accommodate opposing concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's need for peace and stability is stressed above all else by Angolans I met. Many expressed the view that they were not wedded to one presidential candidate, that the most important thing to support was the end to violence and the meaningless slaughter of people. It is impossible to ignore the consequences of war here, both human and material. Everywhere there are broken down army vehicles, rusted out shells of planes, and abandoned radar equipment. Army barracks no longer in use dot the countryside and children romp in makeshift play equipment fashioned from parts of tanks. A large segment of the population wears army uniforms, perhaps the only clothes they own.  Forgetting the 16 years of civil war will not be easy; there are too many daily reminders. Armed personnel are everywhere, gunshots are common occurrences at night, and it is only with cautious optimism that people say life in Angola is improving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola was once self-sufficient in food.  It has vast oil, diamond and mineral resources.  Its roads and rail lines, though heavily damaged, can provide decent transportion throughout much of the country.  The elements for progress and stability are in place.  After hundreds of years of struggle for freedom and independence, I strongly feel the Angolan people are determined to survive and prosper.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angolans finally got their turn at the ballot box last month, and they turned out in huge numbers. Four centuries of particularly brutal colonization and 16 years of devastating civil war have left the country in shambles and its people eager for a respite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With transport, electricity and communication facilities in short supply, organizing elections in this mostly rural country -- about the size of Texas and California combined -- was a complex task. Despite numerous minor hitches, voting went surprisingly smoothly as candidates from 17 parties vied for the country's top post and seats in the 200-member parliament. But the future for the country is clouded by uncertainty about the plans of Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as Unita.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel leader voiced a protest as soon as preliminary vote counts showed him losing the presidential race to Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the current Angolan president. Savimbi stirred further fears one week after the voting when he suddenly left the Angolan capital, Luanda, for the provincial capital of Huambo. With his lieutenants suggesting that Unita was prepared to turn Angolan into another Somalia, Savimbi seemed to be hunkering down for a possible return to war. Observers say he apparently was unprepared for defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States, which has provided over $ 300 million in covert funding for Unita since 1985, called on Savimbi to accept the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi may have overestimated his backing, largely on an assumption that Angolans are angry about economic mismanagement and corruption in the dos Santos government and the ruling MPLA party. With large oil revenues and huge agricultural capability, Angola is potentially one of the strongest countries in Africa. Its economic woes are seen as only partially the result of the destruction and dislocation caused by war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the balloting, there were other worrisome developments. Both the government and the rebel movement were accused of major violations of the 1991 peace accord, which set the stage for the vote. Unita's refusal to allow free movement in territory under its control and its failure to demobilize the bulk of its army were seen by many outside observers as particularly threatening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unita's control extends over about one-fifth of the country's territory -- in the center around Huambo -- and in that region Savimbi received about four-fifths of the votes. Much of Savimbi's following comes from the Ovimbundu, Angola's largest ethnic group. So any attempted secession by Savimbi could split the country along ethnic lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dos Santos defeated Savimbi in almost all other areas. Voters throughout the country endured long walks and long lines to cast their votes under the gaze of a United Nations monitoring group and about 600 international observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bertie Howard, executive director of Africa News Service, was part of an observer delegation organized by the Washington, DC, based International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES). Her trip journal is a personal look at the election process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's transition from military rule to a democratically elected civilian government hit a snag this month, as allegations of electoral fraud prompted the government to suspend elections. President Ibrahim Babangida's Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) officially put further rounds of voting on hold in response to charges of widespread vote-rigging and misconduct by election officials during initial primaries. The AFRC also ordered the National Electoral Commission (NEC) to conduct a full investigation of the charges and to issue a report of their findings within one week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems began during the first round of voting on August 1, when critics claimed that the election results were falsified. Presidential candidates from both the left-of-center Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the right-of-center National Republican Convention (NRC) charged party officials with instructing presiding officers to award predetermined numbers of votes to favored primary candidates. Following a meeting between the chairman of the NEC and party leaders, both sides agreed to repudiate all results, citing &quot;widespread malpractice.&quot; Vice President Augustus Aikhomu issued a warning that the government would disqualify candidates if the primaries failed again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government officials, promising that the process would be monitored closely, set a new date for the first round of three primaries. The September 12 vote was reported as peaceful with few protests. Five men survived the balloting: Olu Falae and Shehu Musa Yar' Adua from the SDP and Adamu Chiroma, Umaru Shinkafi, and Bamanga Tukur from the NRC, with Falae and Shinkafi leading their respective parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second primary on September 19 was marked by heavy protests. Eight SDP candidates charged their party chairman, Baba Kingibe, with conspiring to advance Yar' Adua as the party's presidential candidate. The other candidates asked for the removal of Kingibe, the dissolution of the SDP national executive council, and the appointment of an administrator for the third and final primary. Despite candidates' threats to boycott the next round, the government refused to intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten of the 12 SDP candidates withdrew from the election in protest.  Yar' Adua and Abel Ubeka, one of the least known candidates, elected to stay in the race, and Yar' Adua swept the September 26 primary, emerging as the party's presidential candidate. On the NRC side, Adamu and Ciroma were scheduled for a run-off in October, since neither candidate managed to receive one-third of the vote from at least 20 out of 30 states, but those results also were disputed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations of fraud gained credibility when NRC party officials admitted to rigging poll results. Officials from the eastern state of Adamawa claimed that they were forced by death threats to add 10,000 votes to Ciroma's tally, which gave him a slight lead over Bamanga Tukur, the candidate who was eliminated. Protesters called on the government to stop the political process and order the NEC to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers of Nigeria's democracy movement have expressed concern about the suspension of the transition to civilian rule. But Nigerian officials say the delay will not affect plans to hand over power to civilian leadership in January 1993. Vice President Aikhomu says the government aims to ensure that the person elected president is cleared of any allegations of corruption or fraud. Officials also say that any candidates found guilty of misconduct will be banned from political activity for 10 years, in accordance with a military decree issued by the government before the primaries began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has been under military rule for 22 of its 32 years of independence from British rule. Following the removal of President Shehu Shagari in 1983, President Babangida assumed control of the country after staging a barracks coup in 1985. Babangida established the two parties, using the American political system as a model, as part of his plan to return the country to civilian rule. National presidential elections are still scheduled for December 5.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first time since independence in 1975, Mozambique faces the prospect of peace. On Oct. 4 the country held its collective breath as President Joaquim Chissano and Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the rebel Renamo movement, signed an agreement to end the war that has taken more than a half-million lives. Although the two men embraced and called each other &quot;dear brother,&quot; implementation of the agreement -- which provides for a cease-fire and multiparty elections -- is likely to be rocky.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pact, signed in Rome, came after two years of tense negotiations mediated by Italy, the Vatican, the United States, France, Britain and Russia.  Agreement was spurred by a killing drought stalking the economically devastated southern African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the cease-fire holds, it should enable a large-scale international relief effort to reach the 3.2 million Mozambicans who the United Nations estimates face imminent starvation. For much of the war, the country's main roads were made impassable by rebel attacks on civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten thousand soldiers from neighboring Zimbabwe have been operating inside Mozambique, guarding the vital Beira railway corridor that has been one of the country's fragile lifelines. The peace accord mandates a withdrawal of the Zimbabwean troops and the formation of a new 30,000-member national army that will be half government forces and half former Renamo rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally formed by Rhodesian intelligence to thwart Mozambican support for the Zimbabwe independence movement, Renamo later was taken under South Africa's wing. The movement destroyed most of the country's infrastructure, including virtually all schools and health facilities in rural areas. The rebel force, also known as the Mozambican National Resistance, has been repeatedly condemned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by international human rights organizations for its brutal tactics, characterized by large-scale massacres and horrific maiming of civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Rome signing ceremony, Renamo's Dhlakama vowed to abide by the outcome of a UN-supervised vote scheduled for October 1993 in Mozambique.  &quot;Power is not important,&quot; he asserted. &quot;If we lose the election we will go into the opposition. We will respect the agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chissano stressed the urgent need for peace in the &quot;devastated country ... with hundreds of thousands of lives at risk&quot; from the drought. The Italian government, which played a principal mediating role in the frequently broken-off talks, announced after the signing that it would soon host an international conference to coordinate aid for Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospects for national reconciliation and economic relief for the population of l5 million remain daunting, however, given the scale of bloodshed and the country's dire poverty. This year the World Bank reported that Mozambique has the lowest per capita gross national product of any nation.  Nevertheless, both parties to the historic accord expressed optimism about rebuilding the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prominent behind-the-scenes role played in the talks by British business figure Roland &quot;Tiny&quot; Rowlands is widely viewed as a sign that international investment will flow to Mozambique if peace takes hold. Chissano, Dhlakama and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who participated in the Rome ceremony, praised Rowlands -- who has extensive interests throughout Southern Africa -- for his efforts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three West African soldiers were killed in a battle on October 3 between Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and a rival rebel group on the outskirts of the capital Monrovia. Several rebel soldiers also were killed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West African commanders say Taylor's forces and rebels from the United Liberation Movement of Democracy for Liberia (Ulimo) are trying to involve them directly in the Liberian conflict. They say Taylor, who claims the West Africans are backing Ulimo, wants to discredit the peacekeeping force. Ulimo seeks West African help in defeating Taylor's forces, these sources say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Benin's President Nicephore Soglo, who heads the Economic Community of West African States that created the peacekeeping force, called Ecomog, has proposed a meeting of Liberia's warring factions. However, the idea has not been endorsed by the region's other heads of state, who have met repeatedly over the past two years to hammer out peace accords among feuding Liberians. According to official sources, these leaders say they want the factions to adhere to agreements previously negotiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor, who controls most of Liberia's economy and countryside, ignored a regional mandate to disarm by August 31 or face sanctions. But he has said he will not give up his weapons until Ulimo stops attacking his troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's interim government, which controls the capital, Monrovia, under the protection of the African peacekeepers, says West African leaders have shown little inclination to enforce their own edicts against Taylor.  Lamini Waritay, interim minister for information, says officials in Monrovia hope for &quot;a more vigorous implementation of the (peace) accords.'' Maj. Gen.  Ishaya Bakut, Ecomog commander, is ending his tour of duty and returning to Nigeria. The interim government hopes his successor will be more forceful with Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have tried to disavow the use of force,&quot; Waritay said in a telephone interview, but if Ecomog decides to take action against the NPFL, &quot;I don't think many people will be opposed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Ecomog's 7,000 soldiers deployed in the Monrovia area have stopped wearing their white peacekeeping helmets, replacing them with combat helmets. Searches of vehicles at roadblocks throughout the capital have been increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ulimo, composed of the remnants of the army of former dictator Samuel K. Doe, who was killed in 1990, launched an offensive against the NPFL in August, saying that only force would make Taylor disarm and demobilize. Since then, each side has accused the other of killing innocent civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No formal confirmation of the alleged attacks is available. Earlier this month, the interim government reported eyewitness accounts that Taylor's forces had killed over 300 people in an attack on Ulimo. But Ulimo's secretary-general, Joseph Taybior, said only 15 to 20 people died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ecomog imposed a cease-fire in Liberia in November 1990, ending almost two years of fighting among the NPFL, a splinter rebel group led by Prince Johnson, and the Liberian army.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1640 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WASHINGTON, DC$ % Will Acworth for Africa News Service$ %</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Kenyan officials have been lobbying the U.S. government and the World Bank to release millions of dollars of aid that was frozen last fall over concerns about corruption and human rights abuses in the East African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Saitoti, Kenya's vice president and minister of finance, and Wilson Ndolo Ayah, foreign affairs minister, argued Kenya's case in separate visits to Washington during September. Their message was that Kenya has met the conditions for a resumption of aid and desperately needs the assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite those efforts, however, it appears that the United States and the World Bank will continue to withhold aid until the Kenyan government follows through on its promise to hold multiparty elections that the international community recognizes as free and fair. Kenyan officials suggest that elections could occur as early as late November, although other sources say January is more likely.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenya elections are widely considered an important milestone in Africa's transition to political pluralism. One of the most stable and prosperous countries on the continent, the former British colony has been a de facto one-party state since the late 1960s, when President Jomo Kenyatta banned an opposition party led by former vice president Oginga Odinga. In the two decades since that crackdown, security forces have jailed, tortured, harassed and even murdered political dissidents. But until the late 1980s, relations with the West remained relatively positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1990, a growing pro-democracy movement has forced reforms in Kenya. Protests against the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu) grew so strong that the government of President Daniel arap Moi repealed the ban on opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven political parties have announced plans to compete in upcoming elections since the repeal of the ban. The two largest -- the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy and the Democratic Party -- have attracted massive crowds to campaign rallies in recent months. Despite intense internal divisions, the opposition parties are expected to win a substantial number of parliamentary seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan activists say that winning concessions from the government would have been more difficult without pressure from outside, and opposition leaders have succeeded in persuading the United States and other donors to maintain pressure on the Moi regime until the transition to democracy is complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last November in Paris, Kenya's principal foreign donors announced a joint decision to withhold about $ 300 million to $400 million in aid until the government made a number of economic and political reforms. High on the list of donor concerns was the issue of &quot;good governance,&quot; which officially was defined as &quot;transparency and accountability in decision-making&quot; but was interpreted widely as a concern about excessive corruption and political repression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Paris meeting, the Kenyan government has accelerated the move to political pluralism. As a result, some donors -- including France and the United Kingdom -- are moving to resume normal relations with Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and the World Bank have held firm on the aid freeze, however, leading the Kenyan government to intensify its efforts to improve relations with Washington. Saitoti, one of Moi's most trusted aides, discussed Kenya's economic and political reforms with top officials from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank during the groups' annual meeting last month. He also met with administration officials, including Herman Cohen, the assistant secretary of State for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with AfricaNews, Saitoti said he was told that the U.S. government is &quot;satisfied&quot; and &quot;happy&quot; with Kenya's political reforms, and he suggested that the two countries were on their way to a &quot;warmer and cordial relationship.&quot; After returning to Kenya, the vice president told reporters at a Nairobi press conference that the donors would end the aid freeze by mid-November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That interpretation is flatly denied by World Bank and U.S. officials, who agree that they are pleased by the reforms so far but insist that no change in policy on the aid freeze is imminent. Annoyed World Bank officials called Saitoti's comments &quot;exaggerated&quot; and &quot;premature,&quot; adding that such comments are typical of finance ministers who have just returned from annual meetings and are trying to impress constituents at home. U.S. officials were more circumspect, saying only that a resumption of aid will depend on &quot;concrete actions&quot; such as free and fair elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Ayah, who arrived in Washington at the end of September, took a slightly different tack. En route to New York to address the UN General Assembly on October 6, the soft-spoken foreign minister drew attention to the burdens placed on Kenya by regional drought, global recession and, most importantly, the crisis in neighboring Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayah told reporters that Kenya is hosting 450,000 Somali refugees -- not the 275,000 that the U.S. State Department estimates have crossed the border. Ayah said some of the refugees are heavily armed and that the influx has put an enormous strain on Kenya's meager resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to providing food and shelter, Kenya has been the principal logistical base within the region for the United Nations relief effort in Somalia and, despite some initial difficulties, has generally supported the UN effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayah also raised the specter of militant Islam, an issue that until recently was not a major concern in Kenya-U.S. relations. The Kenyan official claimed that Islamic fundamentalists in Iran and Sudan are funding the Islamic Party of Kenya (IPK), a newly formed political party based in the coastal city of Mombasa that has been denied permission to compete in the upcoming elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IPK appeared to pose little threat to the government until a violent crackdown on the party in May 1992, when police stormed a mosque and arrested several Imams. The move appears to have boosted popular support for the IPK among the predominantly Muslim people of the coast. Kenyan officials say they are pleased that the State Department has been tracking the ties between the IPK and its alleged Khartoum and Teheran patrons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to meeting Acting Secretary Lawrence Eagleburger and other State Department officials, Ayah went to Capitol Hill, where he saw several senators and representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional sources say the Washington meetings went well, but that the election remains the key issue. If the election is free and fair, legislators say, relations can go back to normal. But getting both sides to agree on what constitutes &quot;free and fair&quot; is posing some problems. Kenya has invited observers from the Commonwealth and the European Community but says that groups in the United States that have monitored elections in other parts of Africa are too biased to be trusted with the job in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Democratic Institute (NDI) has been highly critical of the Kenyan government's handling of the election process. The institute -- an arm of the federally funded National Endowment for Democracy -- is active in facilitating elections and political pluralism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an opinion piece for the Christian Science Monitor on September 2, NDI President Brian Atwood accused Moi of maneuvering to &quot;steal&quot; the election by imposing procedures that favor the government. NDI's concerns are shared by over 100 members of Congress, who signed a mid-August letter to Moi drafted by Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-MA) expressing doubts about the Kenyan government's commitment to free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayah's visit apparently helped soothe concerns on both sides. Kenyan officials -- who said earlier that no Americans would be asked to observe the balloting -- now say that they are ready to invite &quot;non-partisan&quot; U.S.  observers. Washington insiders say that the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, a Washington-based group with experience observing elections in several African countries, including this month's elections in Angola, has the inside track for the job. The Carter Center in Atlanta and the Congressional Black Caucus may also participate.  n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Desert, Somalia$ % Jennifer Griffin for Africa News Service$ % Omar Ado Ali, elder for the once 2,000-strong nomadic Hawiye clan, wipes his brow as he squints to look out over the group's last ten camels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed bands of soldiers who roam war-torn and starving Somalia have looted thousands of camels during the last two years of civil war that destroyed the country and induced a largely man-made famine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before, people used to come to us and beg and we used to help them.  Now we don't have money to buy basic necessities,&quot; says Omar. &quot;We are very sad.&quot; Omar himself used to own 200 camels and 300 cows.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Omar's group left the northern town of Belet Huen and began its two-year journey in search of security, 1,500 of its members have died from illness and starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between the two rivers that separate Somalia's fertile strip from an arid desert, bands of nomadic people once wandered from watering hole to watering hole settling for six months at a time before moving on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the nomads stay nowhere for longer than one night, unless they abandon their way of life and settle near one of Somalia's cities. Their days have become an endless trek to protect their last few animals from theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a March cease-fire between the country's two main warlords, the fighting continues, and vicious feuding continues to inhibit food distribution by aid agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nomads, who once made up half of Somalia's population, have been hit particularly hard by the anarchy that allows anyone with a gun to steal food or camels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survivors from Omar's withered clan were forced to settle outside the southern port capital, Mogadishu where they built dome-shaped, thorn tree twig hovels near a Red Cross feeding center to prevent their last ten camels from being stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some elders stand guard and Allah protects them,&quot; says Omar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the temporary security of their new home, every day another few people from the settled nomadic group die from starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar points to an empty hut covered in burlap surrounded by a low fence of thorn tree scrub bushes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seven persons lived there, but six of them died. The other one -- too weak -- was taken to hospital,&quot; says the 52-year-old Omar whose veins strained through the weathered skin on his forehead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mound of overturned orange sand marked by a strip of old cloth tied to a single stick showed where a baby was buried the night before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influx of rural people to the cities also may cause other kinds of pain to the proud nomads. Somalis of the towns often look down on the desert wanderers. &quot;We say (a nomad) is like those camels he is looking after. He doesn't bathe and his clothes smell,&quot; says Ali Ibrahim Mursat, who has lived in Mogadishu for 13 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty-two miles (100 kilometers) down a desert road from Omar's village, another clan marches its 90 camels toward Mogadishu. One camel might bring 250 U.S. dollars -- the currency of choice in today's Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as security problems increase and food remains scarce, some nomads say they will take whatever money they are offered for their camels. One clan's elder, 60-year-old Aden Farah Mohamud, whose good camels were looted by soldiers, says he would accept as little as $ 40 or $50 for one of the group's remaining camels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With money, the nomads can buy food for their families from the thriving markets in towns like Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having no need for money in the past, Aden's clan wandered the land, supporting themselves and eating mostly camel meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now most of the group's 90 camels, whose ribs have begun to show, are too weak to carry the clan's belongings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is left can be carried by the people,&quot; says Aden as he holds only the yellow plastic detergent bottle that he uses for water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clan's weaker members walk several miles behind the elder and three other men who discipline the camels with sticks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group eats once a day, normally at 4 p.m. But when the dried camel meat carried by the weaker family members runs out, the group sometimes doesn't eat for two or three days, Aden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since they can't stay in one place, the nomads no longer build the rounded twig houses that once protected them. &quot;We just sleep on the ground,&quot; says Aden, his cheeks hollowed from exhaustion and lack of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the former desert walkers move toward Mogadishu in search of food and safety, they lament their forced journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know Mogadishu,&quot; says Aden, who has visited a city only once in his life. &quot;The crowds of people bring a headache to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts on Somali culture say that the war has threatened more than the nomads' living conditions. For centuries, Somalia has been known as a nation of poets, and nomads were masters of the art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the rainy season, normal for this time of year, the desert once hummed with the sounds of herders singing to their camels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before the war we used to sing,&quot; says Aden. &quot;Now we are too sad.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jane Hunter for Africa News Service$ % Egypt is trying to head off an attempt by the Bush administration to stiffen United Nations sanctions aimed at forcing Libya to extradite two men accused of the 1988 bombing of a Pan American jet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late September, as Egypt stepped up efforts to negotiate a face-saving solution to the Pan Am case, Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Sidki and 12 of his cabinet ministers were in Libya, putting the finishing touches on a package of major economic agreements. This was the fourth meeting of a joint ministerial committee that Cairo and Tripoli set up in 1990 to oversee an ambitious program of economic integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic activity between the two nations has grown rapidly since 1989, when Egypt and Libya put 12 years of hostility behind them and re-established diplomatic ties. For Egypt, relations with its oil-rich but sparsely populated neighbor took on new urgency after Iraq invaded Kuwait and hundreds of thousands of Egyptian workers came home from the Persian Gulf to a jobless and landless future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of those displaced workers, Libya offers new possibilities.  Already, one million Egyptians -- teachers and professionals as well as laborers -- are reported to be living and working in Libya. The money they send home eases the pressure on Egypt's troubled economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this spring, 6,000 to 8,000 people were crossing the Libyan-Egyptian land border each day, according to Egyptian officials. In July, Egyptian exports to Libya were running at $ 25 million a month, according to theCairo newspaper Al-Ahram.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt has politely rebuffed Libyan leader Col. Muammar Quaddafi's proposal for political integration, saying through editorials in the semi-official press that such a union may evolve over time. Last February, however, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sidki was quoted by Middle Eastern reporters as saying that Egypt's periodic talks with Libya are aimed at the maximum economic integration possible. Such pragmatic collaboration promises infusions of Libyan cash, which Egypt badly needs to reduce its high foreign debt and finance job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint venture launched earlier this year, in which Libya will sell petroleum products to Egyptian consumers, will allow Egypt to export its own oil to earn hard currency. Domestic consumption presently absorbs about half Egypt's output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya's Tamoil, which operates 2,000 service stations in Italy, will provide 80% of the investment for the new company. Egypt's General Petroleum Corporation will hold 10%, with the remaining 10% sold to the public. The company plans to operate a string of service stations along the Egyptian coastal road that runs from the Libyan border to Alexandria. And Libya is to finance a pipeline from its refinery at Tobruk to Alexandria, which will carry petroleum products to be sold within Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other agreements under discussion include Libyan plans to finance a 400-mile railroad line connecting the two countries along their Mediterranean coasts and the interconnection of the two nations' electrical power grids, with plans to eventually hook up the entire Maghreb (the Arabic speaking states of North Africa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, just before the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya, discussions about the establishment of an Egyptian-Libyan bus company got under way. The venture would, in time, transport Muslim pilgrims from across the Maghreb to Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt and Libya also have been negotiating agreements on agriculture, fishing and ship repair. Libya has announced plans to build modern, irrigated settlements for Egyptian farmers in the southern part of its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late 1990 and early 1991, several delegations of Libyan military officers visited Cairo, giving rise to speculation that Libya would make investments in the Egyptian arms industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Egypt is caught between the country's new ties with Libya and its special relationship with the United States. Egypt is the world's second largest recipient of U.S. aid, after Israel, and a key supporter of U.S. policies in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egyptian President Hosni Mubarek has made repeated efforts to resolve the crisis created by the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. The crash killed 270 people. Mubarek has visited Libya several times to urge Quaddafi to turn over the two men indicted by the U.S. government a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mubarek has made equally strenuous efforts to persuade the United States and Great Britain, which has also brought charges against the two Libyans, to compromise on their demand that the men be tried in the United States or the United Kingdom. If Washington and London would agree to a trial in a neutral, third country, Mubarek says, Libya could surrender the men without appearing to surrender its national dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya, in apparent eagerness to avoid the isolation and economic damage of sanctions, has moved to comply with the demands of UN Resolution 748 that calls for Libya to distance itself from &quot;terrorist&quot; groups. The Quaddafi government has dismantled guerrilla training camps and given Britain information on past links with the Irish Republican Army. Although President Mubarek has been unable to get Washington and London to soften their position on the extradition issue, Egypt recently got the support of the Arab League. At a mid-September meeting, the group's foreign ministers praised Libya's flexibility and called on Western nations to accept Tripoli's recent appeal for direct negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The league also urged the UN Security Council to lift the sanctions against Libya. Like other Arab states, Egypt has been complying with the sanctions, while making some moves to mitigate their impact. Egyptair, for example, temporarily hired some workers from the grounded Libyan Arab Airlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egyptian officials are acutely aware that their prospects for economic cooperation with Libya hang on the thin thread of resolving the Lockerbie dispute. The current sanctions, imposed by the Security Council in April, are limited to a ban on air traffic, a prohibition of sales of arms, aircraft and spare parts, and a reduction in the size of Libyan diplomatic missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But moves to curb trade with Libya may come soon, according to a source on the House Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East, who asked not to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bush administration drive to get the United Nations to implement trade sanctions against Libya is &quot;coming to the crunch,&quot; the source says. And UN Undersecretary-General Vladimir Petrovsky warned at an August 21 press conference in Tunisia that the time for Libya to comply with the extradition demand is running out. The official predicted further action &quot;within days or weeks&quot; unless Libya responds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that action includes a ban on trade or travel, Egypt risks losing what its government sees as a crucial safety valve for its building economic pressures.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Polisario Front independence movement in Western Sahara says it is ready to resume hostilities if Morocco reneges on its promise to go along with a United Nations-supervised referendum to determine the territory's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than one year after the signing of a cease-fire agreement, Polisario is frustrated at the long delays in implementing the UN peace plan and at what it sees as the world body's indifference in the face of persistent provocation from Morocco. Polisario leader Salem Ould Salek spoke for many Saharans when he remarked in Algiers on October 4 that Rabat has led the peace plan into an impasse and that Polisario is ready to fight its way out of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Polisario has not given up on the UN, it is evident that its patience is wearing thin. The peace plan called for a vote last January, allowing Saharans to choose between independence and union with Morocco, which forcefully annexed the former Spanish colony in 1976. The ballot has been postponed indefinitely, due to disagreements over voter eligibility. Each side says the other is intransigent on the issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visitors to the recent Festival of Saharan Youth at the Saharan camps near Tindouf, just inside the Algerian border, encountered widespread disappointment and frustration among the tens of thousands of refugees who fled the Moroccan invasion. Amidst the festivities, the traditional singing and dancing, the military parades and the children's displays, there is real anger at what is seen as the UN's hypocrisy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq invaded Kuwait and there was an all-out war over it. Morocco annexed the Western Sahara and nothing happened,&quot; complained one embittered Saharan. The refugees know that Western Sahara is now a back-burner issue, not urgent enough for international civil servants to lose sleep over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Organization of African Unity has backed Polisario's call for Saharan self-determination, no powerful UN member has made an issue of the stalled peace process. Saharan refugees believe that Morocco's King Hassan II has effectively outmaneuvered the United Nations by moving in tens of thousands of Moroccans and asserting their right to vote as descendants of Saharan families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The king also has forged ahead with a constitutional referendum, which includes Western Sahara as a Moroccan province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee camps are located in Algeria, which has steadily supported the Polisario cause. But no one knows how Algeria, pressed by its own constitutional crisis, would respond to a resumption of the war. And there is no real evidence that Polisario is poised to return to guerrilla warfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polisario's top officials reiterate their commitment to the peace plan and their willingness to play by the UN rules. They say the cease-fire has been scrupulously observed, that every effort has been made to accommodate the UN peacekeeping force and that Polisario officials are ready to assist in the referendum process, provided an acceptable agreement on voter eligibility can be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they warn that Saharan patience has its limits. If pushed, Polisario will fight, say the Saharan commanders and their troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the monitoring of the cease-fire has been the only successful part of Minurso -- UN Mission for the Organization of a Referendum in Western Sahara. UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's latest report on the mission, released last August, praises the 300 Minurso military personnel who have been deployed in both Polisario- and Moroccan-controlled territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever Polisario's reservations about Minurso in general, relations between the independence movement and the UN troops on the ground appear excellent. Minurso officers were honored guests at the recent youth festival.  In conversation, the peacekeepers give every impression of enjoying their time with the Saharans, although they express concern at the lack of information about the peace process from diplomats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood also is cheerful at Minurso bases in Polisario-controlled territory, 300 miles west of the Algerian border, where Russians, Chinese, Americans and other international observers patrol the surrounding area, checking on Polisario units and keeping the UN flag flying. The peacekeeping troops compliment Polisario's fighting forces for being friendly, cooperative and professional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the Saharan combatants, camped out in the shells of buildings that were bombed by Morocco only days before the cease-fire in August 1991, conditions are considerably harsher than those enjoyed by Minurso, and the mood is markedly more serious. Here among the debris, the shells and the odd broken-down Moroccan tank, memories of the war are very fresh and very bitter.  The enemy has not changed, nor has Polisario's objective of Saharan self-determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the prevalent war-weariness, the atmosphere here suggests that Polisario's warning that fighting could begin again is more than mere posturing. n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Karen Gellen * Africa News Service A New York-based anti-apartheid group is taking the U.S. government to court, charging that Washington looked the other way as tons of American-made shotguns poured into South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africa Fund launched a law suit last month to force the federal government to release 1,100 documents detailing arms exports to Southern Africa. According to the Africa Fund, the illegal arms flow paralleled a sharp escalation in township fighting, leading to suspicions that the weapons helped fuel the violence that has killed more than 8,000 people since 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund acted after the Commerce Department refused to comply with a request for the documents that the fund filed in June 1991 under the Freedom of Information Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government officials say that disclosure would be contrary to the &quot;national interest&quot; and would &quot;jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anti-apartheid group charges that the Commerce Department repeatedly issued export licenses to companies violating U.S. sanctions laws and the United Nations arms embargo against South Africa. The Africa Fund says Washington has refused to investigate the documented diversion to South Africa of shotguns ostensibly destined for sporting goods shops in neighboring Southern African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a September 14 Federal District Court hearing on the civil suit, the Africa Fund publicly presented detailed evidence of such diversions. The group, working in cooperation with the Philadelphia-based American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), quietly provided the Commerce Department with much of the same material nearly two years ago. The documents show that in 1989-91, U.S. companies shipped large quantities of shotguns to the South African port of Cape Town and to Namibia's Walvis Bay, then under Pretoria's control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commerce Department memos obtained by the Africa Fund confirm government knowledge that many of the export licenses authorizing the shipments were &quot;fraudulent.&quot; But the evidence marshaled both by the anti-apartheid group and by government investigators has been consigned to &quot;a black hole in space,&quot; according to Africa Fund attorney Franklin Siegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation is on &quot;the bureaucratic slow track,&quot; says Siegal, who is affiliated with the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights. He says the apparent foot dragging stems from U.S. foreign policy priorities, charging that some embargoes are enforced vigorously, and some not at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siegal argues that the wheels have turned far more rapidly in other cases. &quot;Try to send a can of evaporated milk to Baghdad,&quot; he says, &quot;and they stop you at the airport, and the embassy in Amman, Jordan, knows your name. The U.S. is not taking the South African arms embargo seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Sobol, who is defending the Commerce Department in the Africa Fund suit, counters that &quot;the documents we're investigating are cumbersome.&quot; Sobol says &quot;it takes weeks and months to verify and corroborate.&quot; Another U.S. attorney in the case, Chinta Gaston, says the government is &quot;vigorously pursuing&quot; the probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africa Fund is calling for a halt to all arms shipments through South African ports, given the documented opportunity for diversion. The group also views high-volume shotgun sales to small neighboring states as highly suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report last month in the Johannesburg-based Weekly Mail cites documents confirming that over 50 tons of U.S-made munitions were exported to Southern Africa in the past four years. The documents show that &quot;hundreds of semi-automatic pistols, revolvers, rifles, magazines and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition left the United States but never arrived at their stated destination of Harare, Zimbabwe,&quot; the paper reports. &quot;The weapons,&quot; writes correspondent Peter Stober, &quot;were to have been shipped via Cape Town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one memo released by the Africa Fund, then Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger informs the Commerce Department that a shotgun dealer in Botswana, named as the buyer in one U.S. export license, &quot;apparently does not exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another memo from Eagleburger, who is currently acting secretary of State, describes a deal where the named customer in Zimbabwe, Tatos Brothers, denies placing two weapons orders for which U.S. export licenses were granted.  &quot;What became of these shipments,&quot; asks Eagleburger, &quot;if they did not go to Zimbabwe?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Africa Fund, the government should have anticipated the illegal opportunities presented by such loopholes and closed them from the outset. &quot;You don't send embargoed goods through an embargoed country,&quot; says the fund's research associate, Richard Knight. &quot;You wouldn't ship weapons to Amman through Baghdad or send hunting rifles through Bosnia right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization charges that at least 20 tons of U.S.-made shotguns and ammunition reached South Africa from mid-1990 to mid-1991 alone. The fund says it is an irony that eight tons of arms left New York harbor for South Africa in June l990, during Nelson Mandela's first U.S. visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testifying September 23 before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Africa Fund Executive Director Jennifer Davis charged that the Bush administration has declined &quot;to take effective public action&quot; against the violence plaguing South Africa. She decried in particular the administration's &quot;obstruction and delay rather than energetic investigation&quot; of the illegal shotgun exports documented by the Africa Fund and the AFSC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis termed the current situation in South Africa a &quot;replay&quot; of the protracted process leading to Namibia's independence. There was a l2-year delay, she recalled, between the first negotiated agreement on ending South African rule and the day the independence flag went up in 1990. It is now documented, noted Davis, that during the long years of talks, Pretoria utilized &quot;hit squads, death squads and dirty tricks&quot; to stave off independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing on her June visit to South Africa, Davis provided the Senate committee with graphic examples of conditions in northern Natal province, where local activists told her they were living like hunted prey. After recounting the mass killings and destruction of homes in the area, one labor organizer said, &quot;We are like gazelles. We have no home; we must lie down in the field at night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africa Fund alleges Washington is at best &quot;asleep at the switch&quot; for not stemming the arms flow to South Africa. The group cites a sizable arms cache discovered in May at the home of a Natal police officer. The cache included a shotgun manufactured by the Connecticut-based company, O.F. Mossberg &amp; Sons. Maston-Wright, the North Haven, CT, company that handles Mossberg exports, categorically denies &quot;any U.S. laws were broken&quot; in the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents obtained by the fund show that the Mossberg weapon had been licensed for export to a buyer in Zimbabwe. Commerce Department approval was given, even though the order was faxed directly from South Africa, with no accompanying documentation about the supposed customer in the neighboring country. The documents obtained by the Africa Fund detail scores of such shady deals involving phantom buyers outside South Africa or shipments made directly into Cape Town with no additional destination listed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund first provided the government with documentation of the sanctions-busting in November 1990. The recently obtained internal memos written by Eagleburger and others indicate that elements of the scam were clear to top officials. Those facts led Davis to tell the Foreign Relations Committee in mid-September that &quot;the claims that a good faith investigation is underway appear to be flimsy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some sources cite contending interests among the various government agencies involved -- Commerce, Customs and State -- as a factor in the seeming disarray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cable sent to Washington from the U.S. Embassy in Botswana, a copy of which was obtained by the Africa Fund, referred to the bogged-down investigation and noted that Botswana was balking at allowing more U.S. probes. The memo attributed the country's stand to irritation at &quot;Clouseau impersonators tramping about, each conducting his or her own little investigation, repetitively interrogating the same bemused officials and Botswana citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa Fund attorney Siegal charges that the disorganization and interagency rivalry are &quot;deliberately structured&quot; to stall the investigation. A serious government probe, he observes, is tightly coordinated by the attorney general and the FBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney Gaston rejects that view, asserting that crossed wires among various government agencies is often &quot;unavoidable&quot; and has &quot;no bearing&quot; on the diligence of the probe. In the long-running John Gotti case, for example, says Gaston, a series of &quot;Clouseau impersonators&quot; on the prosecution side enabled the now-jailed Mafia boss to evade conviction repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africa Fund, however, views those supposed obstacles as a pretext.  &quot;It's not as exotic as the government is making it appear in court,&quot; says Siegal. &quot;When they really want to investigate, they make sure people don't step on each other's toes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been stonewalled from the first,&quot; he says. &quot;Something fishy is going on.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reed Kramer * Africa News Service Washington, DC.  Administration officials are drafting a presidential directive redefining post-Cold War policy toward Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document, which President George Bush could sign in the next few weeks, is intended to help avoid future Somalias and fine-tune Washington's response to the rapid changes taking places across the African continent, senior officials say. The directive is the outcome of an extensive interagency study, known as National Security Review (NSR) 30, which was completed last month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Africa has received little attention during the current presidential campaign, in which foreign policy has been a side issue to the economy, Governor Bill Clinton this month criticized Bush for an &quot;ambivalence about supporting democracy.&quot; The governor earlier decried the administration's &quot;months of neglect&quot; of famine in Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush has defended his record, pointing in a recent statement &quot;to significant achievements in Africa over the last four years in conflict resolution, support for burgeoning democracies and human rights, and assisting in humanitarian crises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparation of the policy review has involved more than a dozen federal agencies, according to administration sources. Although the study was begun before Somalia attracted top-level attention, unease over the slow response to the Somali crisis has spurred the decision-making process, officials say. &quot;Some people thought we should wait -- this close to election time -- but after what happened in Somalia, we decided we had to move this thing forward,&quot; one senior administration aide said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review has looked at ways to promote political stability and economic growth, how to expand American markets and to preserve Africa's fragile ecology, and at what can be done to settle the continent's on-going wars. &quot;We've always looked at Africa through the prism of East/West competition,&quot; the official said. &quot;Now that that has melted away, we can focus on what's important for Africa and what best serves our interests in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our major focus is humanitarian, now that all the Cold War baggage is gone,&quot; another official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his most recent foreign policy speech, Clinton said the president &quot;has been slow to place America's support behind the fledgling democratic movements&quot; in Africa. Speaking in Milwaukee on October 1, the Democratic nominee said the United States must &quot;encourage and nurture the stirrings for democratic reform that are surfacing all across Africa.&quot; He said the administration had pursued a &quot;failed&quot; policy towards South Africa and &quot;had to be prodded&quot; to impose sanctions and to pressure Pretoria to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush administration officials say they don't see major differences on Africa policy issues between the two candidates. They expect the current reassessment and the resulting directive to guide American relations with Africa no matter who gets elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike previous policy reviews, where contentious questions often led to heated disagreements between departments or agencies, the latest study has evoked almost no dissension. &quot;It's remarkable how agreed everyone is,&quot; says one official involved in coordinating the input from the various parts of the federal bureaucracy. &quot;We have been able to concentrate on setting priorities and choosing emphases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants in NSR 30 include officials from the departments of State, Defense, Treasury and Commerce, and from the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Export Import Bank, and the Peace Corps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to several officials, the language outlining the premises of the draft presidential directive is much like the statement the administration submitted to Africa Report, published by the New York-based African-American Institute. &quot;Our basic interests are the promotion of peaceful change and conflict resolution, democracy and improved governance, free market economic policies, sustainable development, and effective African action on transnational issues such as AIDS, the environment, population growth and terrorism,&quot; Bush says in the statement, which appears in the current issue of the magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NSR 30 emphasizes the need for greater U.S. support for conflict resolution, officials say. &quot;We recognize that it is difficult to advance any of our other objectives when fighting is underway,&quot; says one of the document's authors. &quot;We have strengthened conflict management capabilities at both the national and regional levels in Africa,&quot; Bush told Africa Report. &quot;Our goal is to encourage Africans to play a greater role in solving Africa's problems and conflicts and to involve more fully the rest of the world community, especially the United Nations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one unannounced move in that direction, the president signed a formal &quot;determination&quot; last month authorizing U.S. funding for a planned peacekeeping operation by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the continent-wide grouping of 51-member-nations. The action was sparked by an agreement now in the works, for an OAU-initiated multilateral force to monitor a cease-fire between government troops and an armed rebel movement in Rwanda, in preparation for national elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the projected U.S. contribution is only $ 500,000, the presidential determination positions the administration to make additional outlays for OAU-directed peacekeeping when additional opportunities arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton, in a statement also published by Africa Report, says U.S.  support for democracy in Africa and around the world should not be pursued &quot;selectively or half-heartedly.&quot; The democratic nominee advocates &quot;a new strategy of American engagement&quot; to support &quot;the spread of consolidation&quot; of democracy in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush administration has been tepid when it should have been decisive in ending aid to dictators, such as Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, in reacting to the crisis caused by escalating violence in South Africa, in responding to the humanitarian tragedy in Somalia,&quot; he says. &quot;I believe we can do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Clough, a Clinton advisor on Africa, says the United States could have done much more to support positive trends in Africa, even with limited resources. Clough, who is director of the World Policy Institute in New York, sees the current policy reappraisal as a classic case of too little too late. &quot;If we had been serious about creating a stable democratic Africa,&quot; he says, &quot;we wouldn't have some of the crises we now have. Somalia did not have to happen.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cities and towns across the country, Ghanaians are agog with electioneering, as the West African nation moves toward its first national ballot in more than a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cars and vans displaying party symbols and colors blare slogans and songs from rooftop-mounted loudspeakers.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever two or three people congregate there is lively political discussion, and interest grows as election day nears.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be the fourth time since independence in 1957 that Ghana could try to establish multiparty constitutional government. It will be the second time that Flt. Lt.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time Rawlings is himself a player. He retired from the Ghana Air Force in mid-September to qualify as a candidate for the presidency.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although campaign excitement is apparent, an underlying layer of disquiet is evident. Politicians and the press preach peace, and prayers in churches and mosques call for a harmonious outcome to the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But mutual mistrust characterizes supporters and opponents of the government. Tensions have been increased by the agitation and strikes called by civil servants and other public employees that have been taking place alongside the electoral campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By September 30, the deadline for filing for the presidency, five candidates and nine parties had registered. By early October, according to the Interim National Electoral Commission, five parties had registered 1,000 candidates for the 200 parliamentary seats. But the number of contestants could drop as a result of mergers or alliances before election day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major parties that emerged after the ban on political activity was lifted in May all claim the mantle of half-century-old parties -- one populist, one conservative -- whose rivalry dates from the independence struggle in the 1940s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the dominance of these two traditions has been challenged by the emergence of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), led by Rawlings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four parties trace their ancestry to the old Convention People's Party, founded in 1949 by the country's first president, Kwame Nkrumah. They are: the People's Heritage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party (PHP), led by Emmanuel Erskine, a general who formerly headed United Nations peacekeeping forces in Lebanon; former President Hilla Limann's People's National Convention (PNC); the National Independence Party (NIP), headed by wealthy poultry farmer and fundamentalist Christian Kwabena Darko; and the National Convention Party (NCP), chaired by K. N. Arkaah, a Harvard-trained economist and former international civil servant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among several elements of the opposition, the old rivalry is yielding to a shared determination to see Rawlings lose. At the end of last month, Limann's PNP announced agreement with the New Patriotic Party (NPP) to support each others' candidates in the event of a presidential run-off. The exception to the anti-Rawlings movement is the National Convention Party, which has entered an electoral alliance with Rawlings' NDC and named NCP leader Arkaah as Rawlings' running mate. A key figure in the NCP is Capt. Kojo Tsikata, the number two official in the ruling military council who is blamed by many for the regime's human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition grouping that seems to have the most popular support is the New Patriotic Party (NPP), with origins in the old conservative nationalist United Party and a solid following from middle class urban voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Ghanaians seem to be gravitating towards the NPP and its standard-bearer, the well-known historian Albert Adu Boahen, as the only strong competition to oust Rawlings and the NDC. One of the Nkrumahist formations, the PHP, has already said it might ally with the NPP to try to insure a Rawlings defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NDC is running on Rawlings' record of economic recovery. The country's structural adjustment program is hailed by Western donors and international financial institutions and has attracted millions of dollars in foreign aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government can point to the rehabilitation of the country's communications infrastructure, heavy investments in mines and extractive industries, reorganization of the banking sector, and the invigoration of service industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the economic reforms have dealt a hard blow to local manufacturing and to food production. And despite its ambitious programs, a reputation for honesty and competence among officials, and an economic growth rate that is among the highest in Africa, Ghana has had little success in attracting overseas capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings also faces criticism because of the high level of unemployment and the reduction of government subsidies for health, education, and agriculture. Urban workers have lost earning power, and they blame their plight on Rawlings' economic austerity program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, opposition parties have offered almost no substantive alternative plans, promising instead to make changes on the fringes of the economic reforms. The NPP's Boahen says he supports the recovery program in principle but differs with Rawlings on implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Private investors have refused to participate in the economy because they are afraid of persecutions,&quot; Boahen said. &quot;It should have been possible for us to register an 11% to 12% growth rate, not the 5.6% the government has so far achieved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition's strongest plank is probably its criticism of the government's human rights record, which is widely viewed as the worst of any administration since independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparations for voting are moving ahead. International observer missions, including teams from the Carter Center in Atlanta and the British Commonwealth, are lined up to monitor the process. But the national electoral commission has warned that incidents of political violence could pose a threat to the transition program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the commission accused the government of being &quot;petrified into inaction&quot; and said it would not be able to &quot;perform the work for which we were created&quot; if the violence is not stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's accounting of the violent acts implicates supporters of Rawlings' NDC for attacking NPP loyalists in many parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has announced the registration of over eight million voters, after the elimination of 1.5 million names believed to represent duplication. The figure is still seen as suspiciously high by some observers, since such a large segment of the country's less than 16 million population is under 15 years of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure unfettered campaigning, the opposition had demanded the repeal of the Preventive Detention Custody Law and the Habeas Corpus Amendment Law, adopted in 1982 and 1984 and used by the military government to detain critics without charge or trial. On October 2, both laws were rescinded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than a decade at the top, Rawlings is clearly the focus of the debate. The opposition says the new parliamentary system is doomed to instability if Rawlings remains on the political scene. The last time he turned over power to an elected administration, he returned 27 months later to stage another takeover, ousting President Limann from office in 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Rawlings has expressed doubts that the opposition would accept an NDC victory peacefully. He says he expects the results to be challenged if he emerges as winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning by government opponents has been overshadowed by the NDC effort. Rawlings has the support of paramilitary organs created by the regime, the national women's organization that is headed by his wife, and district and administrative agencies established in recent years as part of the transition to elected civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition parties say they lack the resources to effectively challenge the NDC, which they suspect is using state facilities and funds. Nor can opponents match Rawlings' populist stagecraft, which attracts rural people and considerable sections of the urban youth. Nevertheless, the opposition alliance itself commands large followings, and the outcome of the voting remains unpredictable. n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After nearly two years of unsettled calm, Liberia has been thrust back into active warfare. Fighting broke out on October 15, just outside Monrovia, the capital, between the West African peacekeeping force, known as Ecomog, and the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), led by Charles Taylor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brutal civil strife began at the end of 1989 and continued until Ecomog separated three warring Liberian factions in late 1990. The conflict left an estimated 60,000 persons dead -- 20,000 from the fighting and another 40,000 who starved. The war also destroyed most of the country's infrastructure and uprooted half the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor has accused Ecomog, which includes soldiers from seven West African nations, of trying to keep him from taking power. West African leaders have been attempting to broker a peace arrangement that was to have led to elections before the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest fighting, Ecomog has bombarded Taylor's forces and NPFL commandos have conducted nighttime raids into Monrovia where some reportedly have knifed Ecomog soldiers to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting has disrupted the city's electricity, water and communications services, and has sent tens of thousands of people scurrying from areas around the capital into the city center. The situation is an eerie repetition of events during the summer of 1990, when refugees thronged into Monrovia to escape fighting in the countryside. Monrovia residents are fighting off panic that the conflict will again sweep through the city as it did then.</SPAN></P>

In a speech on October 20, Prime Minister Belaid Abdesselam told Algerians that he needs at least three years to spark economic recovery and stabilize the country's political climate before elections can be held.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials cite the rise of Islamic fundamentalism as the basis for political instability in Algeria. The government banned the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) opposition group last March after it appeared headed for an electoral victory. President Ali Kafi claims that the FIS's goal is to destabilize the current government through the use of violence. FIS supporters have been blamed for killing about 140 members of the state security forces since the government imposed a state of emergency in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In mid-October, Kafi signed a measure that will allow sentences ranging from five years to life imprisonment without appeal for people convicted of terrorism, in an attempt to curb mounting violence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only days before Ghana's November 3 presidential election, politicians opposed to incumbent military leader Flt. Lt. Jerry Rawlings have gone to court seeking to disqualify him as a candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Bilson, a prominent politician and physician, wants the courts to bar Rawlings from the contest on the grounds that he is not a Ghanaian citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings' paternal parentage is unknown -- a point constantly raised by his opponents to ridicule him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bilson also wants the court to stop the Interim National Electoral Commission (IEC) from holding the elections until Rawlings is struck from the contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost nobody expects the courts to grant Bilson and his supporters their plea. The purpose of the case may be more to throw political pebbles that embarrass the head of state rather than a serious attempt to get Rawlings out of the race by legal means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge, an object of public sympathy, adjourned the case from October 19 to 21, pleading the need for more time to study the presentations.  In the streets of Accra, security forces had difficulty restraining angry Rawlings followers who gathered when the court sat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though reports continue of isolated cases of political violence, there has been no major disruption of the electoral program. But several religious and civil groups organized a march for October 31 to call for peaceful elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, workers have mounted demonstrations in the industrial city of Tema, near Accra, in the central provisional capital of Cape Coast, and elsewhere. Organized labor is apprehensive that government promises for wage raises and other improvements will not be kept after the elections are over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election campaign is lively. The Ghana Broadcasting Corporation is televising interviews with the five presidential candidates and the University of Ghana Alumni Association organized a symposium in Accra for all the presidential hopefuls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the debates go on, the ruling Provisional National Defense Council has increased soldiers' pay and has been giving contracts to rehabilitate roads, build public projects and renovate collapsed structures in several rural communities. The opposition says the actions are a play to win votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition also demands the repeal of repressive laws still on the books. The secretary of the Interior can order &quot;administrative detention&quot; arbitrarily, and the PNDC has the power to execute people for political offenses -- a deterrent, critics say, to the conduct of a free election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following a six-hour meeting of the Armed Forces Ruling Council, Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida canceled the results of the October presidential primaries based on reports of massive fraud and malpractice. In a speech at Abuja, the nation's capital, Babangida also announced the dissolution of both the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC) party leadership and gave control of the parties to provisional caretaker committees. He asked the National Electoral Commission (NEC) to propose a new election process within two weeks and to organize party conventions, that will restructure party leadership and produce an official list of presidential candidates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Nigerians are concerned that Babangida's latest actions will postpone indefinitely the country's transition to civilian rule. A spokesman for the Lagos-based Civil Liberties Organization accused the president of setting the stage for electoral fraud and then using the botched primaries as an excuse to prolong his stay in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election results were canceled once before during this presidential race. Following the primary held on August 6, NRC and SDP officials voided the results, citing &quot;widespread malpractice.&quot; Vice President Augustus Aikhomu warned party officials and candidates that the government would intervene if the primaries failed again. After two reportedly successful rounds of primaries, the third round resulted in a resurgence of cries of vote rigging.  Ten of 12 SDP presidential candidates withdrew from the race in protest of government inaction on their charges against party chairman Baba Kingabe.  Candidates alleged that Kingabe had conspired with party officials to name retired general, Shehu Musa Yar' Adua, as the party's presidential candidate.  Eleven NRC candidates also protested the election results. On October 6, Babangida's government intervened and put the primaries on hold pending the results of a NEC investigation of charges of electoral fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babangida, who has been Nigeria's head of state since 1985, has pledged to return control of the country to civilian rule in January of 1993.</SPAN></P>

But opposition leaders say they still are not convinced that Banda will ease political restrictions in the country and allow a truly free vote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda, believed to be over 90 years of age, has governed the small southern African nation since independence in 1964. Two years after taking office he banned opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 20, Orton Ching'oli Chirwa, a close colleague of Banda's during the independence campaign and the country's first attorney-general, died in jail after a lengthy imprisonment. Chirwa, exiled after a fallout with Banda, was kidnapped with his wife by Malawian security agents along the Malawi-Zambia border in 1981, was convicted and condemned to death for treason. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after an international clemency campaign by human rights groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, international aid donors suspended aid to Malawi and called for improvement in the treatment of dissidents. Amnesty International says the Malawi government routinely detains and tortures opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government denies the accusations, and Banda, a self-declared &quot;president for life,&quot; contends that his decision to allow the referendum will prove conclusively that the people of Malawi prefer his single-party leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several former top members of Banda's Malawi Congress Party have formed a coalition to press for multiparty democracy. The group, known as the United Democratic Front, welcomed Banda's decision to hold the referendum but said that all those involved in campaigning for or against the change should be given equal access to state-run media. The front also is calling for international monitors for the referendum process to ensure that voting is conducted fairly.</SPAN></P>

In their proposals for an interim government, Rwandan officials have invited RPF leaders to join the present parliament but say all other opposition groups should be elected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">RPF officials insist that the government dissolve the parliament and form a new legislative body representing all national parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, in mid-October, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Ahmed Hassan Diria, who is chairing the talks, announced that both groups had made compromises and were close to signing a peace accord that would end two years of civil war in the central African country. Both groups agreed that some powers of the presidency would be transferred to an appointed all-party cabinet. The prime minister would nominate cabinet ministers, who would be endorsed by parliament. The president would chair cabinet meetings, but would have no veto power over cabinet decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the areas of disagreement between the RPF and government officials is how to share judicial power with members of opposition groups. And the two sides remain split over the length of the transition period. The government wants the interim administration in place for six months before elections are held; the RPF has proposed a four-year transitional government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negotiations are aimed at ending conflict between the government and the RPF, which invaded the country from neighboring Uganda in August 1990.  Signing of a peace accord was scheduled for October 1, but the RPF demand for more far-reaching political reforms has delayed the agreement.</SPAN></P>

Amnesty representatives have presented Tunisian officials with evidence of torture and the deaths of several prisoners while in custody.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of the London-based human rights organization are calling for a full government investigation of the allegations. The group says observers report that the courts heard insufficient evidence to substantiate the charges against the defendants. Amnesty observers also reported that the prisoners did not have lawyers during their months in detainment, and that some of the defendants, who told the courts that they had been the victims of torture, had to be supported by police officers to walk. Tunisian Foreign Minister Habib ben Yahia denied Amnesty's charges and said that the government is investigating the circumstances of one prisoner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali's government has cracked down on Tunisia's Islamic fundamentalist movement since he came to power in a bloodless coup in 1987. He claims that the arrests were necessary to protect the country, located between Algeria and Libya, from a coup attempt and potential civil war. In July, 279 Muslim fundamentalists were accused of being members of the banned An-Nahda movement and were tried before a military tribunal in Tunis.  Fifty-five defendants were tried in absentia, including An-Nahda President Rached Ghannouchi. Several of those who were convicted were sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doom and gloom. Doom and gloom is mostly what you report on Africa. I find it hard to believe that virtually nothing good ever happens across almost 12 million square miles of land occupied by millions of people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find it hard to believe that the motherland of civilization no longer has anything good to say or offer the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would expect a negatively skewed portrayal of Africa on the pages of the New York Times or the Washington Post. After all, that's their job in the Western habit of downplaying the significance or mere existence of Africa. But AfricaNews is supposed to be different. Isn't it? Yet there is hardly ever a positive headline on the front page of AfricaNews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My criticism is not that reporting of negative or tragic occurrences on the continent should not be done, but rather that the reporting should be more balanced with positive events. For example: What progress is being made in housing development? What are the African scientists working on? What is new in African art and music? What of human perseverance stories of how the children and women deal with the problems of life in African countries?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walter Collier, Oak Bluffs, MA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reporting on the many positive changes taking place in Africa is a priority for us, as is trying to keep our readers abreast of important political and economic developments. With our limited staff and financial resources, the scramble to stay current means that coverage of crises affecting millions of Africans may take precedence over the optimistic stories you suggest. But you can find some of these in our recent issues, and more are on the way.  -- Ed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Report on the Commission of Inquiry Into Complaints by Former African NationalCongress Prisoners and Detainees</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">3400 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Terms of Reference</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In letters to each of the members of the Commission, the President of the ANC indicated his attitude to the task of the Commission.  The letter stated, among other things, the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Complaints have been made to the ANC by a number of persons who were previously held as prisoners by it in camps outside of South Africa concerning the conditions in which they were held, the manner in which they were treated and the manner in which their property was dealt with after their detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These complaints are serious and call for a full and thorough investigation by the ANC to establish whether or not they are correct, and if they are, what action it should take in consequence thereof.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Physical Conditions of Detention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence was presented about the conditions of detention at various prison camps. These prison camps included those specially set up by the ANC, as well as ordinary prisons run by the governments of the countries in which they were situated. It is clear from the evidence, however, that the gravest abuses were perpetrated in Quatro camp in Angola. This camp was apparently also known as &quot;Camp 32&quot; and the &quot;Morris Seabelo Rehabilitation Center.&quot; It was originally conceived of as a rehabilitation center. The terms of reference empowered the commission to visit the places of detention subject to making the necessary arrangements with the governments of the countries concerned. In the case of Quatro, we were informed by witnesses that the camp had been demolished. An inspection, therefore, would have revealed little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaints about the physical conditions of detention related mainly to the type of cells in which detainees were held, the lack of proper medical facilities and poor nutrition. What follows is a general overview of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cells</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The evidence revealed that at Quatro camp, provision was made for both communal cells as well as isolation cells. The communal cells were, from time to time, overcrowded and inadequately ventilated. We were told that on occasions, the temperature inside the cell was higher than outside it. Certain detainees were held in solitary confinement, often for extended periods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hygiene and Medical Care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the persistent and most severe complaints which emerged from the evidence concerned the lack of adequate health treatment. The necessity for medical care cannot be separated from the conditions under which detainees were held. We were told that the tropical climate in Angola resulted in high temperatures. Problems associated with the heat and the conditions of detention included the development of skin complaints, diarrhea and malaria. We were advised that there was no running water in the entire camp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These difficulties affected all and not only the detainees. However, the evidence revealed that the camp guards and commanders made it virtually impossible for detainees to maintain themselves and their clothing in a healthy condition. We were informed that blankets were allowed to be washed only once every six months and that the detainees were then allowed to bathe in the water which remained after the blankets had been washed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toilet facilities for detainees were primitive. Detainees were required to attend to their bodily functions by means of plastic containers, which were cut in half and which were emptied once a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appeared that no suitable qualified medical officer was available at all times to deal with the day-to-day medical problems of detainees. A doctor did visit the camp, but only on rare occasions. We were informed that his attitude was generally unsympathetic since he was advised in advance that the detainees were responsible for the deaths of members of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of suitably qualified medical personnel was particularly serious in view of the injuries suffered by inmates at the hands of their captors. Many detainees were severely assaulted and injured. Not only was the health care inadequate, but we were informed that some of the medical orderlies actually participated in the assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Food</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consensus of the witnesses was that the food at Quatro camp was worse than anywhere else. The diet consisted primarily of beans and rice.  Certain detainees received one glass of water every 24 hours. In 1987, the then president of the ANC, Mr. Oliver Tambo, visited Quatro camp. Although he was apparently disturbed by what he saw, his visit had little impact upon the food situation. Indeed, for some six months thereafter, the diet of detainees consisted mainly of diluted tomato puree and rice. Food deprivation was frequently used as a form of punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of adequate nutrition was, in our view, unconscionable and pernicious. We were informed that the camp had an adequate supply of tropical fruit which grew freely in the vicinity, but which was out of bounds to detainees. The camp commanders, in contrast to the detainees, had a plentiful supply of food, which included tinned products supplied to the camp. Any food left over after the commanders had their fill was fed to the pigs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maltreatment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A striking feature of the evidence presented to the commission was its consistency. The experience of the former detainees was depressingly similar, varying only in degree of severity. The witnesses who testified included persons still loyal to the ANC and those who are hostile to the ANC. It included persons convicted of crimes and others never charged. The periods of detention and the alleged reasons therefore varied markedly. Yet, the same practices and names cropped up over and over again. We rule out the possibility of collusion or fabrication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not proposed in this report to detail the treatment of each detainee individually. The individual statement of the detainees together with the typed record of the inquiry will be made available separately to the president of the ANC. A general overview of the abuses will be given. The most persistent abuses were perpetrated in Quatro, which was not inappropriately described by one witness as a concentration camp. There were abuses, sometimes of the most chilling kind, perpetrated elsewhere. These will be dealt with separately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quatro</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quatro was essentially a camp for suspected enemy agents and dissidents. The attitude of the camp guards, commanders and medical assistants seemed to be universally hostile to the inmates. The inmates, whether convicted of any offenses or not, were denigrated, humiliated and abused, often with staggering brutality. The violence inflicted on the prisoners usually had nothing whatsoever to do with any disciplinary transgression. It was violence for the sake of violence. One witness articulated what emerged as the common experience of the detainees. He said that after a while, he no longer knew how to behave. Any excuse was seized upon by the guards to inflict punishment. We set out below the main forms of abuse. We emphasize that not every detainee was subjected to the practices described hereunder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Discipline and Denigration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All detainees were given names which sometimes bore derogatory or humiliating connotations. Names of some of the group of 32 included &quot;donkey,&quot; &quot;goat,&quot; &quot;monkey,&quot; &quot;pig&quot; and &quot;fool.&quot; The general disciplinary regime was harsh and arbitrary. Talking during work was forbidden. Requests of almost any sort were frowned upon and often met with assault. Detainees were forbidden to reveal their real names to each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hard Labor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Various forms of hard labor were required from some of the detainees.  In the main, hard labor consisted of felling trees, chopping wood, breaking stones, digging trenches and hauling a water cart. It was the latter form of hard labor that elicited the greatest bitterness. The camp had no running water. Accordingly, water had to be collected in a tank from a spout near the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Assault and Punishment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A variety of assaults and punishments were regularly meted out to detainees. One form of abuse, known as &quot;pompa&quot; was described by one witness as a &quot;tradition&quot; at Quatro. The victim was required to puff out his cheeks while being repeatedly slapped in the face. The effect was to create unbearable pressure on the eardrums and excruciating pain. Nearly every witness who appeared before the commission was a victim of this abuse. Some complained of burst eardrums and bleeding from the ears. The evidence revealed that this form of abuse was routine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another practice frequently carried out was known as &quot;gas mask.&quot; A pawpaw shell, from which the pulp had been removed, was pushed into the face of the detainee until he could no longer breathe. This practice was widespread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other Places of Detention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quatro was evacuated in December 1988, in terms of the New York Accord which stipulated that the ANC had to leave Angola with its soldiers, prisoners and equipment by March 31, 1989. Close to 90 detainees were taken from Quatro to Nonkala, a warehouse in Luanda. This was to be a temporary prison. The evidence established that the evacuation from Quatro was particularly unpleasant. We were told prisoners were piled into trucks and some were handcuffed to other prisoners. Newcomers were apparently handcuffed to those who had spent time in Quatro. This was done as a precaution to prevent the newcomers from escaping since they were in better physical condition and more likely to attempt to escape than other prisoners. One of the detainees who testified before us told us hat he fainted on the way to Nonkala, as a result of the heat in the truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Nonkala, some prisoners were taken to Uganda and others to Kakawa in Tanzania. Conditions in the Ugandan prison, while better than Quatro, still left much to be desired. The evidence established acts of gratuitous and random violence perpetrated on the detainees by the camp guards, but not with the same frequency that occurred at Quatro. One of the noteworthy features of the period of detention in Uganda was attempts by certain ANC officials to improve conditions. Several witnesses specifically singled out the efforts of Tenjiwe Mthintso, the ANC's chief representative in Uganda. She apparently displayed a genuine capacity to listen to complaints and as a result of her efforts conditions improved. We were informed that for the first time, detainees were able to relate their complaints without the guards being present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forced Confessions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We heard several harrowing accounts of the use of torture to extract confessions. In the main, attempts to extract confessions preceded internment at Quatro. The means used to extract confessions were, according to the witnesses, brutal in the extreme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the witnesses who appeared before the Commission from whom confessions were allegedly extracted by torture stated that they had made the confessions simply to escape the pain. They denied that their confessions were true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Loss of Property</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the witnesses who appeared before the Commission complained that personal possessions had been confiscated from them and that they have either not been compensated at all or have been inadequately compensated. In the main, complaints of loss of property related to clothing and jewelry. Upon their return to South Africa, some former detainees received vouchers to enable them to purchase clothing from a particular shop. It is not proposed in this report to detail the items lost by each witness who testified before the Commission. A schedule will be made available to the President of the ANC and appropriate recommendations will be made hereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Treatment of the Mutineers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although we considered the focus of this inquiry to be the group of 32, some evidence was led by those who were detained as a result of their alleged participation in the 1984 mutiny. There are a number of published accounts on the mutiny including a chapter in the recently published book by Stephen Ellis and Tsepo Sechaba entitled Comrades Against Apartheid. The authors record that included in the demands of the mutineers was the suspension of the ANC security apparatus and an investigation of Quatro. The mutiny was the subject of an official inquiry by the ANC led by James Stuart. We were eventually furnished with a copy of the Stuart Commission report. The contents of that report were never made public and, it seems, not formally tabled before the ANC National Executive Committee. According to Ellis and Sechaba, although the findings of the Commission were never released, it was widely known that the investigators attributed blame for the mutiny on the excesses of the security department, poor political education, poor recreational facilities and quality of food and the yearning to go home and fight. These are indeed the findings of the Stuart Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was evidence that both soldiers and mutineers died in the exchange of fire. We were told that some of the mutineers were thereafter executed. The circumstances in which this occurred are far from clear. However, there is a sense of unease that these executions may have been carried out summarily. It appears that after the initial executions, strenuous efforts were made to stop the executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recommendations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In making the recommendations that follow, we have been guided by three principles: redress, accountability and prevention.  In accordance with these principles, we make the following recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Those witnesses who were detained without trial should have the allegations against them unequivocally and unconditionally withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) All witnesses who suffered maltreatment while being detained in ANC camps should receive monetary compensation for their ordeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Some of the witnesses who appeared before us were, in our view, in need of medical and psychological assistance.  Such should be offered and provided by the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) Some of the witnesses expressed the desire to continue with their education which had been interrupted by long periods of detention.  We recommend that the ANC provide assistance in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) Detainees who lost property should be compensated for such loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) We suggest that consideration be given to the creation of an independent structure which is perceived to be impartial (in place of continuing a formal Commission of Inquiry) and which is capable of documenting cases of abuse and giving effect to the type of recommendations made in this report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) We suggest that the impartial and independent structure referred to in paragraph (6) above, or some other appropriate body be charged with the responsibility of investigating all allegations of disappearances and murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(8) We strongly recommend that urgent and immediate attention be given to identifying and dealing with those responsible for the maltreatment of detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(9) We strongly recommend that the Thami Zulu Commission report be released to the public and once the NEC has received the Stuart Commission report it too should be considered for public release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(10) Finally, the terms of reference of this Commission contain an undertaking that this report will be released to the public.  We strongly recommend that this be done as soon as possible.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">427 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the wake of an internal investigation detailing human rights violations by some of its exiled leaders, the African National Congress (ANC) has promised &quot;as a matter of urgency&quot; to find and punish those responsible for the &quot;serious abuses and irregularities&quot; that occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A three-member panel of lawyers -- two of them members of the ANC -- issued the report in late October, following a seven-month inquiry. &quot;We were left with an overall impression that for the better part of the 1980s, there existed a situation of extraordinary abuse of power and lack of accountability,&quot; the panel members said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody was beyond the reach of the security apparatus,&quot; the lawyers reported, citing the experiences of Pallo Jordan, a senior ANC official now heading the Information Department, who spent six weeks in detention in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report identifies Quatro, an ANC detention camp in Angola, as a place where systematic abuses took place. ANC members suspected of collaboration with the South African government were held in Quatro and other detention facilities, where they were interrogated and sometimes tortured, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practices covered by the report took place during a time when the exiled organization was fighting for its existence. In a policy that spread suspicion and paranoia throughout the ANC, the South African government infiltrated the group with hundreds of agents and used the information they gleaned to block ANC attacks, to plan assassination attempts against top ANC leaders, and to launch military raids against the movement's offices and supporters in neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference where the report was issued, ANC President Nelson Mandela said the abuses &quot;must be understood in the context in which they occurred.&quot; But he strongly condemned the actions themselves as &quot;inexcusable&quot; and said the ANC leadership had agreed already to the panel's principal recommendation -- an independent investigation into the abuses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunni Khalid for Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angolan opposition leader Jonas Savimbi is a tough fighter. He founded the rebel movement Unita and battled Portuguese rule for nine years in the fertile, empty expanses of central and southern Angola with little external support. After Angola's independence, he waged guerrilla war for 16 years against a government that was backed by 40,000 Cuban troops and large-scale Soviet military aid. He lobbied for and won the enthusiastic endorsement of the American government and substantial covert assistance from the CIA and from South Africa. In the end, he outfoxed his war-weary adversaries and an overextended international community and got the national elections he said he wanted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When campaigning in Angola's first-ever contested national vote began, the elections were Savimbi's to lose. The electorate seemed anxious for an alternative to 16 years of botched socialism under a corrupt government, which had quickly jettisoned its ideology when its former sponsor, the Soviet Union, fell apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Unita and the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) were confident they could win at the ballot box the political hegemony that had eluded them on the battlefield. But many foreign observers were convinced that Savimbi would easily defeat the incumbent president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, a former petroleum engineer trained in the Soviet Union, who has led the country since the death of its internationally known first president, Agostinho Neto, in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Savimbi turned out to be more of a zealous pit bull on the campaign trail than the charismatic figure his supporters had been expecting.  He often harangued his audiences, using appeals to racial and ethnic differences rather than the calls for national unity he had so often voiced on his overseas forays. The result was to send potential backers running reluctantly to dos Santos and the ruling MPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In stark contrast, dos Santos assumed a kinder, gentler approach.  Using the same Rio-based public relations firm that engineered the victory of Fernando Collor de Mello in Brazil last year, dos Santos presented himself as a quiet, humble family man. He stressed national reconciliation and the promise of lasting peace for a war-weary people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi also may have been hurt by controversy over Unita's human rights record, sparked by the defections earlier this year of former Unita foreign minister, Antonio da Costa Fernandes, and top military commander Miguel N'zau Puna. Charging that Savimbi ordered the murders of some of Unita's most promising leaders, including a popular former Unita representative to Washington, Pedro &quot;Tito&quot; Chingunji, and his family, the defectors put Savimbi on the defensive both at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the reason, Savimbi never was able to capture the initiative in the campaign. What Unita thought would be a cakewalk to the presidency became a fight for political survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By August, dos Santos was able to stump across Angola's central highlands, the country's agricultural heartland and Savimbi's political and military stronghold. A better campaigner than anyone had suspected, dos Santos drew large crowds at rallies on what most had regarded as Unita's home turf.  When election day came, dos Santos had hit his stride and Savimbi appeared exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPLA took Hula, Moxico, Cunene and Namibe provinces and ran a respectable second in Benguela. It was a stunning rebuke delivered by a largely illiterate but determined electorate. After all, these were the areas where Unita had operated militarily, where it thought it had almost unanimous popular support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results were humiliating to an astonished Savimbi, who had convinced his supporters and himself that victory was assured. Before the polling, Savimbi predicted he would take all of the country's 18 provinces and 70% of the popular vote. Unita officials had projected sweeps of the crowded shantytowns that surround Angola's cities. But official results show Unita winning only four provinces and finishing second in 13 others. The margins of defeat were also surprisingly large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi is still playing to win. Since the outcome became clear, he has maneuvered frantically to regain lost ground. Operating from the central highland city of Huambo, Savimbi has received visiting would-be intermediaries, including South African Foreign Minister Roelof (Pik) Botha and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen. He has issued threats, and he has agreed to meetings with dos Santos and then failed to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has announced results showing dos Santos with a margin of victory just short of the 50% required to avoid a run-off, but agreement on holding a second round of voting has remained illusive. In the views of many observers, Angola is headed for a return to war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that happens, it will likely be a fight to the finish this time -- a winner-take-all proposition that would make the results of the country's first-ever democratic elections a mere footnote to continued decades of armed conflict. It is not what the Angolan people want, that is very clear. But it may happen.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cindy Shiner * Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is any doubt whether Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny still has fans after holding power longer than any other African head of state, just ask Bakary Kone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kone traveled three hours from Abidjan to Yamoussoukro on October 18 to wish Houphouet-Boigny a happy birthday and personally deliver a gift he said took him nine months to make and cost him $ 1,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to tell him I am content with him and I am devoted to him,&quot; said the 28-year-old artist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against the backdrop of the massive Roman Catholic basilica that Houphouet-Boigny built to rival St. Peter's in Rome, Kone and a colleague pushed the gift -- a wooden statue of a seated Houphouet-Boigny with two small elephants at his feet -- in a wheelbarrow. They were on their way to the presidential residence in Yamoussoukro because authorities would not allow them to present the gift at the basilica, where the president was attending mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The service was a special mass held to mark Houphouet-Boigny's 87th birthday, although he is believed to be older. He is also thought to be the world's oldest president, as well as Africa's longest-serving head of state, having been in power since 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born the son of a chief in Yamoussoukro, Houphouet-Boigny was a prosperous farmer and rural doctor for almost 20 years. In 1946, as he organized opposition to French colonial rule, he added &quot;Houphouet,&quot; meaning &quot;battering ram,&quot; to his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has compared himself to a crocodile because he says he sleeps with his eyes open, but there is nothing vicious about his demeanor. A small man with gnome-like features, he had an aide lift him slightly off the marble floor in front of the basilica so he could wave to fans over the roof of his limousine. Followers chanted &quot;Houphouet! Houphouet!&quot; as he drove away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long-standing rulers in other African countries are not always received with such warmth. When Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko showed up unannounced for the funeral of the leader of the country's Kibanguist church in Kinshasa, critics lined the road yelling &quot;hibou! hibou!&quot; It is the French word for &quot;owl,&quot; but it also has the derogatory meaning &quot;night-prowler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Houphouet-Boigny is not without his critics. In 1990, the president was forced by opposition demands to end one-party rule. He was easily reelected in a vote his main rival charged was rigged, but most observers said the aging head of state was the clear winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the elections, however, discontent has mounted. The opposition newspaper Ivoire Soir carried a headline Sunday reading, &quot;Happy Birthday, Papa Houphouet-Boigny! But your country is going down the drain!&quot; The phrase, &quot;going down the drain&quot; is a polite translation of the French slang that actually was printed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leaders blame the president for the collapse of the country's economy, once considered the miracle of sub-Saharan Africa. Prices for Cote d'Ivoire's chief exports, cocoa and coffee, have plummeted in the past decade. In the last two years, as inflation has risen and subsidies for services such as education have been slashed, there have been periodic street demonstrations demanding that the president resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Houphouet-Boigny also has been heavily criticized for building the basilica, which cost about $ 200 million, while the country went into an economic tailspin. The president says the project cost only half that much and was built with his own money.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cindy Shiner * Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegations of fraud in Cameroon's first democratic presidential election have thrust the central African country into renewed political turmoil, while its president of ten years appears poised for a new term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leaders have accused the government of President Paul Biya of rigging the October 11 elections, and U.S. observers said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; with the conduct of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court rejected petitions by the opposition to annul the elections and the government has recalled its envoy to the United States, accusing Washington of meddling in Cameroon's internal affairs. Although they were not invited by the Cameroon government, 19 observers from the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs monitored the elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 21, the leading opposition candidate John Fru Ndi said an unofficial count of returns by his own Social Democratic Party showed that he had won more votes than the president. &quot;Let the Biya regime know that we are ready to fight to the last man to ensure that our victory is not stolen,&quot; he warned in what he called a &quot;victory speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government court put Biya ahead of Fru Ndi by about 200,000 votes, out of 2.8 million votes cast. Neither candidate claimed to receive over 50% of the ballot, but election rules say the top vote getter can win with less than a majority. All results remained unofficial pending confirmation by the Supreme Court on October 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, angry opposition party officials withdrew from the vote commission to protest the government court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The results they are going to announce have already been decided,&quot; said Dorothee Kom, spokeswoman for Fru Ndi. &quot;It is only a masquerade.'' She accused the government of loading the commission in its favor, giving 11 of the 13 seats to representatives from Biya's southern home region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state-run media contend the voting was fair and quoted U.S.  observers as saying they were satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the leader of the observer mission, James Tierney, denied the report. Among irregularities the group cited were Biya's hasty calling of the election, the government's refusal to reopen voter registration, last-minute changes to electoral laws to favor Biya and questionable validity of some voting cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers also said the government monopolized the official media for its campaign. They cite the example that Biya used 142 minutes of air time on the eve of the election, although all five opposition candidates had only 12 minutes combined. Biya also broadcast a campaign speech in French and English -- Cameroon's official languages -- the Sunday morning of the election when campaigning officially ended at midnight Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the elections, Biya was embarrassed by the resignation of one of his ten provincial governors. George Achu Mofor, the brother of Biya's prime minister, quit as governor of the eastern province, charging that members of the ruling party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement, pressured him to falsify results. He also criticized the government's human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameroon is among dozens of African nations whose governments have yielded to cries for democracy over the past three years by legalizing opposition parties, holding national conferences or scheduling elections. The ethnically and ecologically diverse country is a microcosm of the continent, and its neighbors look to Cameroon for clues as to what they themselves could face as they prepare for the first free votes in their own countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameroon has colonial ties to Germany, France and Britain and is home to at least 200 separate ethnic groups, each with its own language. But within that diversity are divisions that prevented the opposition from uniting behind one candidate and consolidating its power against Biya. Five opposition candidates competed against him in the race for the presidency, and others dropped out at earlier stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some opposition leaders called for a boycott of March's legislative elections, but not all of Biya's opponents followed suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya's two leading contenders were Fru Ndi, a 51-year-old bookstore owner, and Bello Bouba Maigari, 46, who once served as prime minister under Biya. Fru Ndi comes from English-speaking western Cameroon, and Maigari is popular in his native, and largely Muslim, north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya was forced to legalize opposition parties last year after strikes and unrest left dozens dead. However, he refused to allow installation of a transitional government to oversee the election process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president was not always so controversial. Cameroonians cheered him when he succeeded authoritarian President Ahmadou Ahidjo in 1982 and promised to bring democracy. But his popularity began to decline after he cracked down on dissent following a 1984 coup attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further damaging his image were the country's economic woes. Economic growth had averaged eight percent into the 1980s, but world market prices for Cameroon's oil, cocoa, coffee, cotton and timber tumbled, and by 1988 the gross domestic product was falling as well. More than one-quarter of Cameroon's workforce was unemployed last year.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1760 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Karen Gellen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Verde's energetic new prime minister says his island nation is on the move economically, fueled by the heady air of democracy. Carlos Veiga, 41, describes with palpable pride Cape Verde's bloodless transition to multiparty rule and the popular energy and international financial support he says the process has unleashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elected last December with an overwhelming majority of the vote, Veiga's government has moved quickly to promulgate a new constitution and dismantle the apparatus that gave the previous ruling party a hammerlock on the country's economic, political and cultural life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veiga, a former attorney general under the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde, known as the PAICV, which had ruled since independence, is president of the Movement for Democracy. Founded in 1989, the opposition party won 56 seats in the 79-member National Assembly in the December vote and captured the presidency in February 1992 elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an October conversation, while visiting Cape Verdean communities in several U.S. cities, Veiga talked about the heritage of single-party rule and the sweeping changes under way in his West African country, which is about the size of Rhode Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AfricaNews: How have elections changed Cape Verde?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veiga: The change has been fundamental: today we have complete freedom of the press and of political association. There are actually more newspapers in opposition than in support of our government. The political police and people's tribunals are gone, and the new constitution guarantees free elections, multiple trade unions and the full range of democratic guarantees.  You can feel in the air a real environment of freedom and liberty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Is that change reflected in the economy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veiga: Definitely. We're making very deep reforms to enable a shift to a market economy -- from privatizing the public sector to liberalizing foreign trade. We have instituted bank reform. Currently there is only one state bank, but we are open to new national and foreign banks. There is now the legal framework that will allow private interests to take root in a strong way, especially in the key areas of tourism, fisheries and international services, such as transport and telecommunications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: What conditions gave rise to the Movement for Democracy, and why was there such a strong consensus for political reform?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veiga: Single-party rule had caused economic strangulation and social corrosion. The weight of the state on the society undermined positive values like hard work, initiative and creativity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system used social engineering to manacle the individual, so they could only express themselves with the imposed ideological line. I have personal experience with this: I became a member of parliament under the previous regime, joining the single electoral list because many people had asked me to run. During my term I found it increasingly difficult to express my views. I became completely isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can't compare this to a place like Romania in terms of repression, but there was no right to political association other than in the so-called mass organizations of the party. That control was enforced by people's militias scattered throughout the country and by people's tribunals and neighborhood commissions that were extensions of the political police. The system made people passive. It robbed the society of its dynamism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: How did an idealistic liberation movement, founded by an African hero like Amilcar Cabral, end up creating what you describe as an instrument of oppression?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veiga: We have to acknowledge that the PAICV worked hard and that corruption never reached the levels we see in other countries. But independence leaders such as Cabral and Angola's Agostino Neto became politically conscious in the environment of the clandestine opposition to the Portuguese dictatorship. That movement was dominated by the Communist Party, which had experience in the underground and viewed its enemy as Western imperialism. Thus the Eastern bloc model prevailed when the liberation movements came to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cape Verde the anti-democratic seeds were planted even before independence. We were supposed to have multi-party elections for an assembly that would write a constitution within three months of independence. But the liberation movement exercised strong pressure to prevent other parties from forming, and it ran alone. It then took five years, instead of three months, to pass a constitution. During that time, the ruling party organized itself and the society so it could exert total control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: How will your government ensure that the new free-market system does not bring the negative aspects we've seen in some other formerly socialist countries?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veiga: We do not defend pure and absolute liberalism. We believe the state should have a role in protecting workers, women, young people and the elderly. Those goals are clearly defined in our economic strategy. We believe that private enterprise will result in social progress. All conditions are in place for success, and we expect rapid change during this first term of our legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Some African countries making similar democratic changes say they are being left in the lurch by the developed countries. Are you optimistic about receiving international aid and investment to back up your programs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veiga: Our country is so small that what is considered inadequate or marginal for other countries is enough to achieve the results we want. We haven't had difficulties getting support for our projects. Our main problem is the internal capacity to absorb this external aid. But we are creating that capacity, which will eventually enable us to have an economy that is minimally self-sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank, a very demanding organization, analyzed our program and agreed with it. The bank is supporting us in programs we consider financially significant and fundamental to our development. And the countries we have economic relations with have expressed the same optimism. At a round-table meeting in Geneva this month, we presented our economic plan to our main bilateral and multilateral partners -- these include Sweden, the United States, Germany, Portugal, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the World Bank, the African Development Bank and many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Geneva, we obtained a consensus, an agreement that they will support us. A second session will take place in November in Praia, our capital, so that these contributions will be organized and integrated into our economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Currently, more Cape Verdeans live abroad than at home -- 600,000, throughout the world, including 300,000 in the United States compared to the 400,000 in Cape Verde itself. Do those communities maintain links with their homeland?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veiga: My visit here is specifically to meet with the Cape Verdeans in the New England states, here in New York, in Washington, DC, and in California. These communities keep strong cultural and political ties to Cape Verde. In fact, the first nucleus of opposition to the one-party system came from Cape Verdeans abroad, who were exposed to alternative ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Verdeans abroad make a strong financial contribution to our economy: the remittances they send to their relatives at home make up 45% in foreign currency of our imports. The communities outside also play a direct political role. My party pressed to have representatives from those communities in our parliament, and the new constitution provides for a doubling of their seats in the future. They will also have the right to vote in our next presidential election. The Movement for Democracy has received strong moral support from Cape Verdeans here, but we don't accept any financial contributions from outside. The PAICV did accept money from abroad, and it gave the party a very bad image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Does your new economic plan contain measures aimed at stemming such large-scale emigration?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veiga: The emigration has both positive and negative aspects. It is negative because so much of our youth has to leave the country to find jobs.  And Cape Verdeans have been forced out over the centuries by drought and famine that decimated the islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there has always been a positive side as well: a spirit of adventure that is very deep in our culture. Living on small islands surrounded by a vast sea can sometimes feel like a prison, and there is an intense desire to learn about the world outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope by the next generation Cape Verdeans won't have to leave home for economic reasons. But our spirit of adventure will remain. And even when Cape Verde becomes a developed country, many of our people will still go out and explore the world. *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greetings to all of you from the traditional Presbyterian stronghold of Agona Nsaba, site of the 63rd Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana (PCG), to which I am a delegate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 63rd Synod is being held in the very large Presbyterian Church of Nsaba, a structure capable of seating the 600-odd delegates without difficulty. There are a handful of female pastors and 200 lay people -- perhaps 560 men and 40 women. There are a handful of female pastors, one of whom gave the devotional this morning. But the overriding impression is that the PCG is governed by men -- black men. Mine is the only white face in the crowd.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the bulk of the synod is devoted to church affairs, there have been moments in which other concerns came to light. One such moment was the appearance of Albert Adu Boahen, presidential candidate of the Patriotic Party. Yes, this is election year in Ghana, signaling the end of some 11 years of military rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boahen, appearing before the synod &quot;as a member of the Presbyterian Church and not as a presidential candidate,&quot; called on the officers of the country to exercise &quot;humility and accountability.&quot; The moderator of the synod, the highest officer of the PCG, expressed hopes of a peaceful transfer to the &quot;Fourth Republic&quot; -- the fourth elected government of post-colonial Ghana -- warning that should the specter of military coup again raise its ugly head, the people of Ghana should resort to civil disobedience -- a remark greeted with hefty applause by the synod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though we find ourselves in a good place in Ghana these days, we also see that for many Ghanaians, it's a hard place. This year is a year of climatic disturbance. The rainy season, of vital importance to the nation's agriculture, has more or less not taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tamale area is particularly dry, worse than most other areas. When visiting villages these days, I sense a spirit of quiet desperation. Where is the rain? Rain callers, for the price of a sheep, are willing to do their best to rectify the situation. They are quite busy this year, to no avail. I also am perceived as someone who might know how to call rain. Thus the offerings at our worship services are running higher than usual, and the prayer request is always the same: &quot;Pastor, pray for rain. You pray for us.&quot; And I do, but it doesn't rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many younger people have been sent south by their parents to look for work. Driving south to the synod, I happened to meet some of them in Kintampo, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) south of Tamale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you get work?&quot; No work. They said they were hoping to hear of rain in Tamale; then they would go back. How I would have liked to have obliged them with the good news: &quot;It's raining.&quot; But that would have been nothing but a cruel joke. I fear we are headed for a crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is it that Africa must lurch from one crisis to the next? If there should be no harvest in Germany this year, food would be bought on the world market, the shelves in the supermarket would be full, and most people would never know the difference. Here, children will lie awake at night with empty stomachs, too weak to cry, staring at their parents with wide hungry eyes, their parents at wits' end to know what to do. There is no justice. None whatsoever. None.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was my good fortune to be invited to a conference in the United States this summer, giving me opportunity to visit at home for the first time since 1989. But the United States seemed strange after so many years away. The roadside, so lively in Ghana, and once certainly also in the United States, was entirely given over to concrete and cars. Where were the sidewalk vendors with their &quot;fast food&quot; -- I mean the fresh bananas, the oranges already sliced and peeled, the hot corn on the cob, the hard-boiled eggs, the freshly pounded fufu, the roasted groundnuts wrapped in old newspaper? That's the fast food in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fast food in the United States? Well, yes, hamburgers and fried chicken and what have you, sold not at the roadside but in neatly appointed stores with easy, drive-in access. But whether you eat it there or take it with you, you get it wrapped and rewrapped and even boxed up and put into a bag, so that the event at hand, consumption of food, must always be preceded by much unbagging, unboxing, unwrapping, unpacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once down to the food, you may decide it needs a bit of seasoning. No problem. Handy packages of ketchup, mustard, salt and pepper are everywhere.  Unpack and season to taste. And then all the packaging must be thrown away -- waste, useless, good for nothing, fuel for the incinerator. Why, when it could be so much more simple -- and is nearly everywhere in the world but in the United States?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And where were the people? Always inside. Inside their houses, inside their cars, inside their offices, inside, inside. Looking down the street, I saw nothing but cars, buildings, concrete. No people. I found myself homesick for the crowded street life in Ghana: people on every corner, people walking, people on bicycles, people carrying water, people carrying their goods to market and home again; people also in cars, but always cars chock full of people, none of this one-person-one-car solitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I've been away a long time. Although there's no place like home, I'm not sure I'll ever fit in again.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Zaring for Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A conflict between the state-owned People's Daily Graphic and its government-appointed board of directors has turned into a significant victory for Ghana's recently deregulated press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Graphic, Ghana's largest daily, with a circulation of 100,000, was ordered by its directors on September 25 to transfer 11 journalists to and from new administrative posts and regional desks. The journalists concerned, including two feature editors, a news editor and a popular columnist, are noted for what the Morning Sun, an independent Ghanaian weekly, called &quot;their outspokenness and criticism of some of the policies of the Provisional National Defense Council&quot; (PNDC), the country's unelected ruling body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Graphic staff vigorously protested the order, first by wearing red armbands in support of the 11 transferees and then by petitions and editorials condemning the directors. The editors charged that the transfers were designed to provoke &quot;open confrontation with the editorial board to cripple its initiative and resourcefulness.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looking at the caliber of the staff the board of directors is transferring out, the editorial board is left with no other choice than to conclude that this is a deliberate attempt to disintegrate the editorial department,&quot; the editors protested in a letter to the Graphic directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These complaints were supported in a resolution passed by the Ghana Journalists Association and by what Frankie Asare-Donkoh, one of the affected journalists, describes as &quot;the spontaneous support (for the Graphic staff) shown by the public nationwide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The telephone calls, letters, personal calls, and articles condemning the board's action were just innumerable,&quot; says Kwaku Bakla, another transferee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 6, the board of directors called for a truce and a series of meetings with Graphic editors, and the next day the board rescinded the transfer directive. Asare-Donkoh calls the reversal an &quot;overwhelming victory for objective journalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kwesi Yankah, editor-in-chief of Uhuru, a weekly Ghanaian news magazine, agrees. &quot;When suddenly this happened at the Graphic, one clearly saw it as an attempt to draw us back to the old days of Ghanaian journalism where the press was directly controlled by the government,&quot; he says. &quot;I think that the reaction of the Graphic and the public is very good news for the press. It augurs well for the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the victory of the Graphic reporters had a price. The paper was forced to adopt a series of political reporting guidelines, sponsored by the board, that limits media coverage to those parties registered by the government and those holding police permits for meetings. Sam Clegg, editor-in-chief of the Graphic, says adoption of the guidelines was a necessary compromise to avoid further confrontation with the board of directors over the transferal issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's press has coped with censorship since 1963, when the country's first newspaper licensing law curbed criticism of then head-of-state Kwame Nkrumah. The PNDC, during its 11-year rule of the country, has banned one newspaper, the Chronicle Standard, has detained some journalists without trial and has forced other reporters into exile. In 1989, the PNDC capped its efforts to control the Ghanaian press with a new newspaper licensing law, granting Secretary of Information Kofi Totobi Quakyi the power to &quot;revoke or suspend such licenses as he deems fit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law was revoked last year in preparation for national elections and a transition to civilian rule. Over 30 newspapers, most of them four-page broadsheets, have begun publishing since the restrictions were lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the current climate of democratization, the Graphic has sought to distance itself from its traditional editorial stance of uniform support for the policies of its government owners, claiming that a newly objective approach would win the paper more readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People had come to associate journalists with a fanatic and fundamentalist support of the government,&quot; it editorialized. &quot;We have managed to extricate ourselves from those entanglements.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1454 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gaborone, Botswana</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Warren</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans to complete a buffalo fence around Africa's last great wilderness, the Okavango Delta in Botswana, have caused a storm of protest from environmentalists and local people who cannot agree on its site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At issue is the Okavango Delta itself -- 5,800 square miles (15,000 square kilometers) of unique wetland and the world's largest inland waterway.  The area supports a greater diversity of animals than virtually anywhere else on earth due to the concentration of habitats ranging from Kalahari sands, lagoons and forest and scrub, flood plain, and reed bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fence -- five strands of wire and one line of steel cable capable of withstanding a lateral impact of 25 tons (enough to stop a charging buffalo but not an elephant) -- loops around the delta to the south and aims to close in the top before swinging on a meandering course up to Botswana's northern border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its ostensible purpose is to prevent contact between the buffalo of the delta, which carry foot-and-mouth disease, and Botswana's 3 million cattle. But its opponents see many other reasons for its construction.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The installation of the first stage of the 140-mile (226-kilometer) northern buffalo fence has become a bitterly divisive issue among environmentalists, big game hunters, locals and the Botswanan government, oddly provoking accord in some cases between usually opposing groups all wanting to dismantle the four-foot-high fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The depth of the passion is due to cattle. Botswana is cattle country and &quot;buffalo fence&quot; is a misnomer for cattle fence. In an area of semi-arid grazing susceptible to seven-year drought cycles, the vast water resources pouring into the Okavango Delta have long been a source of dispute between cattle and wildlife -- a dispute temporarily settled in the wildlife's favor by the invasion of the area by the tsetse fly after 1825.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the country's cattle population at the limit of the land's capability to support it, the pressure on the delta as a wildlife and water resource is immense. For Botswana, cattle is big business. &quot;They are money in the bank as far as Botswanans are concerned,&quot; says Seeido Liphuko, the country's secretary of natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 684,000 of Botswana's 1.5 million people are involved with beef and a further 456,000 want to be. The result of such belief in cattle in Africa's most stable democracy is that &quot;cow power&quot; is an enormous political factor. It is also one that could be considerably amplified in the event of a drought, according to Rick Lomba, the fiercest and most vocal critic of Botswana's conservation policy and its plans for the delta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressure on the government to open up the Okavango is growing because the delta, whose headwaters are in Angola, where rains have been good, is at its highest level in 20 years. This has resulted in an almost mile-wide natural barrier to the cattle at a time when the rest of southern Africa is suffering a disastrous drought that is decimating Botswana's southern areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A U.S. citizen, filmmaker and conservationist living in South Africa, Lomba is a one-man crusade who lobbies the U.S. Congress and the European Community with his claims that Botswana intends to turn the delta into a giant ranch to the advantage of the cattle and to the detriment of the wildlife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lomba and his supporters, who maintain that the fence is ineffective because of the difficulty of maintaining it in a swamp and the problems of joining a section that runs through perennial marsh, want it removed while an independent environmental impact assessment examines its effects on wildlife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reception of Lomba's views in Washington and the European Community headquarters in Brussels has been sufficiently sympathetic to prompt the Botswana government to finance a fact-finding team to study placement of the fence as well as Lomba's claims that it prevents migration of wildlife and the traditional use of parts of the delta by hunter-gatherers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real bone of contention lies in the Selinda Valley. Inhabitants of the rapidly growing villages of Beetsha and Seronga, which lie 25 miles (40 kilometers) outside the fenced delta, claim they are being denied access to traditional grazing areas. Safari organizers and conservationists claim that an area of great importance to the ecology of the delta is being threatened.  Conspiracy theorists see a plot to provide cattle with access to 695 square miles (1,800 square kilometers) of land to the east of the Okavango River, giving commercial owners plentiful grazing along the banks and access to water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the fence has been given as many proposed routes as the Channel Tunnel rail link between Dover and London, with conservationists arguing for a more northerly line, cattle farmers arguing for its siting further south, and Lord Wilmot of the local safari lobby demanding that it include the whole Selinda Valley to protect the river from over-grazing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cattle can only travel a maximum of about 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) from a water source and their wide mouths consume vegetation that otherwise could support a great diversity of wildlife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists recognize that with a projected explosion in human population, demands on land will increase. What they don't accept is the government's interpretation of where these various interests can be separated.  According to the people of Seronga, they were consulted on the placing of the fence and then their views were ignored by the government. &quot;Visit the fence and you'll see destruction of giraffe and animals of the earth of all sorts,&quot; says one man, echoing the claims that the fence is interfering with wildlife migration routes -- a charge that the Wildlife Department denies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Seronga's villagers claim to understand the compromise and the need to conserve wildlife, they also hint at the political questions that lurk behind the issue of the fence. &quot;Because of our democratic tradition, we think it should be a decision of the majority that decides where this fence goes,&quot; says the local councilor. His colleague, the village chief, is similarly political in his response. &quot;All developments must look at the figures with regard to the population of people, wildlife and cattle. There should be a balance between us, but the balance should bear in mind our children and their need for space, for food and housing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Beesha, views on the fence are more forthright. An area which had reverted to hunting and gathering after the expansion of the tsetse fly, its people now participate in the cattle invasion which has pushed numbers from 3,000 to 15,000 in less than a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been oppressed by the government in the siting of this fence.  Most of the food that we gather is beyond the fence, so it is preventing us getting to it,&quot; says one resident. Among the chief criticisms of the Tshomarelo Okavango Conservation Trust is that fences create boundaries for people as well as animals. This point is conceded by Wildlife Director Nigel Hunter, although he maintains that rights laid out in the government's Land Use and Development Plan for the Okavango will solve the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another resident, who admits that he is a recent big cattle owner, stated the future pressures on the fence more clearly. &quot;I'm worried that the grazing land will decrease. We are not against wildlife, but what we are saying is give cattle a fair chance in the grazing area. If you make the decision to remove cattle from this area,&quot; he says, &quot;then you kill (my people).&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce Wallace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banking the seven-passenger plane into a steep descent to the seaside airstrip in Mogadishu, Somalia, our Libyan-born pilot, Tom, remarked that he was &quot;flying just a single Moga today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Translation: he was making just one return flight to Mogadishu from Nairobi, Kenya, with a cargo of medical supplies, relief workers and journalists entering the Somali nightmare. There are some days when the demand to get into Somalia is so great that Tom makes two trips -- &quot;a double Moga.&quot; Two trips with stopovers in the southern Somali city of Kismayu are &quot;a double Moga with cheese,&quot; in the daredevil pilot's language.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the world becomes more aware of the tragedy unfolding in Somalia, scores of aid workers and others are trying to get into the country at the same time that thousands of Somalis are fleeing war and famine for refugee camps in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the remarkable relief workers is Matthew Bryden, 24, a British-born political science graduate of McGill University in Montreal. He has worked in Somalia for three years and now coordinates logistics for the French humanitarian aid group Doctors Without Borders in Mogadishu. Bryden was working in northern Somalia earlier this year with a team of Dutch doctors who decided to pull out of the country rather than hire local armed guards for security. But Bryden instead moved to Mogadishu and joined a French team that was committed to staying. &quot;Walking away from this country is just not an option,&quot; he said. Bryden admits to mixed feelings about Somalis. &quot;Westerners find it difficult to like Somalis because they do not put on any pretense of being grateful that we are here,&quot; he said. &quot;But I really admire the toughness of these people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attraction of working in a country where inhumanity is on bald display daily is also hard for outsiders to grasp. Traveling anywhere requires hiring local armed security staff, or &quot;technicals&quot; as they are called. The best squads use four-wheel drive Land Rovers and have their men, Kalashnikov and M-16 rifles at the ready, positioned in the seats and on the roof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A team of technicals costs about $ 180 a day, not including gas, to provide protection in the countryside. But the price of all services, including technicals, began to climb when the United States began airlifting aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBS News's medical reporter, Robert Arnot, arrived with his roller blades in the hope of getting in some exercise -- a stark impossibility on Mogadishu's battered and murderous streets. Other new arrivals were better prepared. A photographer for the Swedish Red Cross showed up at the Kenyan border town of Liboi with a black studio backdrop to take pictures for a fund-raising campaign for Somali relief. For about three dozen filthy, hungry Somali refugees crossing the border checkpoint, their first experience in Kenya was to be led in front of a photographer's backdrop in the middle of a desert and told how to pose for a portrait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other regular visitors to Somalia now are a half dozen Kenyans who fly tiny Cessna planes crammed with bags of the leafy, and legal, drug called khat into the famine-stricken country. Even before the sun is up, Nairobi's Wilson Airport is swarming with Kenyans and local Somalis involved in the drug trade, which produces a profit of about $ 12,000 on each flight.  Somalis are huge consumers of khat, but they do not grow the plant. The khat flights are the first planes off the ground each morning, often so grossly overloaded that they require double the normal amount of runway to get airborne. By mid-afternoon, Somalis who can afford it are chewing the plant, which heightens the user's energy levels and dulls the sensation of hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strangeness of the war-ravaged country is only heightened by the presence of the drugs. Street scenes seem to have emerged from a special effects laboratory for post-apocalyptic science fiction. In the southern town of Baidoa, Land Rovers roar through the streets, their well-armed and well-fed teenage passengers in &quot;I'm The Boss&quot; T-shirts pushing skeletal adults out of the way. Among themselves, the teenagers wield their guns like fists, jabbing each other with the muzzles in the manner of a friendly punch. &quot;I really like my work,&quot; says Omar Abdi Farrah, who hires himself out as a translator to Westerners. &quot;But I don't know how long I can go on worrying about the security,&quot; he says. &quot;If you play with a bee long enough, it will sting you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the end, it is the hungry and the weak that you remember most about Somalia, because there are so many of them. In Baidoa, a city that is now nothing more than a cemetery for the dead and nearly dead, it is impossible to look anywhere without seeing people suffering.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of other women with babies and children lined up behind Ellesa as water trickled hesitantly through the outdoor tap.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been no reports of starvation deaths in South Africa, but malnutrition is on the rise and some 2 million people need food aid. Critics say the government's bureaucratic inefficiency and a lack of interest in the problem have caused it to be slow in helping impoverished rural blacks who have no political clout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How long can these people survive on just radishes and cabbage?&quot; asks the Rev. E. Daniel Sebe, who is conducting a drought survey for World Vision in the northeastern Transvaal province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black farm workers evicted from white-owned farms have formed squatter settlements on open patches of land throughout the countryside. No factory jobs exist. The mines are not hiring and rural villagers cannot sell their livestock because prices have fallen so low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dependent on what they can grow, rural South Africans must contend with failed crops and reduced surface water. South Africa's corn harvest was down by 60% this year, forcing the former exporter to import almost 4.5 millions tons from the United States and other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who can afford food often lack the water needed to cook it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though they can buy mealie meal (corn meal), they say they may not eat for two or three days because there isn't water,&quot; says Star Motswege, a field worker for the Transvaal Rural Action Committee (Trac).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first signs of potential drought came in September 1991, says Mpho</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mashinini, the deputy director of Operation Hunger, a private South African aid group. Yet the government only began addressing the problem in February 1992, when it voted to allocate $ 155 million to drought relief that has benefited mostly white farmers, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's quite difficult to understand why that money wasn't used earlier. The government took too long to respond,&quot; says Trac's Motswege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials deny those charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One can't say the government in September should have known there would be a drought,&quot; says Mike Walters, executive secretary of the government's Drought Action Coordinating Center. Walters says the first conclusive indications of a crisis was the failure of the main seasonal rains in January and February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics counter that when the government did act, it channeled aid to white farmers rather than to the more vulnerable blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most Afrikaaner farmers were helped first,&quot; says Mashinini. &quot;They were told to help their workers. But most of those black workers are now living in squatter camps because the farmers fired them instead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government concedes that of the 26,000 farmers being given drought assistance, most are white. But Walters says that rural black farmers have received $ 46 million in government aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aid to farmers is irrespective of race. Black farmers in South Africa are entitled to the same money,&quot; says Walters. &quot;But there aren't too many of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies say that most of the drought relief money earmarked for black farm workers never reaches those for whom it is intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some areas you find that the white farmers are the chairmen of the committees for allocating drought relief money. That itself means that a lot of people may be overlooked,&quot; says Motswego. &quot;Most whites in the countryside aren't very sympathetic to blacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hardest hit parts of south Africa are the rural reserves that were established under apartheid policy to divide black South Africans by ethnic group. More than 5 million people were forcibly moved from areas set aside for whites into the reserves, which were dubbed &quot;homelands.&quot; After years of being starved for resources, the areas suffer from impassable roads and nonfunctioning wells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overseas engineers, brought in to help drill new water holes, have withdrawn from the government's Water Task Force, according to Len Abrams, director of the Consultative Forum on Drought. Abrams says the engineers believe the scope of the crisis can be blamed more on &quot;long-term problems of neglect&quot; rather than &quot;emergency conditions brought about by drought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walters defends the government's drought-relief efforts, saying that drilling rigs have a hard time reaching the communities that need water because of the deterioration of homeland roads and the ruggedness of the terrain, particularly in the worst-affected areas in the northeast of the country. The government has drilled 35 well holes in Venda since the beginning of August and has nine rigs operating in the northern Transvaal, Walters says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our suppliers assure us there is enough food,&quot; says Operation Hunger's Mashinini. &quot;South Africa, unlike other countries, could reduce the effects of the drought if there were coordination between the government and the aid agencies. If hunger wasn't being used as a political weapon, we could cope.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cape Verde Envoy Casts A Long Shadow:Boutros-Ghali's Controversial Plan for Angola Deflected</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2800 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Karen Gellen * Africa News Service When a hitch in the Angolan election process placed yet another crisis at the doorstep of the United Nations in early October, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali went before a closed session of the Security Council with a novel idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with threats of renewed fighting by opposition leader Jonas Savimbi and the prospect of a costly extension of the UN's 600-person observer mission in Angola, Boutros-Ghali urged the Council to press the Angolan government to appoint Savimbi vice president. Such a move, the UN chief argued, might avert further conflict and forestall the need for a run-off election between Savimbi and the incumbent President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who led the official vote tally but lacked the majority needed to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response that scuttled the proposal came from one of the world's smallest nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Jose Luis Jesus of Cape Verde, which holds one of the rotating seats on the 15-member Council, denounced the idea as a circumvention of the democratic process. Abandoning his usual cautious approach, he made what UN sources say was an impassioned, impeccably argued speech that &quot;blew the plan away.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rallied by the ambassador's plea, the Council unanimously expressed its confidence in the peace process and named Jesus (pronounced Zhay-zoos) to lead a four-person mediation team to Angola. When the delegation returned to UN headquarters in late October, U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins, a member of the mission, praised Jesus for exemplary diplomacy, saying he had played a critical role as the team's spokesman and leader. While in Angola, the group worked to persuade both sides to negotiate conditions for a run-off vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In UN hallways, meanwhile, where word of the secretary-general's controversial stand quickly circulated, several diplomats from developing countries expressed pride -- and some surprise -- at the decisive role one of their number had assumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Ambassador Jesus, however, &quot;the role one can play in the United Nations is not predicated on the number of trees in your country's backyard. My country's size has never dictated our capacity to deal with the issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diplomat's homeland is a series of 10 tiny islands plus five islets dotting the Atlantic Ocean, 310 miles off Africa's western coast. Home to less than 350,000 people, and smaller than the state of Delaware, the former Portuguese colony has stretches of barren land that evoke the image of a moonscape. In February 1991, a Cape Verde opposition party defeated the party that had ruled since independence in 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tall and graceful, the 41-year-old Jesus cuts a striking figure in UN corridors. Although he is preoccupied by the economic disparities between the wealthy northern hemisphere and the poor nations of the south, he is outspoken on what he sees as his own continent's mistakes and false priorities. He insists on holding African leaders accountable for what he terms a &quot;shameful&quot; record of governance since decolonization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he puts his highest hopes in a new generation of leaders, who are emerging as African countries adopt multiparty political systems. This generation, he says approvingly, is the first not saddled by historical links to the liberation movements that brought many countries to independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those movements, the ambassador says, established a tradition of single-party rule &quot;that has been a disgrace all over the world, but especially in Africa.&quot; He acknowledges that Africa's problems are multifaceted. But single-party systems, he says, &quot;have been an important factor in the decline and misery of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus believes that one-party rule, &quot;privileges not the most competent people, but those who belong to the party or have connections with people in high party positions.&quot; he says that the spread of democracy &quot;will go a long way toward restoring Africa's credibility and prestige.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the hardship and repression that occur in developing countries that have a tradition of multiparty elections, Jesus argues that pluralism is a &quot;necessary, but not sufficient&quot; condition for progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cites, as an example, the international scandal in early September over the transport of toxic waste from Europe to war-torn Somalia. Cape Verde, Jesus says, &quot;would never accept such dumping, which can only take place in countries with dictatorships. No democratic regime, where the people have control over the political system, would accept being the garbage can of another country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus rejects the view that poor countries must choose between rapid development and a clean environment. Nor does he think that Africa must remain underdeveloped to compensate for the environmental destruction already caused by industrialization in northern countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is totally unacceptable,&quot; he says, &quot;for those who have developed at the cost of everyone else, to deny others the possibility of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Rio conference on the environment in June, delegates were looking for a balance, he says. Poor countries acknowledge that the process of industrialization changes the atmosphere. But they give rich countries a clear message: 'You who have developed by damaging everyone's good environment will have to come up with the financial means to ensure that in developing our countries we don't further destroy the atmosphere.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus says poor countries must refuse to become a kind of &quot;lung&quot; for the world. &quot;In Rio,&quot; he says, &quot;we told the developed countries that if they want us to curb our emissions, they have to come up with the money to help us buy the new technology, to transfer that technology to us. &quot;If the developed world does not provide those funds, it will suffer the consequences because the poorer countries will use classical, environmentally unsafe means to develop.  We cannot escape the popular pressure for development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ambassador is pessimistic that wealthy nations will respond in time to prevent further environmental deterioration. &quot;The North,&quot; he says, &quot;won't be motivated to take such measures unless they see more concrete damage. The day they see rashes and cancers on their skin, they will take action to clean up the environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observes ruefully that moral arguments have failed to spur action.  &quot;Money is only given out when there is a vested interest,&quot; he says, &quot;and that sense of urgency is not yet here. We will see a lot more destruction before anything changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While presiding over the Security Council in the monthly rotation of the chair last July, Ambassador Jesus confronted the potentially explosive issues of Somalia and Bosnia. He agrees with critics that the world community's response to the crisis erupting in Europe was far greater than to the one unfolding in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN operation in Somalia was thwarted for nearly five months by the opposition of one faction in the conflict,&quot; Jesus says, He says he strongly opposed Boutros-Ghali's decision to delay deployment of the armed guards until all the Somali factions gave their consent.  &quot;I would have deployed the UN force despite this opposition, &quot; he says, &quot;because I could not accept that millions would die if we did not act quickly.&quot; He says he would have provided &quot;necessary massive force&quot; to protect relief personnel. The wait spelled death on a massive scale, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council first addressed the Somali crisis in January, when it agreed to send a technical team to assess how to restore and prevent mass starvation. Four months later, on April 24, the 15 members agreed &quot;in principle&quot; to the dispatch of 500 armed guards to protect a large-scale food-distribution effort. But deployment of the guards was delayed, and the situation continued to deteriorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Council president, Jesus sponsored a provision in a resolution that required the UN to do everything necessary to make sure the food was delivered, even if all factions failed to cooperate. Amid rising public concern at the appalling news from Somalia, the UN approved the stronger stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the armed troops did not arrive in Somalia until late September, and an additional 3,000 guards recently authorized by the council are not yet on the ground. The long delay in providing security for the humanitarian effort has drawn scathing criticism from some African diplomats at the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN should have intervened, and I do not understand why they didn't,&quot; says Mohammed Sahnoun, the secretary-general's special envoy for Somalia. &quot;It was a very long delay and a tragic delay,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana's ambassador, Joseph Legwaila, is more blunt. The UN did not act until outside pressure became &quot;unbearable,&quot; he says, and then only with &quot;very reluctant, hesitant interest&quot; in the plight of the Somalis. Concerned African diplomats were forced into &quot;cajoling, praying, kneeling and groveling&quot; for Western aid, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legwaila says that while 20,000 UN and European Community troops have been deployed in the Balkans to guarantee humanitarian aid, Africans had to wage a &quot;war&quot; in the Security Council to obtain 500 guards for Somalia. &quot;Color,&quot; the ambassador argues,&quot; dulled some people's consciences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Council president, Ambassador Jesus was at the center of that diplomatic battle. Some closed-door council sessions reportedly became shouting matches as the African members -- Zimbabwe and Morocco, in addition to Cape Verde -- fought what they viewed as a double standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus says that even without UN action, individual nations could have sent planes &quot;to drop food and supplies as the European countries did in Bosnia, without any Security Council mandate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans at the UN remains dissatisfied with the world body's commitment in Somalia, says Jesus. There is still no massive infusion of humanitarian aid, nor adequate coordination of UN efforts, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political minefields confronting small, developing countries at the UN were also evident last March, when the United States and Britain asked the world body to impose sanctions on Libya. At issue was Tripoli's refusal to extradite two Libyan nationals accused by the U.S. and Britain of a direct role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Verde abstained on the sanctions vote, despite intense U.S.  pressure to approve the resolution. The final tally was 10 in favor, with five abstentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Jesus, the Security Council was not an appropriate venue for the extradition issue, and Cape Verde could not, in any case, press for Libyan compliance when its own constitution forbids such extradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another consideration, says Jesus, was African unity: in a controversial issue involving an African state, Cape Verde did not want to separate itself from the other African council members, both of which abstained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some African UN sources who decline to be identified view Cape Verde's vote &quot;courageous,&quot; given the strong U.S. interest in unanimity against Libya.  One diplomat says that Washington briefly suspended food aid to Cape Verde shortly after the vote. The aid now has been restored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus acknowledges that pressure is always a factor for developing countries, particularly those least able to &quot;bear the economic consequences&quot; of their votes. There are no direct threats, he observes, &quot;but you get the message.&quot; Nonetheless, he adds, countries such as his sometimes opt to take the heat when, as in the Libyan case, principle or regional loyalty are involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One other issue to which Jesus has devoted considerable attention is the negotiation of a &quot;Law of the Sea .&quot; The UN 's effort to reach agreement on the use and exploitation of the world's oceans has dragged on for more than a decade. The talks, like those on the environment, pit rich nations against poor ones, with poor countries arguing that oceans and their resources should be protected as a &quot;common heritage&quot; of all people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of the United Nations often cite the world body's failure, after years of discussion and a large expenditure of funds, to forge an agreement on the issue. The continuing dispute centers on UN efforts to regulate seabed mining. The U.S., other Western countries and Russia have refused to sign any treaty that restricts their access to ocean minerals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus accepts some of that criticism. The effort to &quot;internationalize&quot; the mineral wealth under the oceans was doomed from the start, he says. The idea was &quot;a theoretical construct that was simply not viable.&quot; But he points out that the bulk of the treaty has been endorsed by the entire UN membership.  The ambassador defends the notion that the international statecraft that often seems arcane to observers is nevertheless important to nations like his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people of my country &quot;are directly affected &quot; by UN actions on issues like war, peace and international security, he says. &quot;We can't have normal trade and develop our resources in an insecure world filled with conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he argues that adding Cape Verde's voice to the discussion makes the country more visible. &quot;When we discharge our functions in a very responsible way,&quot; he says, &quot;it creates a better image for our small African country. In the end that will create a better space for our own interests, such as trade and foreign investment, to be considered. Our diplomacy demonstrates that we will have an appropriate response to the security of investments and to international cooperation and friendship. This has a direct impact on our people's lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus also believes in regional cooperation and in alliances based on mutual interests. Some diplomats have called for disbanding the Non-Aligned Movement -- founded in 1955 by countries who sought independence from East/West spheres of influence. Jesus says the group should stay together, but that it needs a new agenda for a world without superpowers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most important role such an alliance can play,&quot; says the ambassador, &quot;is to help democratize its own member countries and foster respect for human rights. It will take time to convince the movement to shift its priorities,&quot; he acknowledges, &quot;but unless the developing countries take the lead in ensuring democracy, free speech and human rights, they will not have any credibility.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngungwe, Mozambique</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This account of a trip into Mozambican rebel territory appeared in the New Nation, a Johannesburg newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a year after its independence in June 1975, Mozambique was once again at war -- this time against dissident right-wing elements, former army personnel and a ragtag bunch of mercenaries recruited by the white rulers in what was then Rhodesia. The group, which grew into the Renamo rebel movement, was used to sow destruction across Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe in 1980, Mozambicans expected that peace and stability would be restored. This was not to be. The attacks continued from inside Mozambique.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1980s was a savage decade for the country. Millions died or were injured as the war intensified and became increasingly brutal. Renamo, backed by the South African Defense Force (SADF) and shadowy Western right-wing groups, launched a reign of terror against the Mozambican population -- burning crops, looting, raping, wiping out whole families, and press-ganging orphans as young as five into Renamo's army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The signing of a peace accord should be cause for jubilation for millions of Mozambicans who are scattered all over the country and the subcontinent, some without their children, their parents or their limbs. But whether peace can take root and flower in a country with the severe problems caused by the drought and the war is a question Mozambicans are pondering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About four hours after the cease-fire agreement was signed in Rome, New Nation visited Renamo general Vieira Chimuadza at his headquarters in Ngungwe near the Kruger National Park -- the largest Renamo base in southern Mozambique and the nerve center of military operations against government forces in the provinces of Inhambane, Gaza and Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chimuadza -- who claims to be a founding member of Renamo and third in the organization's hierarchy -- was surrounded by his lieutenants and several women and children, all talking about the signing of the peace pact. &quot;The accord has been signed,&quot; was the first thing he said as we shook hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chimuadza, 39, was born in Sofala province and joined Renamo in 1977, after fleeing from a Frelimo reeducation camp where he claims he was held after being caught listening to a Renamo radio station. He says he was then a standard six (eighth grade) student at the Missao Benedito Secondary School in Beira, Mozambique's central and second largest city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It troubled me, because I didn't kill anybody. I didn't steal anything. I thought it was better to join Renamo at once,&quot; he said, adding that he was in the company of several fellow detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was trained by the then Rhodesian army, and he says he began his operations in Manica province, which borders Zimbabwe. &quot;We would attack (government) installations and go back to Rhodesia,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before Zimbabwe became independent, he said, the headquarters of the rebel movement was transferred to Gorongosa, in Manica province, and the South African security establishment took control of the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chimuadza received additional training at an SADF base in Phalaborwa, South Africa. He was also trained in parachute jumping in Namibia, before that country's independence, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Renamo leader claimed that after leading successful battles, he was trusted by Renamo head Afonso Dhlakama to open a southern front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From his base in Manica, he fought his way through to Inhambane and Gaza provinces until he was able to open the Ngungwe base, northwest of Maputo, the capital, and about four miles (six kilo-meters) from the border with South Africa. Having opened the new base, his task was to fight government forces in Maputo province, as well as sabotage the southern railway link between Mozambique and Zimbabwe, the Limpopo line. He claimed that he performed his task with success and &quot;cleaned the area&quot; of government troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the war has now officially ended, the general is awaiting instructions on the demobilization of his soldiers and what to do with thousands of captives -- he referred to them as &quot;refugees&quot; -- that remain under his control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he is convinced that some of the members of his army will be given jobs in a future administration. &quot;That is what our leaders told us -- that (the government and Renamo) will demobilize some people and give them jobs and the remainder will jointly form the new army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chimuadza is confident that peace will endure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If our leaders have hugged each other as a sign of peace, we will follow their example.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that the government's decision to sign the accord signaled that it had been defeated. &quot;They have agreed to all that we wanted -- this is what we wanted,&quot; he insists. He dismissed suggestions that the severe drought had contributed to bringing the two parties to the negotiating table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he acknowledged that without the help of various agencies, including right-wing Western sympathizers and South African church and other groups, Renamo would have had problems continuing the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not deny that the South Africans, including the army, had given material support, but he refused to comment on the direct military help that was given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No. I can't comment on that. That is better known by my leaders. It is something only they can answer,&quot; he said.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The peace agreement signed by Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano and Renamo chief Afonso Dhlakama provides that Zimbabwean and Malawian troops stationed in Mozambique must be withdrawn immediately. Both government troops and Renamo soldiers will be regrouped into assembly points. Supervision of the cease-fire is the responsibility of a joint commission of the government and Renamo, with a small number of United Nations forces present in a monitoring role.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new national army is to be made up of 30,000 troops, half of them contributed by the government and half by Renamo, with training aided by personnel from Britain, France and Portugal. Mozambicans are concerned that recent episodes showing a lack of discipline within the government army, and Renamo's long history of brutality and terror, will be significant obstacles to establishing a military force capable of maintaining security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace accord provides that existing Mozambican laws and institutions will have authority over the entire country in the period before general elections. But the government has conceded that administrators in Renamo-controlled areas would be selected from among residents of those areas, who may be members of Renamo. The police and the Mozambican intelligence service will be overseen by two commissions, each including six representatives from the government and six from Renamo, and nine other citizens appointed by President Chissano after consultation with all political forces in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the peace process and the elections -- the latter expected to cost some $ 80 million -- will depend on good faith from both parties as well asinternational assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By last month, only 25 UN monitors and support personnel had arrived in Mozambique. Although there has been no decision yet on the total number of peacekeepers that will be authorized, there has been no proposal that begins to approach the commitment of personnel and budget allocated for Cambodia. With about half the number of people as Mozambique and less than a quarter of its area, Cambodia has a UN peacekeeping force of 22,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. State Department has expressed its view that the UN presence in Mozambique should be roughly the same as that in Angola -- less than 1,000 people, including both civilian and military personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the attempt to keep the Mozambique mission small is a gamble.  Relief agencies are warning that without urgent action to see that the cease-fire holds and to get food delivered, much of rural Mozambique could become as desperate as Somalia.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maqueze, Mozambique</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women and children in tattered rags emerge from the surrounding bush to watch as a Red Cross plane loads sacks of food from this Mozambique air base. Red Cross trucks shuttle back and forth across the sandy airstrip, filling the plane that will fly 62 miles (100 kilometers) north into an area held by the rebel movement Renamo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an old farm warehouse next to barracks for government troops, Red Cross aid worker Christopher Wieser has organized another food distribution, this one for people from nearby villages. &quot;We have to feed both sides,&quot; says Wieser, whose organization is the only group delivering food to Renamo territory.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of barefoot, dusty people stand in the shimmering heat in a line that snakes around the warehouse. A man with a stick makes sure the crowd stays orderly. Waiting children play a cat-and-mouse game with him, laughing as he chases them away. A small boy in the line wears blue rubber boots. Although there's been no rain, the soles protect his feet from the hot sandy soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women with babies strapped to their backs collect parcels that appear too heavy for them to manage on the long walks back to their homes. A few men wearing leather shoes stand alongside their wives and daughters, but even in those groups, women carry most of the loads. A blind woman with a walking cane hoists a bulging bag of corn meal onto her head without any assistance and heads back towards her village of Aito Changane, about a 5-mile (8-kilometer) walk away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most men are in the army, in South Africa or dead,&quot; says Wieser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 16-year war waged by the rebel movement has killed over a million people and wrecked the country's infrastructure. Farmers were forced off their land by looting and attacks from both Renamo and government troops. Migrant work in neighboring South Africa is one of the few ways to earn income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of Mozambique's people, a second year of drought has made an already desperate situation worse. Emergency food aid to the country has doubled this year. By the end of December, humanitarian groups expect to have distributed 400,000 tons of food to 3.1 million people, according to John Yale, director in Mozambique for World Vision, the California-based aid agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we speak, stocks are very low,&quot; says Joe Kessler of CARE, the U.S.  agency that has coordinated the Mozambican government's relief effort. &quot;But in the next five weeks, 160,000 tons are coming in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of an independent ability to sustain themselves has created almost total dependence on foreign aid. As though embarrassed by their plight, hungry people stream past aid workers, accepting their food parcels with barely a nod of acknowledgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people are ready to continue what they were doing before -- farming,&quot; says Felice Dindo, head of the International Red Cross operation in Mozambique. &quot;But this drought is pushing everyone to the cities.&quot; Shantytowns built of sugar cane have sprung up in every urban area where food may be available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dindo and other aid workers say that without the devastation from the war, most Mozambicans could have survived the drought. Being forced out of their villages means not being able to take advantage of any rains that come this year. &quot;It's useless to give people seeds when they have no fields,&quot; Dindo says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes the Red Cross center at Maqueze runs out of food before everyone receives a ration, but there are no signs of panic among those waiting their turn. People here, within reach of help, are among the fortunate ones in this war-ravaged land. &quot;They know there is food coming,&quot; says Wieser, who pays his employees food for their work. &quot;We'll probably run out today, but they know there will be more tomorrow.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jennifer Griffin for Africa News Service Maputo, Mozambique</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civilians are traveling again on Mozambique's main north-south highway, bringing coconuts and other goods to the capital. Leaders of the Renamo guerrilla movement, whose attacks once made the road impassable, now hold court in Maputo's beachfront bungalows, where they conduct poolside conversations with diplomats and journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourists are returning to the renovated Polana, the posh hotel of the colonial era, whose broad green lawns and imposing facade have been restored to their former grandeur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the thin veneer of normalcy that has returned to the city is patchy, at best, in outlying areas. Since an October 4 cease-fire, signed in Rome by the leaders of Renamo and the Mozambique government, Renamo forces in the north of the country have seized at least five towns. Two of them, including Angoche, a coastal city of 200,000 people, have been retaken by government troops.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each side accuses the other of starting the hostilities. Renamo says government soldiers were moving into territory Renamo held when the cease-fire was signed. &quot;We didn't violate the accord,&quot; says Laurencio Manque, a Renamo representative in Maputo. &quot;We were just defending ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government says Renamo is guilty of &quot;systematic violations&quot; of the accord as it tries to improve its position on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopes for a binding peace pact rest largely on United Nations special envoy Aldo Ajello, a 56-year-old Italian diplomat whose mission is responsible for organizing cease-fire committees, establishing assembly points for troops, and seeing that elections are held by next October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a tall order, as Ajello recognizes. He arrived here on cease-fire day with a contingent of 20 military observers, for a country about the size of Texas and Pennsylvania combined. The peace pact specified that government and Renamo troops would assemble at 49 points &quot;under the supervision and coordination of the United Nations&quot; within six days of the signing. But there are not enough UN monitors to have even one observer at each site. Questioned about the cease-fire breakdown, Ajello replies with a wry smile that &quot;the fighting is going very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, all the substantive issues of cease-fire implementation remain unresolved while the two sides bicker over housing arrangements for the Renamo negotiators who are due in Maputo. Anselmo Victor, the group's chief representative here, says the hotel rooms and the furnished, air-conditioned villas offered by the government are not good enough for Renamo leaders. He also says telephone services are inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not about housing,&quot; counters Mozambican Minister of Transport Armando Guebuze, who has been the government's top negotiator with the rebels.  &quot;The central problem,&quot; he says, &quot;is whether or not Renamo has decided to take any steps towards peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges and countercharges are reminiscent of 16 years of war since Renamo's founding by the white government of what was then Rhodesia, in retaliation for Mozambique's support of majority rule there. When Rhodesia became the independent nation of Zimbabwe, responsibility for Renamo shifted to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renamo now claims to be a self-reliant Mozambican group that is fighting for democracy. Internationally, as well as in Mozambique, that claim is viewed somewhat skeptically. The group's tactics of terror, intimidation and kidnapping have earned it a reputation for brutality on a massive scale. But the poorly trained and often unpaid soldiers of the government have committed atrocities of their own, according to human rights groups. Mozambique's 15.7 million people, mostly rural peasants, have been caught in the middle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their plight assumes a special urgency now, as a killing drought spreads across southern Africa. Although the region appears to have enough emergency food for at least the next few weeks, little can be delivered unless the cease-fire holds. An estimated 3 million people are totally dependent on food aid and may starve if the fighting continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several incidents since the cease-fire have called into question Renamo's ability to impose discipline over the ragtag bands of fighters who government officials dub &quot;bandits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last month, a group of foreign journalists tried to accompany a Red Cross food airlift to the Renamo-held village of Ndindiza in Gaza province, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) north of Maputo. Although the trip had the blessing of Renamo's Victor, the reporters spent three days sitting in sandstorms at a rural Gaza airstrip, waiting for approval from local Renamo commanders before giving up and returning to the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But amid the cease-fire violations, there have been some hopeful reports, especially from southern regions where the drought has hit hardest. In the town of Salamanga, for example, troops of both sides reportedly have been celebrating together, dancing and sharing beer and cigarettes. In the Gaza province town of Chipadja, Renamo soldiers emerged from the bush to request food from government soldiers, who gave them part of their own stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambique state radio reported that in the north, in Zambezia province, a Renamo unit stopped an army-escorted relief convoy to ask for food. When they were given a few bags of corn, the radio said, they demonstrated their thanks by filling in craters in the road ahead.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the current crisis in Somalia, Mozambique has headed all recent misery indexes. During five centuries of Portuguese colonialism and the nearly two decades of war that followed, Mozambicans have been among the world's poorest people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visitors to the fertile tropical nation on the Indian Ocean are struck by the contrast between the country's potential and its grim reality. Through the years, the country has attracted hundreds of young volunteer workers from Western countries who were drawn by the idealistic rhetoric of its Marxist government and the apparently unquenchable spirit of its people. But recent visitors comment on the air of desperation and discouragement that permeates everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989, the ruling party abandoned its Marxist label and proposed constitutional reforms in advance of multiparty elections. The government appealed to the Renamo rebel movement, whose attacks had destroyed most of the country's few hospitals, roads, schools and churches, to give up its arms and join the democratic process. On October 4, after more than two years of peace talks in Rome, Italy, the two sides signed a peace accord.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arthur Goldstuck * Weekly Mail Johannesburg, South Africa &quot;Glass palace&quot; was John Vorster's scathing term for it. And as little as a year ago, the idea of involving the United Nations in solving South Africa's problems was unthinkable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet by the time the UN Observer Mission in South Africa (Unomsa) set up office in Johannesburg last month, it blended almost immediately into the South African political scenery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think South Africans have adjusted exceptionally fast to the idea of transition toward a democratic society,' says Angela King, chief of the mission, in an interview at her office in Johannesburg's Carton Hotel. &quot;The reaction to our arrival has been warm and welcoming.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamaican-born King, who is 54, moved into the Unomsa hot seat -- her first UN post as a &quot;field worker&quot; -- from a position as director of staff administration and training in the UN office for human resources management.  Before that, she was director of recruitment and placement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why was a personnel manager chosen for a peacemaking job? &quot;You'll have to ask (UN secretary-general) Boutros Boutros-Ghali,&quot; she says, but adds that effective use of people's skills is as crucial in human resources management as it is in a UN mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She bristles at the suggestion that the mission is a &quot;second division team,&quot; foisted upon South Africa because more seasoned observers were busy in other trouble spots. In part the perception arose because of the mission's small size -- 50 people compared with 800 in Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a clear mandate from the Security Council, she says. &quot;The numbers of the forces and the nature of their deployment were left very much to the discretion of the secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The original team in Yugoslavia was (only) 30 strong. UN people also went to Namibia in phases. They started with probably 150 and then, as they established themselves on the ground, it went wider. By the time of the election it was 800.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King stresses that the size of United Nations missions are linked to requirements on the ground. In Namibia for instance, the UN was involved in everything from setting up electoral districts to training workshops on how to run an election. In Cambodia, by contrast, the UN was asked to move into virtually every government department and get the country running again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN and the Security Council looked very carefully at the African National Congress' demand for 400 monitors, King said. The world body decided that because of the sophistication of the peace infrastructure in South Africa, observers, not monitors, were appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In South Africa you have well developed structures. We will liaise with these structures and report back to the secretary-general on whether the UN mandate needs to be broadened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The decision was that the mission should be enlarged in a phased way.  The Security Council did give the secretary-general the authority to deploy any amount of people, and a total of 400 has not been ruled out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delay in the arrival of the full UN team has fueled criticism that the demand for a UN presence in regional disputes around the world means it cannot give South Africa the attention it needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King heads a group that initially numbered 28 and was expected to reach 50 by the end of October. A third of the Unomsa team was to arrive from Angola at the conclusion of that country's first democratic elections. However, the dispute over the Angolan election results delayed their arrival here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King is aware of suspicion of Unomsa in some anti-government circles, based on a perception that it works hand-in-glove with the authorities. There also has been criticism of the UN for allowing government security forces to provide mission members with transportation in certain cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been at pains to be in touch with all parties involved in the National Peace Accord,&quot; she explains. &quot;We have had offers of assistance not only from the government but from the major parties concerned -- for transportation, arranging meetings, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unomsa's public assertion of its neutrality ranges from a liberal use of UN flags and stickers on its cars to a refusal to appear on platforms that are not part of the peace accord structures. The Security Council resolution that created Unomsa specifically requires the mission to &quot;strengthen and reinforce the indigenous mechanisms set up under the National Peace Accord, so as to enhance their capacity in the building of peace,&quot; says King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's network of peace structures, she says, offers tremendous hope for the future, because &quot;so much work went into thinking out the structures,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're here to try and help, by our presence, to defuse tensions which may prevent the transition to democracy. The structures are there and the means are there for it to happen.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Karen Gellen * Africa News Service United Nations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War and famine in Sudan will turn Africa's largest country into &quot;another Somalia&quot; unless the international community intervenes. That warning was brought to the United Nations by two prominent Sudanese bishops who say they are seeking to pierce a wall of silence surrounding a widening disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paride Taban and Macram Max, representing the Sudanese Roman Catholic Bishops Conference, are calling for strong international pressure to end their country's bloody civil war. In a meeting with UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the clerics stressed the urgent need for a full-scale relief effort to avert widespread starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their alarm is being echoed by relief workers in Sudan. Jean-Luc Siblot, an official of the UN World Food Program, says the situation for the 5 million people in the south of the country, where the latest round of fighting has persisted for the past nine years, has &quot;never been worse.&quot; Up to a million people now face death from hunger, he told Cable News Network late last month.  Amid the mounting death toll, Siblot says, there is &quot;chaos everywhere.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food has become a key weapon in the war between the government in Khartoum, the capital, and the rebel Sudanese Peoples' Liberation Army (SPLA), which controls large stretches of territory in the South. Relief flights to those in desperate need can only take place when clearance is obtained from both warring sides -- and each frequently has balked. Because of the war, private aid agencies are unable to maintain personnel in the embattled region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, three UN workers and a journalist died under still unexplained circumstances in rebel-held territory in the South. And the government is believed to have executed two Sudanese employees of the U.S.  government and another employee of the European Community in Juba, the largest southern town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops charge that the Sudanese government's effort to impose Islamic fundamentalism on the country by force is leading to a form of &quot;genocide.&quot; Max calls the government's practices a &quot;shameful and degrading example of apartheid.&quot; Although the clerics charge the government's principal target is the mainly black population of the South, which largely practices Christianity or traditional African religions, the bishops stress that moderate Arab Muslims in the North &quot;are also being persecuted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Bishop Taban, who is president of the Sudan Council of Churches, the world is largely unaware of the disaster in his country. Much of the population in the South is &quot;locked up as if in a zoo,&quot; he says. &quot;But it's worse -- at least in game parks in places like Kenya, people drive by the animals in cars -- our people are never seen by any other human beings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most severely affected people, Taban says, are those trapped in areas under neither government nor rebel control. Their condition is appalling, he says. &quot;Millions are isolated, reduced to wearing leaves from the trees. Many haven't tasted salt in 10 years -- they have been returned to the Stone Age.  Thousands are dying of disease and hunger, and no help is allowed to reach them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vast numbers are homeless, living in camps as internal refugees, Taban says. In one small area just over the Kenyan border, the Sudan Council of Churches is caring for l6,000 Sudanese orphans between the ages of six and l5.  And near the town of Torit, the bishops' parish, there is a camp housing 250,000 uprooted people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops say the government has systematically expelled foreign church workers who were aiding the population and is closing local Sudanese church parishes. &quot;They are tightening the noose every day,&quot; says Bishop Max.  &quot;They have even expelled the sisters of Mother Theresa of Calcutta. In one case they ran a bulldozer right through a church.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expulsions not only have thwarted relief efforts, but they also have removed foreign witnesses to the suffering and repression, the clerics say. At the same time, the government is recruiting other foreigners to fight in the South. Fundamentalist university students from Pakistan and Iran, says Taban, have joined what the Sudanese government terms a jihad, or holy war, in southern Sudan. He says: &quot;There are Muslims in Juba now who have long beards and are ethnically unlike any Moslems we've ever seen in Sudan. They are fighting and playing a security role in special areas such as the university in Juba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Sudan Council of Churches lodged a protest with the Pakistani government about the role of its citizens, Taban says, Karachi denied giving aid or official sanction to the fighters, whom it terms &quot;volunteers&quot; or &quot;mercenaries.&quot; Taban says Khartoum is also receiving financial aid from the Iranian government and is using the money to buy weapons from China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops hope their visit to the United States will help build pressure on Khartoum to cooperate in helping stem the immediate suffering and, ultimately, to negotiate with the SPLA for an end to the war. They point with satisfaction to the resolution adopted a few weeks ago by the U.S. Senate that condemns the Sudanese government's &quot;consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution demands that Sudan allow &quot;unrestricted&quot; and &quot;unconditional access&quot; to international relief organizations and guarantee the safety of aid workers. The statement condemns what it terms a &quot;cruel campaign&quot; to relocate some 750,000 internally displaced southerners and westerners from the outskirts of Khartoum to &quot;inhospitable camps far from the city&quot; and criticizes the government for forcibly displacing tens of thousands of Nuba-speaking people from their ancestral homes, destroying villages, and &quot;killing hundreds of civilians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we finally have something in our hands,&quot; Taban says. &quot;We're carrying that statement around like a newborn baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishop also welcomed last month's official pronouncement by the Vatican on human rights in Sudan. Pope John Paul II spoke publicly on the issue for the first time during a meeting with a delegation of Sudanese bishops. But the bishops want the church to take the further step of breaking off relations with Khartoum. While in Rome, Taban says, the bishops questioned continued Vatican contacts with a government &quot;that is slaughtering its own people, because that kind of diplomacy means fearing a government more than fearing God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops say they hope their session with the UN secretary-general may boost their efforts to get a hearing in Khartoum. &quot;We're very grateful to have had our photo taken with Boutros-Ghali,&quot; Taban says. &quot;Now someone in the Sudanese government may give us an answer instead of simply throwing our letters in the trash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the United Nations, the bishops discussed efforts to open relief routes in the South with Jan Eliasson, the undersecretary- general for humanitarian affairs, who recently visited Sudan. Eliasson won the agreement of both the government and the SPLA for flights to 21 new areas, but large stretches of the region are still out of reach of aid deliveries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Bishop Taban warns, a further destabilizing factor now pushing Sudan toward a tragedy of the dimensions of Somalia is the splintering taking place within the SPLA. In rebel-held areas, he says, the SPLA historically has provided a modicum of order. But the movement now is split into three contending factions, and this could be a prelude to the kind of deadly &quot;warlord-ism&quot; seen in Somalia, the bishop fears.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peacekeeping is not a new function for the 179-member United Nations.  It was a central purpose when the organization was founded after World War II.  But the demand for UN mediation of conflicts in Africa and elsewhere has reached an unprecedented level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resignation late last month of the UN's chief official in Somalia, Mohammed Sahnoun, is an indicator of the strains on the peacekeeping process.  Currently, the organization has a direct involvement in five problem areas on the African continent and is likely to take a role in at least two others (see map on page 7). &quot;We are stretching to get the troops and logistical support and to find the financial resources to insure that we carry out these operations effectively,&quot; says Kofi Annan, UN assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve peacekeeping efforts have been undertaken by the United Nations in the past three years, as many as in the three preceding decades of the organization's existence. The easing of East/West tensions and the end of the Cold War has opened doors for UN peacekeepers that had been closed by big power rivalries. In Africa, where many of the Cold War's battles were fought, the cries for outside mediation are particularly loud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a &quot;propitious moment,&quot; a time when &quot;carefully concerted intervention and carefully concerted assistance can produce results, says Olara Otunnu, president of the New York-based International Peace Academy. The &quot;Cold War scaffolding&quot; that kept unpopular regimes in place and fueled destructive wars has disappeared, Otunnu says, replaced by &quot;conflict fatigue&quot; throughout Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otunnu argues that the United Nations must be bold enough to seize the opportunity to promote lasting peace. &quot;It has a Secretariat which has been honed to play this role,&quot; he says. &quot;It has a Security Council that includes the major powers and provides the political back-up for the secretary-general. The United Nations is the only organization that can do this job adequately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis in Somalia has created special difficulties for the UN system. After a slow start, a relief effort has been gaining support and momentum and a new 100-day emergency plan has just been adopted. But many UN officials and ambassadors fear that Sahnoun's departure will set back the process at a crucial juncture. Interviewed in New York just prior to his resignation, Sahnoun emphasized the importance of &quot;increased international pressure&quot; on the warring factions and of a &quot;fully coordinated approach&quot; to ensure that all UN and private relief agencies &quot;present a common front.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a number of occasions, Sahnoun's outspokenness about the United Nations' failure to move decisively created tension within the organization. In an interview with the Washington Post's Africa correspondent, Keith Richburg, Sahnoun specifically criticized UN Undersecretary James Jonah, saying: &quot;Jonah was the African in charge. He should have drawn the world's attention to Somalia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonah has other critics within the UN system, and there are reports that he will lose his job in a budget-cutting restructuring that Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is expected to announce soon. But the public criticism provoked a reprimand from Boutros-Ghali to Sahnoun, who resigned and was immediately replaced by Iraqi diplomat Ismat Kittani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the difficulties, Annan believes the United Nations is making progress in Somalia. &quot;By the beginning of December, we hope to have 750 Canadian troops, 550 Belgian troops, 750 Egyptians and, eventually, 750 Nigerian troops, plus logistical units from as far away as Australia, New Zealand and India,&quot; he says. Including the 500 Pakistani soldiers already on the ground in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, the combined forces of about 4,200 should be able to secure the ports and airports and protect the deliveries of relief supplies to all parts of the country, he says. At the same time, the United Nations is seeking to promote a political settlement among all the Somali parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Somali crisis has stimulated a reassessment of conflict resolution generally, says the Peace Academy's Otunnu. &quot;For the first time, the issue is being looked at through a humanitarian prism and the issue of national sovereignty is no longer seen as automatically overriding,&quot; he says. In situations of &quot;extreme suffering,&quot; the world community now seems more willing to intervene to help those in need.  *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c8">VIEWPOINT--by Margaret Calhoun</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">867 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola's first election, which pitted areformist Soviet satellite regime, the MPLA, against Unita, a formerly U.S.-backed rebel insurgency, has been praised as free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strong voter turnout proved the Angolan people's desire for peace and democracy. While it is accurate that the casting of ballots -- a process witnessed on a limited basis by international observers -- was relatively free and fair, it must also be said that the largely unobserved tabulation of these ballots may have been fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 2, ten of 13 political parties fielding presidential candidates, including Unita, issued a joint declaration alleging fraud, which they warned could be a &quot;catalyst for destabilization of the whole democratic process.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaints stem from a fundamental problem in Angola's electoral structure. The MPLA-staffed National Electoral Commission (NEC) is in charge of processing and disseminating all electoral data and, in an evident conflict of interest, handling fraud complaints. The NEC was to have been supervised by the United Nations, but the UN admitted it had a severe shortage of resources to manage the election observation properly, including a lack of helicopters, aircraft and ground personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system had, nevertheless, a built-in verification mechanism: party poll watchers were permitted to verify the results, which were compiled and transmitted from polling stations to the 18 provincial capitals and then to the national capital, Luanda. Unfortunately, both the UN fraud investigators and opposition political parties have had difficulty accessing NEC computers.  Further, NEC results reportedly were determined in some instances by tallies signed by poll workers and party monitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other disturbing elements of the election include reports of stolen ballots, faceless voter registration cards, the sudden creation of some 100 &quot;mobile&quot; polling stations without the knowledge of party delegates, the circulation of surplus ballots, reports of Namibians crossing the border to vote, and a curiously large percentage of nulos, or nullified ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These irregularities can and should be reconciled and resolved, but it is impossible to quantify the impact on voters of the MPLA's feared &quot;anti-riot&quot; police -- armed with Soviet AK-47 assault rifles and highly visible in Huila Province, where I was a monitor, and frequently near polling stations within the restricted boundary. We saw several examples of riot police engaged in both subtle and overt intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one remote polling station outside of Lubango, which we reached after passing through a police roadblock, two armed policemen stood on the open road only 50 yards from the voting booth. At another site in Chibia, two polling stations were positioned one block from the local police station. In Luanda, the standard anti-riot police posture is a vertically held AK-47, forefinger on the trigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now clear that the MPLA does not want adequate international monitoring of a second round of voting. Instead, with the killing of top Unita leaders, the MPLA has reverted to its well-known Stalinist tacticts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A summit between dos Santos and Savimbi has been delayed repeatedly, primarily because Savimbi's security could not be safegauarded in the capital.  The murders of Unita officials proves that those concerns were justified. The United States must hold the MPLA responsible for the safety of Savimbi and the remaining Unita leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is Angola's largest trading partner, and the U.S.  government spent approximately $ 250 million backing Unita with the purpose of forcing the MPLA Marxists to hold free elections. If a broad range of the Angolan political spectrum believes fraud was rife in the system, it is unlikely there will be the necessary political consensus to bring about the objective of U.S. policy toward Angola -- a peaceful democratic state. The only choice for the Angolans -- if the fraud investigation is a whitewash and no structural improvements are made prior to the second round of voting -- could well be a return to lengthy armed conflict.  *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c8">VIEWPOINT--by William Minter</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1320 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just one month after enthusiastic Angolans voted peacefully in their first multiparty election ever, the war-battered country is again on the brink of all-out war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the rebel group Unita is persuaded to halt its current offensive, there may be months of uncertainty before a runoff takes place between President Eduardo dos Santos, who won 49.57% of the September 29 vote, and Unita leader Jonas Savimbi, who came in second with 40.07%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Savimbi was persuaded temporarily to accept the official election results, which also gave the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) a 129 to 70 margin over Unita in the legislature, he continued to claim the election was marked by massive fraud. He has signaled his willingness to use violence to ensure his preeminence, despite a lack of support from his former patrons in the United States and South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five days after the Angolan election, a peace agreement in Mozambique formally ended over 12 years of insurgency by the externally supported rebel group known as Renamo. But there, too, fighting resumed when Renamo launched attacks on government-held towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions of people have died in these two wars that were fueled from outside by South Africa's defense of apartheid and by the Cold War campaign against Maputo and Luanda. For the peace agreements to hold, the international community must take an active role in supporting the processes of peace and elections, as well as economic reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States, which provided direct military support to Unita and tolerated South African backing of Renamo's terror campaign, bears special responsibility. It must support adequate levels of international involvement and help to restrain combatants who received outside backing from taking up arms again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolan and Mozambican situations are not identical. The threat in Angola comes from a megalomaniacal political leader with real political support among a minority of Angolans, who has demonstrated unwillingness to share power with his opponents or even with his colleagues. In Mozambique, the danger comes from a movement with an unparalleled history of brutality and from the coincidence of the worst drought in the 20th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But beyond the differences there is a striking similarity. In both cases, violent forces have been fostered from the outside. The United States must support effective sanctions barring any outside material support to parties violating the peace accords and should offer adequate military resources to those defending the integrity of the democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renewed war in Angola would be a tragic sequel to what was, against great odds, an exemplary election process. Coming just 16 months after the May 1991 cease-fire, the Angolan voting faced enormous practical difficulties. Many roads are still mined; the country's population is almost 60% illiterate; and there has been large-scale movement of rural people since the last census in 1970. The country still has two separate armies, despite the peace accord proviso that the troops would be demobilized and a new national army created before the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International support for the polling was minimal. An estimated 800 international observers were present, compared with 6,000 for the 1989 elections in Namibia, a country with less than one-fifth Angola's population.  International ob-servers nonetheless were highly impressed with the orderly, cooperative and transparent organization of the election process. The National Electoral Council, which includes representatives of all parties, made an extraordinary effort to demonstrate openness and impartiality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After careful study of all the specific complaints received, United Nations observers concluded that the elections were &quot;generally free and fair.&quot; The U.S. State Department concurred. Nongovernmental observers also agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Unita supporters among U.S. officials stationed in Luanda seem to feel that Savimbi has only himself to blame for the loss. His belligerent campaign, in which he often appeared in uniform armed with a pistol, was at odds with Angolan war-weariness, while dos Santos effectively projected a peacemaker image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angolan voters had many conflicting pressures: disillusionment with government economic failures, fear of war, traditional ethnic loyalties and fear in many rural areas of possible reprisals by one side or the other. But the balance tilted against Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there were unfair aspects of the election, they were structural and not readily apparent to short-term visitors. Minor parties correctly complained that they did not have a fair chance, despite equal television time allocated to all parties regardless of size. But in comparative terms they undoubtedly had a fairer chance than non-billionaire minor condidates in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Luanda government did use the advantages of incumbency. But the most serious breach in fairness -- possible intimidation of rural voters -- probably aided Unita. Areas under Unita control were the most restricted and least open to campaigning by rival parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community, including the United States, has unanimously urged Savimbi to accept the election results. Angolans, including Unita supporters, are almost universally war-weary. But Savimbi and his closely knit group of top officers remain both unpredictable and militarily potent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolan government and most outside observers agree that there must be some form of participation in government, beyond its share of legislative representation, for Unita's constituency. But no compromise proposal can inspire confidence that it will be adhered to by both sides, as long as Unita is controlled by a leader hostile to democratic values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mozambique, the history of Renamo's failure to adhere to agreements suggests that future violations are highly likely. Over the years of negotiations, the international community, including the United States, provided support for the Mozambican government and refused overt assistance to Renamo. At the same time, however, outsiders failed to bring significant pressure to bear on Renamo and its backers. There is legitimate concern in Mozambique that fighting will continue unless there is a major international effort to oversee compliance with the peace accord.  *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace accords ending two of Africa's longest-lasting wars are being put to the test in the former Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An agreement signed last month in Rome by the government of Mozambique and the Mozambique Resistance Movement, known as Renamo, was breeched almost immediately by Renamo attacks on four district capitals in the north.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continuing fighting increases the threat of starvation for more than three million Mozambicans already experiencing famine from severe drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Angola, disagreement over the results of late-September elections erupted in violence at the end of October, raising further fears that the country could be plunged back into civil war. A cease-fire was signed last year by the U.S.- and South African-backed National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita) and the Soviet-backed ruling party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPLA led the September balloting, but Unita and other opposition groups have charged that the process was unfair. The clashes came amid reports that Unita had launched military offensives in several parts of the country. In Luanda, the capital, top civilian and military leaders of Unita, including Vice President Jeremias Chitunda, were killed in the fighting, with Unita accusing the MPLA of execution-style murders of its followers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomats from several nations have been working to bring the warring parties back to the negotiating table. On this page, two Americans who observed Angola's election present differing views about the causes of the conflict.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month's election in the West African nation of Cameroon was a breakthrough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time since independence in 1960, Cameroonians were offered a choice of candidates on their presidential ballots. But when the official results showed President Paul Biya as the winner, with 39.9% of the votes, the opposition cried foul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the country is locked in a stand-off. On November 3, Biya was sworn in for a third term. However, opposition leader John Fru Ndi is claiming to be the victor and his supporters have been protesting the government's actions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to agreeing to hold the elections, Biya resisted calls for political reform, insisting until recently on the maintenance of the one-party system. However, continued domestic demands and pressure from international aid donors forced change, and the October 11 contest pitted Biya against eight opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large-scale demonstrations, like those that forced Biya's hand last year, have again become commonplace in the northwestern region, where Fru Ndi's backing is the strongest. The government has reacted by sending police to break up marches and by placing Fru Ndi and other opposition leaders under house arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign observers have concluded that the election failed to meet international standards of fairness. A multinational observer mission organized by the National Democratic Institute (NDI) in Washington, DC, has issued a preliminary report outlining the reasons for the negative assessment. The report follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On election day, the NDI observer delegation visited polling sites in nine of Cameroon's ten provinces. On October 15, four days after the election, the delegation issued a preliminary statement, which highlighted problems in the electoral process. However, the delegation withheld a final assessment of the process, pending release of the final results and an evaluation of the election-related complaints filed by various political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the close nature of the contest, the slow counting of the ballots, and the serious allegations of fraud and manipulation presented by opposition parties, delegation co-leader and former Maine Attorney General Jim Tierney remained in Cameroon for 11 days after the election.  Mr. Tierney met with representatives of the political parties and the election commission and other knowledgeable Cameroonians. Mr. Tierney also sought to investigate specific complaints presented by representatives of several political parties.  On October 23, the Supreme Court announced the official results, in which incumbent President Paul Biya was declared the winner of the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NDI notes several positive features of the election. In particular, these include a strong sense of civic duty on the part of the Cameroonian people on election day and the dedication of the many election officials and political party representatives who, under difficult circumstances, sought to conduct an open and fair election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, NDI concludes that widespread irregularities during the pre-election period, on election day and in the tabulation of results seriously call into question, for any fair observer, the validity of the outcome. It would not be an exaggeration to suggest that this election system was designed to fail. While several parties were responsible for election irregularities, the overwhelming weight of responsibility for this failed process lies with the government and President Biya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence supporting this conclusion includes, but is not limited to, the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The election was scheduled hastily by President Biya before the adoption of an election law. Once enacted, the law provided for a 30-day period prior to the polling, which was impossible given the date already set for the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The election system provided civil administration officials responsible to President Biya ... with excessive discretion in matters of voter registration and ballot tabulation, which many officials abused to further the political interests of the incumbent president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tabulation of votes was conducted under the authority of the minister of Territorial Administration, whose partisan support for President Biya was unmistakable. In violation of the electoral law, the Ministry of Territorial Administration had originally decided to prohibit political party representatives from obtaining tally sheets of election results at the polling sites. While this decision was ultimately reversed, the electoral law did not provide an opportunity for party representatives to monitor the transfer of tally sheets to the departmental election commissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NDI has received direct testimony to the effect that prior to the elections, high-level government officials were told that their performance would be rated on the number of votes President Biya garnered in their respective areas. They were reportedly given a goal of 60% and told that this figure should be achieved by whatever means was necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The National Vote Counting Commission, which was appointed only days before the election, failed to inspire public confidence in the integrity of the tabulation process. The commission did not represent a geographic, ethnic, regional or political balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Voter registration was needlessly restricted, as the registration process was not reopened following the announcement of the election date. This decision, in effect, disenfranchised the many Cameroonians who had boycotted the March 11 legislative elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Little control was exercised over the distribution of voter registration cards, thus creating an opportunity for multiple voting and underage voting. Handfuls of cards were repeatedly offered to the observers as proof of a lively market in voter card trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Maroua, a recently arrived subdistrict officer signed what were, by some accounts, 6,000 voter registration cards which were back-dated to appear to have been issued during the legally permitted registration period earlier in the year. Observers witnessed the distribution of these cards by opposition parties as well as supporters of President Biya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, voter registries were generally not published before election day, precluding the possibility that parties or voters could review the lists to ensure their accuracy. The NDI delegation observed or received complaints regarding numerous examples of voters whose names had been on the electoral list but who were not allowed to vote. In a number of provinces, would-be voters who had not been allowed to cast ballots showed observers voter cards that had been stamped at the time of the March legislative elections to demonstrate that they had been permitted to vote at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The election campaign was marred by the extremely partisan use of the government-controlled television and radio in favor of the incumbent president. The observer delegation's preliminary statement makes reference to this biased news coverage. The statement cited the television news broadcast on October 7, in which the government received 142 minutes of coverage, while only 12 minutes were allotted to the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* On election day, rules regarding voter eligibility were not uniformly applied. Through-out the country, the names of eligible voters were improperly crossed off the register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Polling sites were arbitrarily moved in some areas prior to election day in an apparent effort to sow confusion and reduce voter turnout in specific regions. Observers documented this problem in Yaounde, Maroua, Douala, Garoua, and Ebolowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Political party poll watchers were prevented from entering polling sites and, in one case, were barred from entering the entire territory of Rey-Bouba in the district of Mayo Rey, which was controlled by a traditional leader who supported President Biya. The observer delegation noted other highly partisan acts by polling site officials in Yaounde and Maroua.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;Ghost&quot; precincts, i.e., precincts that did not exist on the official list distributed by the election commission prior to the election, reported overwhelming vote totals in favor of President Biya, contrasting dramatically with the results from other polling sites in the area. In Foumbat in the Noun Division in the West province, for example, ten polling places which did not exist on the official list of polling places were cited in a compilation of results forwarded by the subdistrict officer to the departmental commission. The results from these polling places provided overwhelming, and similar, vote totals in favor of President Biya, while the remainder of the area voted largely in favor of another candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Statistically anomalous results were reported from several polling sites. One example involved a polling site from the Mvila Division in the Ebolowa area, which reported a 100% turnout of 5,856 eligible voters, all of whom cast their ballots for President Biya. Similar, although slightly less extreme, examples were recorded in neighboring polling places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Undue delays in the release of the official results provided the opportunity for wholesale manipulation, while the failure to publish site-by-site results precludes the possibility of a credible, independent review of the overall election results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NDI has an obligation to evaluate the election process in Cameroon using the same objective standards that it has employed in observing more than 40 elections throughout the world. In the case of Cameroon, the seriousness of the irregularities has been underscored by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, when he announced the official results, and by the minister of Justice in an interview with a Cameroonian newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conclusion, NDI urges all Cameroonian political parties to pursue a peaceful resolution to the problems confronting the country. The divisions that have emerged as a result of the presidential election should not be allowed to reverse the progress that has occurred in Cameroon during the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NDI recognizes that the people of Cameroon are the ultimate judges of their electoral process. This interim report is a reflection of a growing consensus in Cameroon. NDI hopes that the views expressed herein will contribute to a better understanding, both inside Cameroon and around the world, of what occurred during this electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NDI urges all sides to come together in peaceful dialogue and to reach agreement on a course of action that will resolve the current impasse. A violent reaction by any of the parties or the government will tend to influence negatively the views of the international community toward the perpetrators. It is time for reflection, dialogue and negotiation among all Cameroonians.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King Goodwill Zwelithini, leader of the traditional royal family of the Zulu nation, appears headed for a confrontation with the ethnic Zulu administration established by the South African government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mangosuthu Buthelezi, chief minister of kwaZulu, has monopolized the headlines in recent years as a rival to African National Congress (ANC) leader Nelson Mandela. But King Zwelithini, whose role is largely ceremonial, commands strong loyalty in rural Natal province, which is also Buthelezi's power base.  Although Zwelithini has appeared in the role of &quot;head of state&quot; at functions where Buthelezi presides, he has avoided political attachments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the king is backing traditional chiefs who are resisting Buthelezi's attempts to install his own handpicked leaders in northern Natal.  The area, known as Babanango, is historically under the direct rule of the crown and in recent years has been administered by the king's cousin. When the cousin died in September, Buthelezi stepped up a four-year effort to appoint his own chiefs to administer Babanango.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen local leaders have filed suit against Buthelezi in the Durban Supreme Court, asking that the chief minister be stopped from imposing administrators without popular consent. Although King Zwelithini is not a formal party to the court case, he has let it be known that he favors the Babanango petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent months, as the conflict between supporters of the ANC and loyalists of Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party has grown more violent, the king has been under increasing pressure to take a public stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month the president of Contralesa -- the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa -- told students in Natal that Zwelithini should start attending ANC rallies, as well as those of Inkatha. Zwelithini is king &quot;of all the Zulus, including those who are members of the ANC,&quot; Patekile Holomisa said in a speech at the University of Zululand. Holomisa said the king could use the respect he enjoys to encourage a climate of political tolerance among Natal's warring parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buthelezi has been dubbed the &quot;leader of the Zulus&quot; in news accounts and the ANC/Inkatha rivalry has been reported as an ethnic conflict. But a number of South Africans, including journalists, are challenging those labels.  Writing in Britain's Observer newspaper, Allister Sparks says Buthelezi's claims to represent public opinion in Natal have never been proven. &quot;Opinion polls are frustratingly inadequate,&quot; Sparks says, &quot;and pollsters do not venture into strife-torn parts of Natal and kwaZulu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC activists say that the 90% support in Natal cities for the group's strikes and &quot;mass actions&quot; suggests that Buthelezi's mantle of leadership was conferred more by the press than by the people. And they argue that the ferocity of the fighting in Natal, where almost all the victims are Zulu, is irrefutable evidence that the rivalry is political rather than ethnic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buthelezi, who has a reputation for supreme self confidence, recently implied that his own influence in Natal may be more limited than he has sometimes indicated. He told a reporter last month that the conflict is too bitter for anyone to curb, including himself or Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ghanaians went to the polls on November 3 -- the same day as the presidential election in the United States -- they chose continuity over change. Flt. Lt. Jerry Rawlings, who took power in a military coup on December 31, 1981, had a margin of victory that was much wider than his opponents had expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teams of international observers from the Carter Center in Atlanta, the Organization of African Unity and from Commonwealth countries, who monitored the process, rated it largely free and fair, although widespread irregularities were noted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition parties are protesting the outcome and threatening to boycott the parliamentary elections scheduled for December 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary totals show that just under half of the country's 8.4 million registered voters took part in the nation's first election in 13 years. Rawlings received over 2.3 million votes (58.6% of the total) compared to nearly 1.2 million (30%) for his closest rival, Albert Abu Boahen of the New Patriotic Party. The former air force flight lieutenant ran well in several areas thought to be opposition terrain. While the Volta region, Rawlings' ethnic base, voted overwhelmingly for him, some of his rivals lost in their home areas. However, Rawlings is reported to have lost to Boahen in several military barracks. Rawlings resigned his military commission to participate in the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings' popularity stems both from his charismatic personality and from his government's success at achieving six straight years of robust economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for a few short-lived marches of jubilation by Rawlings' supporters on election night, Accra remained curiously quiet after the voting.  A curfew was imposed in the northern city of Kumasi following post-election rioting, but party leader there called for calm pending the release of the final election report from the National Electoral Commission.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York Tami Hultman &amp; Reed Kramer * Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years ago, five production teams from NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show were about to fan out across Africa as the advance troops for an ambitious campaign to cover the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bold plan to originate live from a different region every day called for a chartered Swissair jet to whisk host Bryant Gumbel across thousands of miles between each show. It was a grueling schedule -- and a costly one. And that was its undoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extensive coverage of Chinese student protests in Tienanmen Square had sapped the show's news budget, and the executives of General Electric, which had recently bought NBC, were reluctant for the network to commit itself to a sizable expenditure for Africa coverage. &quot;Their attitude,&quot; said a person who worked for &quot;Today&quot; at the time, &quot;was: 'Who cares about Africa anyhow?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it turned out, Bryant Gumbel did. Although the idea was shelved, he kept it alive, going back to executives again and again. On Friday, November 13, viewers can see the result when the show goes on the air from Harare, Zimbabwe. During the week of November 16, the program's backdrops, in addition to Harare, will be the Hwange National Park and Victoria Falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his New York office, nursing sharp back pains that he hopes will ease before the long flight to Africa, Gumbel is reluctant to expand on the problems of getting the project approved by NBC executives. &quot;I'll allow this,&quot; he says. &quot;They could always find a number of reasons why they should not take the risk, and on our part we kept coming to them with a budget that was difficult for them to swallow, because the cost of doing business in Africa is considerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would prefer to focus on the fact that we kept going back and redoing the budget and rethinking our game plan in order to find some way of representing the continent fairly and economically,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosting the shows from one country rather than five was one of the economies. But half a dozen segment producers with camera crews have traveled widely in recent months, taping reports that will be used in the programs.  Gumbel is pleased with the breadth and diversity of the pieces that will air.  He says there were many stories he wanted to do and couldn't because of cost or logistical problems or safety factors. &quot;But I don't want to belabor them,&quot; he says, &quot;because the fact is the continent offered us so many possibilities that, while I may lose three dozen, five dozen stories, there are a hundred dozen that are still valid and do-able, so I don't feel terrible about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There turned out to be so many stories that the production team couldn't bear to exclude that the original five-day schedule was expanded to six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynne Edwards, who works from NBC's London bureau, says the shows have been a welcome opportunity to do substantive journalism on Africa for a major television audience. &quot;To be able to produce a report on women and desertification in West Africa for a program like 'Today' is fantastic,&quot; she says. But Edwards says that the serious reporting won't spell disappointment for viewers who are looking for exotic locations and fascinating topics. River journeys and a trip to the fabled Malian city of Timbuktu are among the show's destinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filming among the cliffside villages of Mali's ancient Dogon people, whose sophisticated cosmology still confounds astronomers, Edwards says she felt the thrill of being in a place that few Western camera crews have penetrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gumbel believes many viewers will be astonished as their images of Africa are eroded, and he sees that as one of the legacies of the series. It was Gumbel who argued, against some resistance, to use Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, as the setting for at least one of the shows. &quot;It doesn't necessitate somebody being so crude as to say, 'We're here in Africa and, yes, that's a city, and it's as modern as wherever...&quot; he says. &quot;I think it's enough to have that as a backdrop for two hours. That's going to shock some people. I'm not interested in beating them over the head with it, but I think it's worthwhile to surprise them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there was a reason why the Africa shows are being done now, beyond the interest of some of the show's producers and Gumbel's own persistence, it is an accident of timing. Last summer's Olympics, for which NBC had the broadcast contract, occupied the morning hours, preempting what Gumbel calls &quot;the assembly line of 'Today'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem with the 'Today' program,&quot; he says, &quot;is when I say goodbye on a Monday, I'm 22 hours removed from the next show. And the line keeps running. That doesn't afford us the opportunity to go over and shoot the footage we would need. Having the Olympics this year allowed us to shut the assembly line down for two and a half weeks and created a very rare window of opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gumbel acknowledges that the 12 hours of programming will not be all things to all people. &quot;People who are experts on Africa are going to be able to walk away and say, 'Well, that didn't do anything; that was superficial.' And they'll probably be right.&quot; But his pride in the project is obvious, and he argues that for most of those who watch, the shows will mean a major advancement in awareness. &quot;When you are working from ground zero,&quot; he says, &quot;even two seems like a large number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scope of the programs is so broad -- ranging from art to missionaries to safaris to antiquities to archeological treasures -- that there may, in the end, be something for everyone. And the show's staff has made a genuine effort to probe the complex issues that govern contemporary African reality, such as AIDS, debt, the democracy movement and the role of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what surprised him most when he finally got to Africa, Gumbel begs off answering. &quot;You've got to understand,&quot; he says, &quot;that I've been living with this project for years, and I have been trying to brief myself as much as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Gumbel, NBC's earlier decision not to go ahead with the project was a personal blow. But he didn't have long to think about it, because the &quot;Today&quot; show seemed to be falling apart around him. Reports of dissension among the staff and the departure of former co-host Jane Pauley sent ratings plummeting, and there was open talk in some quarters that Gumbel himself would be replaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, &quot;Today&quot; leads the morning ratings and the show's elated producers credit Gumbel with aiding the climb back to the top. Doing her share of the coverage, is current co-host Katie Couric, who will make her first trip to Africa to do this month's shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Gumbel, Couric cheerfully admits to being a total novice on African affairs; like most Americans, she still has a hard time sorting one African country from another. But the bubbling enthusiasm that helped attract viewers back to &quot;Today&quot; is near the surface when she talks about the Africa project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person who has worked on the series speculates that Couric's excitement when she gets to Africa may not do as much as the spectacular footage and dazzling graphics to infuse the audience with a sense of Africa's richness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gumbel says doing the shows has offered the perfect opportunity to inform while entertaining. &quot;The pictures are breathtakingly beautiful,&quot; he says, and audiences will find the shows fun to watch. That's important, he says, because ratings are important. &quot;Ultimately, it does not do us any good to do the most journalistically correct and worthwhile shows -- and have nobody watch them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says personal commitment to the project has been more complicated than his natural interest as an African American. &quot;It's a question of fairness,&quot; he says. &quot;I've originated programs from South America, from Europe, from Asia, from Australia, from New Zealand. The only one that hadn't been done is Africa. At some point you have to ask yourself, 'Why?'&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (Ecomog) -- A West African peacekeeping force sent to Monrovia in August 1990 by the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) to impose a cease-fire in the civil war. With soldiers from seven Ecowas member nations (Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ghana, Senegal, Mali and Gambia), the force has maintained order in the capital but has not been successful in plans to extend operations throughout the country, due to opposition from Charles Taylor. There were about 7,000 soldiers in Ecomog until recently when Nigerian reinforcements began arriving, pushing the total to an estimated 12,000 or more.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) -- The group that launched the civil war with a small-scale invasion from Cote d'Ivoire on Christmas Eve 1989, with the aim of ousting President Samuel K. Doe. Headed by Charles Taylor, the NPFL controls most of the Liberian countryside and has established a provisional government, headquartered in Gbarnga, 120 miles (194 kilometers) northeast of Monrovia. At the height of the war in 1990, NPFL was estimated to have about 10,000 people under arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL) -- A breakaway faction led by Prince Johnson, a former top Taylor lieutenant who took part in the original NPFL invasion. This group beat the NPFL to Monrovia in September 1990 and killed President Doe. Last month, after Taylor's forces overran Johnson's base at Caldwell, just outside the capital, Johnson surrendered to Ecomog in Monrovia. Many of his soldiers are believed to have rejoined the NPFL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) -- The country's national army, encamped and inactive since Ecomog's arrival and Doe's death in late 1990. AFL soldiers, who were Taylor's main opponents during the 1990 war, recently set up their own roadblocks and checkpoints in the capital. The AFL has also joined in some of the fighting on the front lines outside Monrovia, alongside Ecomog and a rebel group known as Ulimo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (Ulimo) -- A rebel group that emerged last year, made up of former members of Liberia's Armed Forces (AFL). Ulimo fighters launched an offensive against Taylor last August, saying force was the only way to make him disarm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Berets -- The newest addition to Liberia's armed factions. This group of about 400 armed men appeared in the capital in the past few months after undergoing training in Guinea. Their role is unclear. However, the interim government calls them an anti-terrorist force that assists with VIP protection in Monrovia. They are named for the caps they wear.  *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cindy Shiner * Africa News Service Monrovia, Liberia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A breeze carries the putrid smell of rotting flesh across the dirt road where the yellow carcass of a torched armored car lies idle. As gunfire breaks through the sound of buzzing flies and bird songs, the barefoot 72-year-old Rev. Samuel Jaia approaches with his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hello,&quot; he says cheerfully, putting down his little black briefcase and suitcase to speak with a reporter. He lets out a sigh, wipes the sweat from his forehead and smiles as if he is only having a hard day, instead of running for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is clear that he and his wife, daughter and grandson left their home in a hurry, just as more than 160,000 others around Monrovia have done since fighting broke out last month. Wearing only tattered white underwear and a T-shirt, five-year-old James tightly grips a little green lantern, flip flops and a yellow plastic water bottle, his eyes wide with fear.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of -- how do you call them? -- rockets fall around my place.  Too much,&quot; says the pastor. &quot;So, I say, well, let me try and go to my family to Logantown&quot; closer to the city. The firefights have knocked out telephone communications, and he hadn't heard that most of Logantown is deserted because of the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 3,000 people -- mainly civilians -- have been killed in the siege of Monrovia alone since Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front attacked the capital on October 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two years, a West African peacekeeping force has protected Monrovia and the surrounding area, and the city's pre-war population of 600,000 has more than doubled. The ferocity of the current fighting has terrified Liberians who thought the West African coalition would keep the city safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth Tshabalala, the World Health Organization's representative in Monrovia, says her team of 40 relief workers cannot even reach remote areas of the suburbs to pick up and bury the bodies because the task is too dangerous.  She fears the decomposing corpses will lead to outbreaks of cholera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospitals and relief centers in central Monrovia are jammed with families like the Jaia's. Some of the overcrowded facilities have problems with sanitation and are running short on medication and water. The United Nations has been distributing water by tank trucks, and a lingering rainy season has helped avert &quot;a disaster,&quot; says UN Children's Fund representative Carl Tinstman. Relief workers are urging residents to collect rainwater when they can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other refugees have been stranded in rural areas since fleeing their homes last August when the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (Ulimo) launched an offensive from neighboring Sierra Leone against Taylor's forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100,000 refugees, mainly from Sierra Leone, are in northwestern Liberia, cut off from assistance. Fighting and poor roads block relief workers from access to the area, and people are subsisting on the wild yams and fruit they can gather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johan Heffinck, of Medecins Sans Frontieres says there is a malnutrition rate of 43% among at least one group of 15,000 of the refugees -- a rate as bad as in Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in the capital, where West African patrols once inspired a sense of security, armed factions and thieves move freely. An interim government, sanctioned by the peacekeepers, appears powerless. At one shelter in the Monrovia suburb of Sinkor -- where shells launched by Taylor's forces and short-falling rockets from the West Africans land almost daily -- dozens of refugees swarm around a taxi carrying a foreigner, thinking money or food has arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the taxi pulls onto the street, three men follow the car and block its path. &quot;Why don't you get out of the car and take a walk with me down the street? I would like to discuss some things with you,&quot; says one, inspecting the inside of the car and staring at a purse on the floor. Such confrontations are a routine hazard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some refugees themselves have resorted to stealing, but it's a risky way to get by. Liberians deal with thieves harshly: crowds chase them down and beat them, sometimes until they die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most brutal thieves are the country's various rebels -- with noms de guerre such as Ulimo Ninja and Captain Blood -- who storm into homes and businesses, shooting anyone in their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ulimo fighters did this to me! They almost killed me!&quot; shouts Nazem Fawaz, a young Lebanese businessman, to relief workers and reporters on a crowded street. He pulled open his shirt, exposing a stitched, diagonal shoulder-to-belly gash. &quot;I was watching the news and I hear a knock at my door. I ask, 'Who is that?' They say, 'Officers.' I say, 'What officers?' and they say, 'Open the door or we'll spray the door.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says a rebel slashed him with a bayonet when he said he had no U.S.  dollars. The soldiers stole most of his belongings and destroyed his home and business, he says. As he recounts his tale, two Ulimo rebels stand a short distance away, watching and listening intently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most tragic victims in Liberia's war are its children, like five-year-old James, whose childhood memories will be of gunfire and terror. Late last month, the fighting trapped 300 orphans in Chocolate City, on the outskirts of the capital. Taylor's National Patriotic Front rebels stole their food and forced some of the children to fight alongside them, say orphans who managed to escape through the swamps to the Freeport area in Monrovia, where peacekeeping troops are based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are catching some of the boys to go with them, to (carry) arms, but still we escaped,&quot; says an emaciated 14-year-old named Junior Juluto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the boys who were kidnapped have gotten away, according to relief workers, but the girls and babies are still trapped and have been without food for over two weeks. Fighting has obstructed United Nations efforts to evacuate the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the orphans lost their parents in 1990, when civil war claimed an estimated 60,000 lives, including some 40,000 who starved. &quot;I don't have nobody here,&quot; says Junior, at the American Cooperative School in Monrovia where he is housed with 22 others who fled Chocolate City. &quot;I depend on the almighty God that I escape from there. I just pray to God to strengthen me. I just ask the Lord to bless me. That's all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the children who lost their parents and were separated from other family members are probably too young to identify themselves, says Myrtle Gibson, director of Liberian Children's Concern. &quot;I don't think most of those children will ever see their families again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although foreigners once felt relatively safe in Liberia, no one is spared the current conflict, as the deaths last month of five American nuns demonstrated. &quot;Missionaries have always, always been respected in Liberia,&quot; said Sister Barbara Brillant, an American nun from the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, in an interview just before the killings. &quot;Old people have been respected in Liberia. This is the first time there has been that loss of values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nuns were members of the Adorers of the Blood of Christ order, based in Ruma, Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sister Brillant, who has spent 15 years in Liberia, conducted missionary and relief work behind Taylor's lines in 1990. When American jets flew over Taylor's territory, to evacuate Americans that year, rebels held a gun to her head because she was an American, and they thought the United States was going to attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says she was able to talk her way out of being shot, using the street speech common among Liberians: &quot;I say, my man, you wanna shot me, you shoot me. But you see my face in the plane? I'm not in the plane,&quot; she told her captors. &quot;Today, it's a different situation,&quot; she says. It's harder to talk your way out of a mess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the fighting in 1990, soldiers from the national army of then-President Samuel K. Doe were believed responsible for the summary execution of hundreds of Liberians in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, for many Liberians, the nightmare of those days has returned. On a recent day along a back road near Monrovia's James Spriggs Payne Airport -- where many of the daily executions in 1990 took place -- one Liberian youth was seen trying his best to talk his way out of trouble with two soldiers. As one of the soldiers stopped a taxi carrying a foreign journalist and demanded to check the trunk for possible weapons, the other soldier kept his gun pointed at the youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed only in his trousers, the boy fell to his hands and knees, begging and crying for the soldier to have mercy on him. The taxi was allowed to drive away, but the teenager had nowhere to run.  *</SPAN></P>
