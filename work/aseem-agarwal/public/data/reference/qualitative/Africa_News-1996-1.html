<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - State House has thrown out an offer by the Foundation for<BR>Democratic Process (FODEP) to mediate in the on-going 'conflict' between<BR>President Chiluba and Post editor-in-chief Fred M'membe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a telephone interview yesterday, President Chiluba's public<BR>relations and press aide, Richard Sakala, said the issues raised by<BR>M'membe in his letter to Chiluba were criminal and only the courts can<BR>settle the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no question of reconciliation between President Chiluba and<BR>Fred M'membe,&quot; Sakala said.  &quot;What is there is for the two parties to<BR>meet in court.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Women for Change executive director, Emily Sikazwe, says that if<BR>what M'membe wrote in his letter was criminal then the President's<BR>attacks on him, to which he was responding, should also be criminalised.<BR>&quot;If what M'membe wrote to the President is criminal then the President's<BR>remarks on M'membe on the Night Line programme is also criminal,&quot;<BR>Sikazwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said it was unfortunate that President Chiluba would like to take<BR>M'membe to court without waiving his own immunity so that he too can be<BR>prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The President has immunity and it would be grossly unfair to take<BR>M'membe to court without waiving his immunity,&quot; Sikazwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But FODEP general secretary, Bishop John Mambo, has maintained that<BR>his organisation will still go ahead and mediate in the stand off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As FODEP we feel we should mediate in the conflict between<BR>President Chiluba and Mr M'membe,&quot; Mambo said in an interview yesterday,<BR>adding: &quot;This week we will be writing to President Chiluba so that we<BR>can arrange a meeting for these people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said going to court is not the best solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Court proceedings take between three to five years to conclude and<BR>that will not help anybody,&quot; Mambo said, adding: &quot;We don't have to wait<BR>until M'membe or Masautso Phiri (Post special projects editor) has an<BR>artificial accident for people to act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He dispelled claims by UNIP chairman, Malimba Masheke, that &quot;FODEP<BR>and MMD are one&quot;.<BR> &quot;I am above a person that can be used by anybody,&quot; Mambo seethed and<BR>noted that it was President Chiluba's special assistant for press,<BR>Richard Sakala who is &quot;not courageous enough to call M'membe to State<BR>House to discuss the issue. That is why we have decided to put a brake<BR>on this issue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ZIMT president, Alfred Zulu, said no Non Governmental<BR>Organisation has the right to mediate in the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the President feels offended its up to the judiciary to take<BR>effect and not an NGO,&quot; Zulu said in an interview on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 'conflict' between Chiluba and M'membe has generated a lot of<BR>interest among civic and political leaders who have criticised FODEP for<BR>the stand it took over the letter written to President Chiluba by<BR>M'membe soon after his Christmas eve ZNBC Night Line Radio programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambia Democratic Congress, the Zambia Civic Education<BR>Association, the National Party, the Liberal Progressive Party, the<BR>United National Independence Party (UNIP), the Zambia Independent<BR>Monitoring Team, the Inter African Network for Human Rights and<BR>Development (Afronet ) and the Catholic Commission for Peace and Justice<BR>have all come out in support of M'membe and criticised FODEP's stand<BR>which they described as &quot;not neutral&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile State House has continued to run full page articles in the<BR>government owned and controlled newspapers accusing M'membe of being<BR>unpatriotic and of waging an international &quot;anti-Zambia campaign&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Four presidents of opposition parties will today meet to<BR>formalise their common stand on several national issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secretaries of UNIP, Liberal Progressive Front and National Party<BR>have met three times to pave the way for today's meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The first meeting agreed on three issues - voter registration and<BR>Nikuv, constitutional reform and President Frederick Chiluba's<BR>citizenship,&quot; said special assistant for press to UNIP president Muhabi<BR>Lungu. &quot;But we unanimously agreed to suspend discussion of President's<BR>citizenship because it might overshadow serious issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today's meeting follows an earlier meeting between UNIP president<BR>Kenneth Kaunda and LPF president Rodger Chongwe at which an outline of<BR>common understanding was agreed. The two parties were later joined by<BR>the National Party and for today's meeting by the Zambia Democratic<BR>Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yesterday UNIP officials were tight-lipped about the venue of the<BR>meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We cannot announce the venue before the presidents agree,&quot; said<BR>UNIP's vice secretary general Fenwick Chifunda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Lack of visible control, direction and coordination of the<BR>work of the Israeli firm, Nikuv, contracted by the government to prepare<BR>the voters' register and cards is said to be frustrating the work of the<BR>Electoral Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And neither the government, through the office of the Vice-President,<BR>nor the Electoral Commission, through the Elections Office, seems to<BR>have discernible control over, or even knowledge of, the activities of<BR>Nikuv. And this apparent 'mystery' over Nikuv seems to be compounding<BR>the fears of the opposition that the ruling MMD wants to use the firm<BR>to rig the elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This 'invisible' control of Nikuv also seems to be one of the major<BR>obstacles to the smooth completion of the exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Electoral Commission and Elections Office's lack of supervisory<BR>powers over Nikuv is said to have left the commissioners and officers<BR>frustrated. Issues of control of Nikuv, funding, cards distribution and<BR>registration appear to be the worrisome issue at play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have nothing to do with either the contract to register voters or<BR>Nikuv,&quot; said chairman of the Electoral Commission, justice Weston<BR>Muzyamba in a telephone interview last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is not only the Electoral Commission and the Elections Office<BR>that knows little, or nothing, about Nikuv, the permanent secretary in<BR>the office of the Vice-President, to whom the firm is believed to be<BR>reporting, also seems to be uneasy about the firm's voters' registration<BR>business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am not in a better position to discuss the subject. You have<BR>caught me off hand. I am not able to comment,&quot; said permanent secretary<BR>in the office of the Vice-President, Philip Daka, in a telephone<BR>interview last Friday. He was asked to comment, among other issues, on<BR>the government's ability to distribute the 4 million cards to voters who<BR>exercise estimates to registered by next week Wednesday. And the cards<BR>would only be available for distribution to the registered voters<BR>sometime in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties have expressed worry that some voters may not<BR>return to registration centres to collect their cards and they fear for<BR>the security of those cards whose owners would either have died or are<BR>unable to collect them for one reason or another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Electoral Commission, although appearing unhappy with this<BR>arrangement, is not prepared to criticise it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is what has been decided by government. Find out from the<BR>government chief spokesman if the elections commission was involved in<BR>this,&quot; said Electoral Commission spokesman Joel Sikazwe said in an<BR>interview last week. The Electoral Commission and Elections Office's<BR>frustration were also noticed and observed by leaders of the opposition<BR>who they met last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I noticed the difficult circumstances they are working under and it<BR>showed they were not happy about the arrangement,&quot; Zambia Democratic<BR>Congress deputy secretary Azwell Banda observed in an interview last<BR>week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They said they had recommended the issuance of cards immediately<BR>after registration but the government refused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But not even Nikuv officials, based at Lusaka's Hotel<BR>Intercontinental, are willing to explain their activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am also a technician and I cannot say anything. I don't know what<BR>it has to do with you, anyway,&quot; said projects manager, Setton, in an<BR>interview last week when asked to explain his firm's role. &quot;Are you a<BR>Christian, the Bible says don't force.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Trade at the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) has been seriously<BR>affected by the low number of companies being floated there and the<BR>general poor state of the economy, experts have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LuSE general manager Charles Mate and Finance Securities general<BR>manager Nduba Namoonde said, in separate interviews, on Wednesday that<BR>an increase in the number of listed companies from the present two,<BR>Chilanga Cement and Rothmans of Pall Mall, and the stabilisation of the<BR>economy could boost the level of activity on the LuSE.<BR>And Mate said companies on the stock exchange could be likened to<BR>commodities and &quot;the wider the variety on offer, the more likely the<BR>public was to being attracted to trade in them&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Mate said the stock exchange cannot dictate to the<BR>government through the Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund the pace at which<BR>companies should be floated to the public because this was their<BR>prerogative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year Zambia Oxygen, Zambia Sugar and Zambia Breweries shares are<BR>expected to be listed on the stock exchange but their timetables is yet<BR>to be announced.<BR>Mate also said the stabilisation of the economy through a reduction in<BR>inflation which in-turn could lead to a drop in interest rates would<BR>present shares as an attractive option to the traditional method of<BR>saving money in Zambia which is through maintaining bank accounts. &quot;The<BR>wider participation of individuals in share ownership was an important<BR>objective of the privatisation programme which the LuSE was there to<BR>facilitate by enabling as many people as possible have access to shares<BR>in companies being privatised,&quot; Mate said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namoonde said there is need for tax concessions to companies go<BR>public if the stock exchange is to develop. &quot;For the stock exchange to<BR>grow the government needs to create a conducive atmosphere through tax<BR>concessions for companies which want to float their shares to the public<BR>on the exchange,&quot; he said. &quot;The government should give tax relief to<BR>companies floating their shares to the public so that more are willing<BR>to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, Namoonde said the government could help put public<BR>confidence into the exchange by stabilising the economy so that people<BR>do not simply concentrate on consumption but also start saving even by<BR>way of share ownership.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - About 7 million Maximum Condoms were used in Zambia in 1995<BR>alone, racking in about K52.5 million of income to local maximum agents,<BR>the Zambia Social Marketing Projects (ZSMP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And ZSMP has taken another step further to Reality, a female condom.<BR>&quot;We've six months in which to access the market for Reality , but it is<BR>selling well in our outlets,&quot; said ZSMP marketing manager, Chris Mukkuli<BR>in an interview yesterday. &quot;For instance we sold about 1, 500 packets of<BR>Reality in December, and we hope that it will improve though there are<BR>more men buying it than women.&quot; Mukkuli also disclosed that there has<BR>been overwhelming response from the public in Maximum Condoms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We sold 6.7 million condoms in 1995. The level of acceptance and<BR>awareness is so high that every sexually active person would want to use<BR>the Maximum Condom,&quot; said Mukkuli. &quot;That it is our business to see<BR>people using condoms to prevent the spread of the deadly diseases and<BR>promote family planning. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the stores manager at S.J Patel Supermarket, Henry Mangani, is<BR>delighted by the figure sold which is close to the national population<BR>of<BR>about 8 million people.<BR>&quot;We're proud that Zambia Social Marketing Project has sold 7 million<BR>condoms and I feel we've contributed to this figure as we've sold<BR>maximum condoms since they were introduced on the market,&quot; said Mangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year's figure accounts for over 50 per cent of all the sales<BR>ZSMP made between 1992 when it launched maximum and 1994. Between this<BR>period ZSMP sold only 12.2 million condoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maximum is also changing the packaging of the condoms to make it even<BR>more appealing and convenient to carry. &quot;We will this year change from<BR>the square shaped box to a pillow shaped package which will be more<BR>convenient for the consumer to carry,&quot; Mukkuli said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - If Kabunda Kayongo, the fourth minister in as many years at<BR>science and technology ministry, keeps her end of year promise to the<BR>information technology (IT), 1996 could be the dawn of a promising era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 1, Kayongo used Computers Society of Zambia seventh<BR>computers communications fair as an excuse to declare she will roll out<BR>a national IT policy this year. Could this be another of those empty<BR>slogans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is not an uncharitable question to ask. Incidentally, this is<BR>not the first time government has gone public about the urgent need of<BR>an IT policy. Nor is it true to infer that there is no IT policy at the<BR>moment. It is there - a monumental patchwork of here-today-gone tomorrow<BR>guidelines.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As far as history of both Kaunda and Chiluba administration goes, the<BR>IT portfolio has never been distinctly delegated. The result is that<BR>today four ministers are directly involved with the IT enterprise and<BR>are ostensibly pulling in different directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other than the science and technology ministry, communications and<BR>transport, information and broadcasting, and commerce, trade and<BR>industry, bureaucrats have separately courted the IT community with<BR>different agendas. Computer Society of Zambia, for one, gives the<BR>impression that there is no difference between the four. It collaborates<BR>with any of them as it deems convenient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And there lies the critical problem of lack of focus and absence of<BR>unity of purpose. The knock-on effect is that the IT industry is on the<BR>back step. Witness the confusion on trade tariffs, legislation on<BR>intellectual property rights, the resistance to open the telecoms market<BR>and a discordant skills development effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As far as Penzanomics stretch, a compact disc (CD) bearing Yondo<BR>Sister's music is of the same value as one with Micr-osoft's Office 95<BR>groupware! That is not all. Information and broadcasting ministry sees<BR>no impropriety in lumping computer programmes with poetry and music in<BR>its copyright laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Enter communications and transport ministry. It hand-picks the board<BR>of directors of the Communication Authority, the nat-ion's telecoms<BR>industry regulator, without representation from the native computer<BR>industry. Either the ministry is not convinced computers, communications<BR>and electronic media are converging and that it needs well-versed<BR>advisors in these fields or it has time-warped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When primary and pre-schools across the border in Mozambique and<BR>Namibia are being equipped with donated computer systems-thanks to their<BR>creative bureaucrats- God knows when the ever uncertain private<BR>initiatives of our universities will yield an IT prog-rammes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Far more striking, the guys at SGS and Zambia Revenue Authority do<BR>not care whether our nascent IT industry swims or sinks. Never mind that<BR>there is absolutely no computer hardware manufacturing here to protect<BR>from imports, their business is to make Zambians pay more than even the<BR>manufacturers demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yes, SGS has been instructed to ignore invoice prices demanded by<BR>manufacturers and substitute them with what is in its 'opinion' is the<BR>right value. The reason is that the treasury under Ronald Penza, whom<BR>even MMD vigilantes cannot entrust to lead their obscure finance and<BR>economic committee, must collect more taxes to pay its hopelessly<BR>bloated civil services, finance dubious jaunts etc.<BR>Surprisingly, political rhetoric is heavily skewed towards hoodwinking<BR>a supposedly unassuming populace that this is the ideal climate to lure<BR>foreign investors. What is attractive about setting up a shop where one<BR>has to pay for receiving a call (not sending) on cellular phone? Not in<BR>an age where technology has improved so much that before long the cost<BR>of dialing Lusaka from New York would be the same as ringing one's next<BR>door neighbour, that is not science fiction but reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For inspiration, India is a ready reference point,. Its software<BR>industry grew more than 50 per cent last year posting a turnover of 850<BR>million United States dollars. This is far much more than our export<BR>earnings from copper sales in the<BR>corresponding period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Clergyman and human rights activist Reverend Franklin Membe<BR>yesterday declared he was joining the race for the Zambian presidency in<BR>the forthcoming elections during a press conference at Lusaka's Fairview<BR>Hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Membe said that he had intended to contest for presidency in the year<BR>2001 but has been compelled to do it this year because &quot;the rate at<BR>which the MMD government is going is dangerous&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do not see any seriousness on the part of Chiluba to avert<BR>bloodshed in the country,&quot; Membe said. Asked what his chances were<BR>against MMD's President Chiluba and UNIP's Kenneth Kaunda, Membe said<BR>with adequate funds and a fair election he could win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Its never too late,&quot; he said. &quot; MMD came together in less than a<BR>year.&quot; Membe said he will stand on a political party whose name he will<BR>be announcing soon after completing consultations. And Membe accused<BR>President Chiluba, without adequate proof, of using undemocratic methods<BR>to hold on to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He is recruiting more policemen and soldiers when people are<BR>suffering because he wants to use them to hold on to power,&quot;Membe<BR>said.&quot;Because Kaunda has announced his intention to contest presidency,<BR>there is money for two thousand police officers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reverend Membe is the estranged husband to local government and<BR>housing deputy minister Wendy Sinkala Membe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Let us continue with events of last year. Some dissatisfied<BR>musicians called for the dissolution of the Zambia Union of Musicians (<BR>ZUM ) executive claiming it had mishandled cash and was not representing<BR>the musicians adequately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZUM general secretary, Webster Malama, was even accused of faking the<BR>death of the Sakala Brother so that he could obtain welfare money.<BR>However despite the brahuha, ZUM managed to open a music resource centre<BR>at the Evelyn Hone college to help musicians without instruments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly after, ZUM was given a short in the arm when it received a K4<BR>million grant from the government. However, a planned gig to commemorate<BR>the death of the national team flopped after the organisers, Jah<BR>Entertainment, failed to secure a suitable set of musical instruments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka-based playwright, Maurice Tembo formed a drama group called<BR>Forum For Drama ( FODA ) and lined up a series of programmes which,<BR>however, are yet to see the light of day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year, the Lusaka theatre club degenerated into some rough house<BR>catering for boozers. Club manager, Norris Malauzi admitted that there<BR>was a problem but attributed the lack of artistic activity to the fact<BR>that most of the time the auditorium was booked by outsiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, as matters degenerated, the playhouse was gutted but members<BR>managed to raise K20 million to refurbish the joint. On a brighter note,<BR>playwright Maurice Tembo made an appearance on the British Broadcasting<BR>Corporation television programme &quot;Great Railways Journey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tembo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while Tembo was shining on BBC, a University of Zambia student,<BR>Anderson Ngulube was awarded $5,000 by an American organisation for his<BR>poetry but he was unable to go and receive the award as he could not<BR>raise money for an air ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another author, Beenwell Sinyangwe, had his book &quot;Quills of Desire&quot;<BR>mentioned in the coveted African Book Publishing Records ( ABPR ) while<BR>Zambian artist, Joe Muzala, was invited to the prestigious South African<BR>award exhibition which was held in South Africa sometime in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In August, artistes of all shades converged at the Star Market and<BR>held a two day bash to commemorate the passing of former radio dee jay,<BR>Timmy Mvula. New Generation front man, Frank Chitembwe, flew to the<BR>United Kingdom and recorded a self titled solo album featuring some<BR>Samba, fusion of Zambian rock and gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About the same time too, emergent singer James Ngoma recorded a debut<BR>album entitled &quot;Chamanyazi&quot; which performed relatively well on the local<BR>market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amayenge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Amayenge had to cut short their American tour after they<BR>encountered problems. According to band spokesman, Brian Chilala, their<BR>promoter made off with their earnings while the band leader Chris Chali<BR>had to return home to attend his wife's funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raggamufin don, Daddy Zemus, sold the rights to his &quot;Salaula&quot; LP to a<BR>newly formed promotion outfit Digital Network International but the move<BR>was condemned by most local musicians. For the first time, local<BR>musicians got together and petitioned the Zambia National Broadcasting<BR>Corporation ( ZNBC ) to begin paying them copyright royalties for any<BR>song or video's played on ZNBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly after, chairman of the Zambia Copyrights Society ( ZAMCOPS )<BR>Jagari Chanda, was invited by the World Copyrights Organisation ( WBO )<BR>to attend a copyright seminar in Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towards the end of the year, a white girl was picked to represent<BR>Zambia at the Miss World pageant but the move was not without<BR>controversy. But perhaps the saddest moment of the year was when veteran<BR>singer, Derek Mbao, passed away after an illness while in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Its the saddest moment in the history of Zambian music,&quot; ZUM general<BR>secretary, Webster Malama moaned. And before our tears could dry, the<BR>music fraternity lost yet another good musician in former Witch<BR>guitarist, Emmanuel Makulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tshala Muana</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign singers made forays into the country.  Zairean sassy singer,<BR>Tshala Muana breezed in.  She was followed by another Zairean Yondo<BR>Sister.  A month later Le General, Dafao jetted in.  But his shows were<BR>far from impressive. Zambian singers based in foreign lands also paid a<BR>courtesy call to their<BR>mother land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sweden-based singer Ken Simuyemba came into the country and so did<BR>the Ubale Girls and guitar virtuoso, Rikki Illilonga. The women ganged<BR>up and came up with a project called Women In Music to promote women<BR>musicians.  Shortly after, they organised a talent show for emergent<BR>female musicians artistes at the Chainama hotel.  They have gone<BR>further and organised a tour of the Zimbabwe-based Zairean band, the<BR>Lubumbashi Stars which was be performing at various venues in Lusaka<BR>over the New Year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ras Willie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ras Willie who was facing a charge of trafficking in obscene material<BR>was acquitted by the Lusaka High court after the prosecution failed to<BR>establish a prima facie case against him. The Amayenge's planned tour of<BR>Zimbabwe fell through after the venues they had ear marked for their<BR>shows were booked by other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week saw the crowning of Tamara Kaluba as Miss Universe-Zambia<BR>but the choice did not go down well with most revellers. Lastly but<BR>definitely not the least, the Go Banana's night club and the former<BR>Kuku's night club were given new leases of life after extensive<BR>renovations .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hoping you have caught up with 1995, we look forward to taking you<BR>through 1996 with more and wider entertainment coverage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fashanu's representative a Mace yesterday confirmed the absence of<BR>the uniform saying arrangements were being made to get it from South<BR>Africa.<BR>But FAZ treasurer Musa Kasonka denied that there was no kit for the team<BR>saying it would be picked in Bloemfontein, South Africa.<BR>&quot;It is not true to say we have no kit.

Instead of using the British Reebok we are going to use the<BR>South African one which is better kit than what we had in the last<BR>four-nations competitions,&quot; he said.<BR>Zambia had protested over the poor quality of the kit it had been given<BR>by<BR>Reebok at the Simba four-nations tournament- yellow and green sets.<BR>A Blue Orchid director Mace, currently in the country to finalise the<BR>kit<BR>arrangment to be used by Zambia at next week's Africa Cup of Nations,<BR>confirmed that the kit will be made in South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luaka - Nigeria has been given an ultimatum by the Confederation of<BR>African Football (CAF) to reconsider pulling out of Africa's soccer<BR>tournament in South Africa or face sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CAF gave the military government in Abuja until last evening to<BR>make it's final decision and threatened to suspend the country, which<BR>won the Africa Cup in Tunisia in 1994, from international competitions<BR>for up to six years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ultimatum was communicated to the Nigerian government yesterday<BR>in Younde, Cameroun by CAF president Issa Hayatou and that Guinea was<BR>being drafted to take the place of Nigeria if they did not respond to<BR>the ultimatum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria announced last week that it was withdrawing from the Africa<BR>Cup of Nations on the grounds that South Africa could not gurantee the<BR>safety of the team in the tournament which starts this next week.<BR>Nigeria is favourite to win again this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is believed the Nigerian government was nursing grudges against<BR>South Africa because of the attitude shown by President Nelson Mandela<BR>after nine political activists from the minority Ogoni group were<BR>executed in Nigeria on November 10 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela was at the forefront of a British Commonwealth campaign to<BR>isolate Nigeria after the executions. This led to a souring of relations<BR>between the two countries, both regarded as Africa's super powers.<BR>Officials in South Africa have said the tournament will go ahead with or<BR>without Nigeria. The games will be played in Johannesburg, Bloemfontein,<BR>Durban and Port Elizaberth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - In the past months, State House has been running continuous<BR>advertisements in the government-owned media, especially the Zambia<BR>Daily Mail to refute all &quot;unpleasant&quot; stories carried by The Post on the<BR>government and President Chiluba. The denials are supposedly meant to<BR>discredit The Post and project it as a newspaper on a &quot;malicious<BR>campaign&quot; against Chiluba and his government. In this edition, Zambia<BR>Civic Education Association chairperson Lucy Sichone (right) gives her<BR>view of the newspaper and the propaganda journalism being orchestrated<BR>by State House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post was not my favourite newspaper.  Infact early in 1995 there<BR>was a period when in exercise of my right and freedom to speech, press<BR>and communication, I stopped buying The Post with one other independent<BR>newspaper which I still do not read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I began buying and reading The Post when it came to my attention<BR>that a propaganda department in the tradition of UNIP's Ministry of<BR>National Guidance but renamed productivity department had been<BR>established at tax payers expense for the sole purpose of containing The<BR>Post Newspaper. A propaganda institution is always established as a<BR>desperate attempt to hide the truth. That is why propaganda journalism<BR>and information dissemination is a unique speciality of vicious<BR>dictatorship such as Hitler's propaganda ministry which marketed murder<BR>of the Jews in gas chambers as hot and refreshing showers for the<BR>victims.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, I considered it my duty to read The Post so that I<BR>could determine the reasons why Richard Sakala was spending scarce<BR>public money at a time when hospitals have no free medicines to give to<BR>under five children on rebutting Post stories especially if the said<BR>stories are not true and are therefore not worth the consideration of<BR>intelligent Zambians like myself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Upon my resumption of reading The Post and upon close scrutiny of the<BR>&quot;Kim II Sung&quot; adverts by the productivity department on the issues<BR>raised by The Post, it became transparently clear to me that the target<BR>of the propaganda is not the substance of The Post stories; the target<BR>is the managing director, Fred M'membe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With all due respect to Fred, I should say that he does not posses<BR>all the awesome qualities and capacity for destruction of Zambia's<BR>integrity as a nation that are attributed to him by Richard Sakala and<BR>Chiluba.  But I am aware that Fred possesses a huge ego that attract<BR>attacks from an individual who believes that he should be the sole<BR>source of power in an alpha/omega sense. That is why in my case Fred is<BR>not my friend, like the apostles of Jesus the two (2) of us would not<BR>agree who between us is the greatest and since I do not manage a<BR>newspaper and I have no money for productivity advertisements to enable<BR>me to settle the issue of who is the greatest between Fred and myself;<BR>it is better we are not friends or foes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coming back to the issue of Fred verses Fred, I was particularly<BR>intrigued by one of Sakala's advertisements which concerned a story in<BR>the International Herald Tribue which reported that the supremo of the<BR>Post Newspapers has been arraigned on so many criminal defamation suits<BR>that he may total up a record 100 years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international Herald Tribune is an &quot;Establishment&quot; paper whose<BR>unquestioned status in the press and media world is aristocratic.  It is<BR>the newspaper which I have observed is served with champagne in the<BR>first class cabin of British Airways as I make my measured and dignified<BR>way to the third class cabin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was concerned therefore that a newspaper of the Herald standard<BR>could devote space and money on a pedestrian story about the possible<BR>imprisonment of some small time editor of a small time newspaper in a<BR>third world country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After much reflection and analysis of the issue, it dawned on me that<BR>the story was not about Fred M'membe and the possibility that he may be<BR>imprisoned for 100 years; the purpose of that international Herald story<BR>was about the current government of the Republic of Zambia and its loss<BR>of credibility, integrity, honest to an extent where the small time<BR>editor of a small time newspaper can rate a total of a 100 years<BR>imprisonment for alleging that the President's father is alive and well<BR>and was mistakenly asking for the fattened pig!!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international Herald could have produced massive copy about<BR>Zambia's loss of good governance by writing about KK's deportation to<BR>Malawi, corruption and drug trafficking, obtaining money by false<BR>pretences ostensibly to write a fictitious constitution to stand the<BR>test of MMD governance; that the Herald did not use any of these serious<BR>and substantive issues to demonstrate Zambia's regression to<BR>dictatorship but instead used copy on mere Fred M'membe is evidence of a<BR>satirical indictment of our governors in the mode and style of Animal<BR>Farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short my dear Richard Sakala the enemy is not M'membe but<BR>yourselves (reference Julius Caesar) The International Herald story, the<BR>non-aligned movement disgust with the intended deportation of KK, the<BR>not accepted constitution, our general loss of international<BR>credibility, voter registration apathy, the tunnels fiasco and M'membe's<BR>International Press Awards, which are irritating to all of us victims of<BR>press freedom are a consequence of government's misdeeds, dishonesty and<BR>incompetence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently, I was horrified to be told by the President himself that<BR>his humiliation at the non-aligned movement conference over the<BR>deportation of KK was a set up by KK himself as it was not government's<BR>intention to consign the former President to Malawi. The reports on KK's<BR>deportation were issued through the government media by government<BR>spokesmen.  I only repeat what I have stated elsewhere that it will not<BR>be possible for this government to change without a true and honesty<BR>confession of its sins of commission and omissions and as long as<BR>Richard Sakala and even Chiluba continues to attribute the consequences<BR>of their misdeeds to KK, M'membe, Sichone (never one to leave myself<BR>out) etc there can never be any salvation for themselves or MMD and we<BR>have KK and UNIP to prove the truism of this political fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The serious problem of the MMD government image as petty, vindictive<BR>and intolerant because of its incompetence will not be resolved by<BR>personal attacks on individual citizens their integrity and/or lack of<BR>it. After all news institutions such as the Herald Tribune , BBC do not<BR>use The Post or Fred M'membe as the source of their copy. Any story<BR>which rates attention of reputable international media is based on<BR>proper research and collection of data on governance, press freedom,<BR>electoral systems and so forth. Personal attacks on individual citizens<BR>merely compound the problem and when the President becomes directly<BR>involved in the propaganda, the Presidency itself is brought into<BR>disrepute. In the circumstances, it becomes completely unacceptable,<BR>indeed it is criminal for the government to abuse tax payers money on<BR>the kind of advertisements that we have seen against The Post and<BR>M'membe when the culprits for our international disgrace are in cabinet,<BR>the police force, electoral commissioner and the public relations unit<BR>at State House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The producer and director of productivity department propaganda<BR>should be reminded that misuse of public funds on personal issues is a<BR>criminal offence. And one of these days, sooner rather than later, there<BR>will be need to answer charges of theft by public servant involving<BR>millions of Kwacha for personal gain. The Nuremburg trials have laid<BR>down the principle that &quot;I was only taking orders&quot; is not an adequate<BR>defence to save the person so accused from imprisonment or capital<BR>punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those advertisements whose only achievements has been to vest Fred<BR>M'membe with abilities and capacities which even the President of the<BR>USA does not possess should come to an end. Attention should be given to<BR>addressing those issues of misgovernance that have given the government<BR>a bad name at<BR>international fora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further and at a personal level, the obssession by the productivity<BR>government and State House with Fred has given him an edge in the<BR>undeclared contest between him and myself as to who is the greatest. In<BR>the circumstances I would have no choice but to commence proceedings<BR>against the Attonery General in which I would pray for the following<BR>orders:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the productivity department should begin immediate<BR>advertisements against me for tarnishing Zambian's Human Rights Record<BR>with my clandestine domestic relations, Sam Ngoma can be retained to do<BR>the necessary copy with his earnings paid directly to the Times of<BR>Zambia to ensure that honest journalists like Hicks Sikazwe continue to<BR>receive their salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the said productivity department should be ordered to arrange a<BR>Nightline programme and address to the nation by the President FTJ<BR>Chiluba in which it can be stated that specially prepared sharp tooth<BR>will be used to sort out the same domestic relations which I am using to<BR>tarnish Zambia's human rights record abroad and traumatising leaders<BR>children like Prince William, Prince Harry, John Major Jnr., Castro etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I will need these orders in order to show Fred M'membe that he is not<BR>the greatest; that all of us ordinary citizens rate the same kind of<BR>attention from our government.I will stop here and once again find<BR>comfort in Byron &quot;if I laugh at any mortal thing, it is that I may not<BR>weep&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - Reeling from the the speed of the recent Sudan People's<BR>Liberation Army (SPLA) offensive in the civil war, the National Islamic<BR>Front (NIF) regime in Khartoum has alternated between crying out for<BR>help from a limited number of friendly states and accusing all and<BR>sundry of aiding and abetting the SPLA in what the regime has described<BR>as a foreign invasion of Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States of America is at the top of the list of Sudan's<BR>enemies, closely followed by Israel, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda and<BR>Egypt. Claiming that the SPLA had neither the means nor the technical<BR>know-how to carry out such an offensive, Khartoum has constructed an<BR>incredible conspiracy theory involving all of the above named states.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Khartoum, Eritrea supplied the SPLA with tanks and<BR>weapons which were transported from Massawa on the coast through<BR>Ethiopia and Uganda and into Southern Sudan. Egyptian Military transport<BR>planes were also used to carry weapons and equipment via Uganda. So far<BR>the regime's propaganda ministry has failed to produce any evidence to<BR>back up its bizarre theory. The regime claims to have captured tanks and<BR>other weapons with Eritrean and Ugandan markings on them, and also<BR>claims to have claims to have killed or captured Eritrean and Ugandan<BR>officers and troops.  However, Khartooum refuses to produce this<BR>evidence for independent verification. This is not surprising because it<BR>is not beyond the regime's capacity to forge such evidence.  At some<BR>point the regime claimed that it had killed 263 Ugandan soldiers at Kit.<BR>The claim was easily ridiculed because a British Broadcasting<BR>Corporation (BBC) news team was at Kit with the (SPLA) forces and could<BR>testify to Khartoum's lies in a &quot;Focus on Africa&quot; programme the<BR>following day,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Khartoum itself, the regime has tried to whip up a hate campaign<BR>against the few US nationals still resident there. The US embassy has<BR>countered this by issuing its own mimeographed statements and widely<BR>distributing them across the Three Towns capital. The US has denied<BR>providing any support for the SPLA or having any involvement with the<BR>opponents of the regime. The US regards Khartoum's allegations as being<BR>counter-productive to the ongoing dialogue designed to improve US-regime<BR>relations<BR> The US has taken Khartoum's threats seriously enough to recall its<BR>ambassador from Sudan for consultation. It is believed that while the<BR>ambassador was in Washington, D.C., he suggested that a forthcoming<BR>visit to the US by SPLA leader Colonel John Garang be canceled. The<BR>ambassador argued that to receive Colonel Garang at a senior level would<BR>give credence to reports of clandestine US support for the SPLA and as<BR>such could enflame the problems in Khartoum. In the event, the SPLA<BR>leader arrived on schedule and was received at the same official level<BR>he is usually accorded. In spite of the ambassador's concerns, it would<BR>appear that the Clinton administration finally took the view that to<BR>cancel the visit would be tantamount to giving in to the regime's<BR>blackmail. That would be an inappropriate way to conduct UA foreign<BR>policy, considering the number of rogue regimes it has to deal with<BR>world-wide. Khartoum protested about the visit, but Washington ignored<BR>them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government of Uganda responded quite sharply to Khartoum's<BR>allegations and threats. In November, it had merely mentioned that it<BR>took Khartoum's threats to invade Uganda seriously and was on the alert<BR>to repel any such invasion. Last month, however, the Ugandans took a<BR>much stronger line and on 6 December a presidential statement demanded<BR>that Khartoum cease its support and assistance for the Lords Resistance<BR>Army (LRA) or Ugandan commandos would be dispatched into Southern Sudan<BR>to deal with the Ugandan rebel group.<BR> &quot;If Khartoum continues to send in these armed bandits to kill our<BR>farmers, women and children in Northern Uganda, and to plant antiin our commandos to pursue, search and destroy the LRA bandits inside<BR>personnel mines in the countryside, we will have no choice but to send<BR>Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unable to motivate or properly supply its ground forces in the South<BR>and the Nuba Mountains, the regime has begun to depend more heavily on<BR>aerial bombardment of civilian targets. The regime has increased the<BR>number of raids it makes each day. In late November and early December,<BR>reports claimed that the regime had begun to use chemical warfare in the<BR>Nuba Mountains. The chemicals are believed to have been supplied by the<BR>Iraqis who have used such weapons against their own internal opponents.<BR>The Iraqis have also provided planes and troops</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former Soviet republic of Belarus has sold ten planes to<BR>Khartoum. They are long range bombers and cost $150,000,000. The deal<BR>was a purely economic one rather than an ideological marriage between<BR>the two countries. As the regime is known to be strapped for cash, this<BR>deal begs the question of where the money to buy the planes actually<BR>came from. It is believed that Iran and the oil rich state of Qatar<BR>split the bill between them. The planes have already been delivered and<BR>have begun bombing raids over the South.  Belarus also supplied<BR>technicians and pilots.<BR> Iran has recently supplied the regime with other military equipment<BR>and weapons. It is also the regime's main supplier of fuel for its<BR>military operations in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Islamic states of Indonesia and Malaysia have also supplied<BR>military equipment to the regime, having been swayed by the NIF's pleas<BR>that its Islamic system is under threat from the infidels and is<BR>therefore worthy of support</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The injection of equipment and weapons has yet to have impact on the<BR>fortunes of the regime in the war. It is doubtful whether they will have<BR>any real impact because in order to utilize the regime needs to have<BR>trained personnel at the battlefront. The regimes forces are demoralized<BR>at present and those in outlying posts are suffering from a shortage of<BR>provisions. The regime's troops are ill fed, ill supplied, ill equipped<BR>and ill motivated whilst operating in the hostile environment of the<BR>South. The recent SPLA victories have only added to their problems and<BR>reduced the morale even further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Juba two battalions of troops have disobeyed orders to move out<BR>into the countryside by spinning out their requisition of necessary<BR>supplies for future operations. These troops were visited in December by<BR>a succession of the regime's leaders in a bid to build up their morale.<BR>Dr. Hussan Abdulla El Turabi and Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, the foreign<BR>minister, both visited Juba. In addition, first vice president General<BR>Zubeir Mohammed Salih led a number of senior military figures on a visit<BR>to the troops,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime's leaders are having to face up to the fact that troops on<BR>active duty in the South are less convinced by propaganda than the<BR>civilians in the North may be. These troops have experienced the reality<BR>of battle at first hand and know that the SPLA is a committed enemy<BR>fighting for a cause it believes in. They feel less enamored by their<BR>own cause and the brainwashing about angels and infidels they received<BR>before coming south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum's forces have very good reasons for feeling demoralized. A<BR>conventional army used to regular supplies and meals is now having to<BR>make do on subsistence rations. Whereas their enemy, the SPLA is used to<BR>such hard conditions, Khartoum's forces are not.  In many outlying<BR>military posts, the regimes troops are surviving on bread and hot onion<BR>sauce served once a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The troops have also been immobilized by a fuel shortage and most of<BR>the transport vehicles are inactive. The troops have to carry out all<BR>their operations on foot. Ammunition is in short supply, replacement<BR>uniforms are non-existent and the conventional army now looks more like<BR>a poorly supplied guerrilla army than the SPLA does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports last month have spoken of large scale desertion by the<BR>regime's forces around Juba and they are trying to make their way back<BR>to Northern Sudan by whatever means available. In November, seventy<BR>soldiers returning to Juba from a defeat at Pageri boarded a steamer<BR>bound for the North rather than report to the Army HQ. The steamer was<BR>halted down river at Bor, eighty miles north of Juga, where the soldiers<BR>were arrested and detained. The regime fears that is demoralized troops<BR>return to the North and publicize the true situation in the war, then<BR>the public will clamor for peace and recruits for the army will be even<BR>harder to find that they are already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime has uncharacteristically issued a statement about the<BR>situation in both Kapoeta and Torit denying that there is any military<BR>confrontation with the SPLA around the two towns. The statement<BR>denounced the people who have been undermining the regime's war efforts.<BR>The denial was unsolicited and might shed further light on the situation<BR>if it is looked at in a more critical majjer. Why bother to deny<BR>something that has not been publicized by the enemy unless there is some<BR>truth in it? The SPLA has only reported on actual battle successes and<BR>has seen no need to make sweeping statements about the overall situation<BR>in the war. It is the regime which feels the need to do this and it is<BR>surely a sign of its own concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The battle fronts around Kaya, Kajokeji and Morobo have been quiet.<BR>Independent reports have revealed that the SPLA has put all three towns<BR>under siege together with the strategic town of Yei. Any SPLA victories<BR>in this sector would have positive repercussions on the situation in<BR>Western Equatoria and Bahr El Ghazal, as far as the guerrilla army is<BR>concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attempts by the regime to distract attention away from Eastern<BR>Equatoria by launching offensives in Bahr El Ghazal and against Western<BR>Equatoria have so far failed. The attempts to arrange, through bribery,<BR>bases in the Central African Republic and Zaire, in order to launch<BR>attacks on Western Equatoria, have so far proved fruitless. The local<BR>officials have noted Khartoum's generosity and have made higher demands<BR>for payment. Khartoum's financial resources are limited and each time<BR>its representatives return to Sudan for more money, they get back to the<BR>CAR and Zaire to be faced by new officials, all expecting some kind of<BR>payment. Bribery is proving to be an expensive and inefficient way of<BR>conducting the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPLA is still in control of Western Equatoria and its forces are<BR>ready for the regime's offensives from whatever direction. The most<BR>likely routes are from Wau across the Bo River, or from Rumbek, although<BR>the direct route from Juba via Rokon, Mundri and Maridi might also be<BR>targeted. There is an old hilly route from Yei to Maridi which the SPLA<BR>is also monitoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The schism in the SPLA in 1991 handed much of Upper Nile to the<BR>regime because the SPLA-United forces, later to be renamed the Southern<BR>Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM), chose to work with the regime<BR>against the mainstream SPLA. Commander Nyuon's forces have since April<BR>1995 been controlling the overland route from Malakal to Bor and on to<BR>Kapoeta and Torit, by being in control of Ayot, Akobo and Watt. His<BR>forces are even siad to have reached as far North as the Zaraf Island of<BR>Panjak. In order to take advantage of this overland route in the dry<BR>season, the regime now has to fight its way for almost the entire 300<BR>kilometers from Malakal. Commander Nuyon's SSIM forces are reported to<BR>have reached Doleib Hill, some fifteen hundred kilometers from Malakal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime's propaganda machine has released many stories in recent<BR>weeks reporting that 30,000 fresh troops have been airlifted to Juba,<BR>ready to take the battle to the SPLA.  The story made impressive reading<BR>for the Northern public but did little to threaten the SPLA in Eastern<BR>Equitoria because the truth is somewhat different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In reality, the regime's press gangs in the North have rounded up<BR>any male aged fourteen to twenty-one foolish enough to be seen in<BR>public. They have been dragged out of homes and schools or mearly<BR>rounded up off the streets. Instead of taking them to training camps in<BR>the North, they have been immediately airlifted to camps in Juba, from<BR>where there is little chance of escape. Forcibly enlisted into the<BR>Popular Defense Forces (PDF), they are being given rudimentary<BR>instruction on how to fire a rifle before being despatched to the<BR>battlefront. It is little wonder that the PDF's causality and mortality<BR>rates have been so high and its forces so ineffective. More than 3,000<BR>youngsters died on the battlefield at Awingbul alone in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the unspoken tragedies of this press gang policy is that the<BR>relatives of the young men have no idea what has happened to them or<BR>where they actually are. Those lucky enough to go to a camp in the North<BR>rather than straight to the South are kept incommunicado from their<BR>parents and relatives who are not allowed to visit them. Inquisitive<BR>relatives are told that the young men have volunteered to train for the<BR>jihad. Parents of underage boys are told that they are undertaking their<BR>compulsory national military training in order to qualify them for their<BR>next stage of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whilst the regime's policy is quite successful at getting the young<BR>men to the South, it is less adept at motivating them to fight, even for<BR>the jihad. Once the young men have been exposed to rotting corpses,<BR>badly wounded contemporaries and a highly motivated enemy, they become<BR>utterly demoralized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the regime's oft-quoted desire to send a one million strong<BR>militia force to the South, the SPLA continues to survive and fight<BR>back, leaving many observers to wonder why the regime even bothers to<BR>suggest it. mere numbers have proved to be insufficient in the heat of<BR>battle. Morale and motivation have proved to be far more significant<BR>and on both counts the SPLA is leaps and bounds ahead of the regime's<BR>forces.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - MEMORY: Luba Art and the Making of History is the first<BR>American exhibition to present the art and culture<BR>of the Luba of Zaire and the first ever to explore how Luba works of art<BR>function in the reconstruction of memory and history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Luba Sculpture is among the most beautiful of African arts, it<BR>also reveals astounding philosophical complexity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Luba, one of the<BR>most important kingdoms of central Africa (southeastern Zaire) from the<BR>17th through 19th centuries, highly value the recounting of royal<BR>history, and encode its complexity on an array of stunning art objects<BR>created precisely to stimulate and guide memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MEMORY presents over 100 of these unique objects which enable the<BR>Luba to remember and re-interpret their collective past. Memory boards,<BR>beaded emblems, ornamented royal scepters and axes, thrones, divination<BR>instruments' wooden figures and body arts each have a particular visual,<BR>tactile and spatial vocabulary. It is this incised, symbolic coding<BR>system that helps the Luba remember the esoteric information, pivotal<BR>events, royal personages and political relationships that make up their<BR>collective history and individual identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Museum for African art is located at 593 Broadway (between<BR>Houston and Prince). General Admission is $4; $2 for children, students<BR>and senior citizens.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - From humble beginnings in Venda, Ntsudzuluseni Ndou is<BR>heading for the Olympics in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Venda Ntsudzuluseni means &quot;take me to another place&quot;, and for<BR>Ntsudzuluseni Ndou boxing has done just that. The 18-year-old from<BR>Thoyandou is Atlanta-bound in July as a member of South Africa's Olympic<BR>team after winning the silver medal in the featherweight division at the<BR>All Africa Games in Harare last September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndou is better known by his English name of Philip, which is easier<BR>on the tongue for most people. The tall matriculant is lean and mean and<BR>uses his long reach to stay out of trouble. He is confident about his<BR>prospects in Atlanta. &quot;I think I will do well at the Olympics because I<BR>know there is nobody in Africa who is better than me,&quot; says Ndou.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A strange statement you might think for someone who was beaten to the<BR>gold medal at the All Africa Games, but for anyone who saw his final<BR>against Egypt's Saleh Abdelbary it is not surprising at all. To say he<BR>was cheated of victory is something of an understatement. &quot;It was the<BR>worst decision I've seen in 45 years of amateur boxing,&quot; says national<BR>team manager Dan Bushney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndou completely dominated the fight but when it came to adding the<BR>points from the scoring machines of the five judges it was clear that<BR>some of the North African judges were less than impartial in their<BR>observations. &quot;It wasn't a hard fight for me. My hardest fight came in<BR>the semi-final against the Mauritian who was a very tough opponent. I<BR>found the final very easy in comparison but the judges robbed me. They<BR>said I was the loser but everyone else who saw the fight said I was the<BR>winner. The guys from Egypt and Tunisia just didn't want South Africa to<BR>win,&quot; says Ndou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such controversial decisions have long been part and parcel of<BR>amateur boxing. But internationally the situation has improved now with<BR>a wider spread of judges and fewer ideological divisions around the<BR>globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new scoring system introduced at the Barcelona Olympics has also<BR>made it difficult to rig results. Now, for a scoring blow to count,<BR>three out of the five judges must hit the button on their scoring<BR>machines within one second. In Africa though there is a dominance of<BR>officials from North African countries and they are accused of helping<BR>each others' boxers at the expense of other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Bushney, the only way to change this is to get more<BR>judges from the rest of Africa onto the African Boxing Confederation's<BR>panel which is an issue that South Africa intends addressing in the near<BR>future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was Ndou's victory over Josian Lebon of Mauritius in the semia strong and experienced fighter but Ndou fought intelligently to turn<BR>final which impressed observers though. The short, stocky Mauritian was<BR>the tables on him. Ndou used body blows and moved quickly to tire him<BR>and kept him at arm's length so he couldn't land too many telling blows.<BR>&quot;It was a difficult fight because we both knew each other's styles after<BR>sparring together at our training camp in Kroonstad before the All<BR>Africa Games. But Bodo (national team coach Bodo Andreass) had watched<BR>him closely in Kroonstad and he altered my style a little to confuse him<BR>and I just fought to my strengths,&quot; says Ndou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndou only got into the national team last year after winning the<BR>South African title as a 16- year-old in 1993 and retaining it in 1994.<BR>He puts much of his recent improvement down to the arrival of Andreass<BR>at the end of 1994. Andreass is a former East German amateur boxer who<BR>spent four years coaching the Nigerian national team which won two<BR>silver medals at the Barcelona Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He came to South Africa at the request of the National Olympic<BR>Committee of South Africa (Nocsa) which seconded him to the South<BR>African National Amateur Boxing Organisation (Sanabo) under its<BR>Operation Excellence programme. &quot;He is a very experienced coach and he<BR>knows a lot about boxing. He has really taught me a lot and that is why<BR>I did well in Harare. I think Nocsa should keep him on after Atlanta<BR>because our results have really started to improve under him,&quot; says<BR>Ndou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lessons he has learnt from Andreass are also starting to pay off<BR>at the Makwarela Boxing Club in Thoyandou where he coaches the other<BR>boxers in a makeshift club house in one of the classrooms at his school.<BR>&quot;I have improved so much with Bodo and everything he has taught me I<BR>also teach my boxers here in Venda. I show them how to train properly<BR>and now we have two juniors and six seniors who are the best in Venda.<BR>This year they will go to the South African championships and I know<BR>they are going to do well,&quot; says Ndou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now though Ndou's eyes are focused far beyond the national<BR>championships and on the Olympic Games which are now just over six<BR>months away. &quot;It is a great honour to fight for your country at the<BR>Olympics and it is important not to let your country down. I must go to<BR>Atlanta and work hard to show people what it means to be a South African<BR>champion and make people respect this country,&quot; says Ndou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Ntsudzuluseni Ndou can do anything like as well as he did in<BR>Harare in the much more demanding Olympic arena he won't have to worry<BR>about being taken to another place. He will be made for life and have<BR>his name etched indelibly in the annals of local sporting legend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A host of Africa's top stars will converge on South<BR>Africa next week for the African Nations Cup finals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Kenya's sports minister Hussein Maalinm Mohamed said that his<BR>country was withdrawing from hosting the African Nations Cup, because of<BR>a lack of funds, the Confederation of African Football (Caf) did not<BR>hesitate to appoint South Africa in their place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If South Africa succeeds in its handling of the tournament, it may<BR>well be the recipe for hosting the 2006 World Cup. Caf president Issa<BR>Hayatou has already given his full backing to South Africa's bid to host<BR>the world's biggest soccer bonanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for now the 20th African Nations Cup showdown starts next<BR>Saturday at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg, with South Africa against<BR>Cameroon, the two-time winners of this tournament and 1990 World Cup<BR>quarter- finalists against England. Cameroon won the tournament in 1984<BR>and 1988.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa will be hoping to increase to seven the number of<BR>countries to have won the tournament as hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Black Stars of Ghana, four-time winners, first won the<BR>championship in 1963 when it was held in Accra. They also hosted and won<BR>it in 1978. Together with Egypt they share the privilege of being the<BR>only countries that have defended the title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Black Stars will be looking to Leeds striker Tony Yeboah and<BR>captain Abedi Pele Ayew. They come to the tournament having last claimed<BR>it in 1982 when it was hosted by Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hoping to equal the winning ways of Ghana are the three-time winners<BR>the Pharoahs of Egypt who hosted the cup in 1959 and 1986, and made sure<BR>on both occasions that it stayed there. Egypt also won it on its<BR>inception in 1957 in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Algeria won the cup in 1990, failed in Senegal in 1992, before a<BR>total nightmare in Tunisia 94 when they were banned for using an<BR>ineligible player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two other teams from Southern Africa have made it to the finals<BR>despite the politcal upheavals that have been taking place in their<BR>countries. Angola deserve all the support they can get from their fans.<BR>In the words of South African coach Clive Barker they &quot;must surely be<BR>ranked the darkest horses of the tournament&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique will give a few of their opponents a run for their money,<BR>taking into account their recent performance against South Africa who<BR>beat them 3-2 after the visitors had taken the lead twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa is once again surrounded by controversy with the<BR>chairman of the technical committee of the South African Football<BR>Association, Jomo Sono, who also serves as an adviser to Barker, not<BR>being informed of the final selection of the squad. The surprise<BR>exclusion of Brendon Augustine of Umtata Bucks was also a surprise to<BR>many. The insistence on including Lucas Radebe of Leeds United despite<BR>doubts about his fitness has also raised eyebrows. The Leeds coach has<BR>reservations about Radebe's ability to keep pace with the demands of the<BR>tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tunisia, who have been hosts twice and have never won the cup, will<BR>be hoping to put all the traumas of 1994 behind them. They are in the<BR>same group as Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, both of whom are favourites to<BR>finish first and second in the group forcing Tunisia to pack their bags<BR>early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gabon was the first team to pack their bags in Tunisia and the gods<BR>must surely have turned their backs on them. They are in the same group<BR>as the reigning champions Nigeria..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests over the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other activists in<BR>Nigeria have made their team's participation in the tournament doubtful.<BR>Nigeria is to make a decision on Friday whether they are coming or not<BR>and, if they decline, then Guinea will be the replacements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the Ivory Coast players come from the Asec Mimosa club and<BR>one wonders how their coach Pierre Pleimelding will be able to mentally<BR>refocus some of the players whose guts and determination were tested to<BR>the full when they recently lost to Orlando Pirates in the Champions<BR>Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The stars of the tournament may well be Liberia, inspired by the<BR>European and African footballer of the year George Weah. They nearly<BR>withdrew from the tournament because of finance, and Weah had to dig dip<BR>into his pocket to make sure that Liberia make the best of their first<BR>appearance at the finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After many of the team members had been killed in a plane crash in<BR>Gabon in 1993, Zambia nearly won the cup in Tunisia when they were<BR>beaten 2-1 by Nigeria in the finals. Having come so close to winning the<BR>cup in 1994, this may well be their chance to lift it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burkina Faso come to the finals as the only team with an unbeaten<BR>record in the qualifying matches and are the first team from Africa to<BR>have qualified for the World Cup in 1974 in Germany. They have eight<BR>foreign-based players in their team. They will be counting on Seydou<BR>Traore who plays for FC Bressuirein in France and Abdoulaye Kassoum<BR>Ouerdraogo who is based in Germany with FSV Franfurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire has won the cup twice, in 1968 and 1974. They were booted out<BR>in the quarter- final stage by eventual winners Nigeria in 1994. In the<BR>qualifying stages they beat Morocco at home, before going on to draw<BR>with Ivory Coast. Among some of their foreign-based players are Ngole<BR>Kona of Genderbirligi in Turkey and Mbote Ndinga of Vitoria Guimaraes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sierra Leone will be coming to the finals for the second time. They<BR>also nearly withdrew from the tournament for financial reasons. Kewullay<BR>Conteh of Atalanta in Italy and Lamine Conteh of SV Meppen in Germany<BR>will lead their team.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Paul Adams has brought unbridled enthusiasm and joy to<BR>a team which already has grit and courage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is well as we move into a new year to savour some of the tragedies<BR>and failures of the 12 months just past. For the cricketers contesting<BR>the current series, the breaking of a savage countrywide drought has<BR>been an unwanted hindrance. For the squatters of Maritzburg it has meant<BR>total devastation and, in well over 100 cases, loss of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But on both admittedly widely different counts, one cannot but<BR>rejoice in the resilience of the human condition. The surviving<BR>squatters are hastily rebuilding their shattered lives and a nation<BR>mourns for them as they fight their way out of the morass of a<BR>catastrophic natural disaster.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And surely, no South African -- no matter how insensitive -- can see<BR>the lack of playing days the heavens have allowed against the touring<BR>English under Mike Atherton against any other backdrop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yes, the cricket is important and as lifegiving in its own way as the<BR>waters which have, in their overabundance after almost a decade of arid<BR>refusal, abruptly taken the lives of so many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yes, it is important to all of us in this emergent admix of<BR>peoples and tongues, cultures and conditioning, that the nation have<BR>success to show in the face of such adversities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For as the flood-ravaged communities on the banks of the Umsunduzi<BR>tackle their devastated lives anew, cricket has been given a like chance<BR>to present a renewal of spirit to graft onto the courage and fortitude<BR>which has marked the ethos of this country's teams since our<BR>readmittance in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has not been an easy series to quantify and certainly not an easy<BR>one for the players of both sides to contest. The disappointment of the<BR>rained-out first and third tests at Centurion Park and Kingsmead have<BR>been one factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refusal of Atherton and his English batesman to bow to the raw<BR>pace of the South Africans has been another. Certainly, Atherton's<BR>unbeaten 185-run, 10-hour 44-minute stay at the crease to deny a result<BR>at the Wanderers in an innings of true cricketing integrity is not an<BR>individual effort which will be lightly discounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither can you lightly dismiss the maiden century by the gritty Gary<BR>Kirsten at the Wanderers or his two half-centuries which earned him the<BR>Man of the Match award in the drawn fourth Test at St George's Park last<BR>week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was in the disappointment of Port Elizabeth with yet another<BR>Test without a result in a series which had rapidly been running out of<BR>steam that the essence of rebirth came to light. And fitting that St<BR>George's Park, the venue for the first international this country ever<BR>played when they took the field against CA Smith's English invaders back<BR>in 1889, should have provided it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For two things made this meeting between South Africa and England<BR>different from any international played before. The first was a chubbyFlats with the strangled action of a capsized terrapin.<BR>faced youngster from the humble environs of Grassy Park on the Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second was a muscular politician with thick spectacles, a voice<BR>like broken glass and a former postal address on an isolated island not<BR>far off the coast from the mountain which looms large over Newlands<BR>where the two teams are currently engaged in the series decider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul Adams became the youngest player to wear cricket's green and<BR>gold at 18 years and 340 days. It was only his sixth first-class match,<BR>an honour he rightly earned and, many would argue, two tests overdue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coach Bob Woolmer summed it up in one succinct phrase: &quot;He looked<BR>like he's played Test cricket for 15 years,&quot; he said. Indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adams took a modest four wickets on a flat and unresponsive pitch in<BR>his debut, but in this performance, there was the roots of a renaissance<BR>in the game. Adams plays the game with the unbridled enthusiasm and<BR>inner joy which its originators in the Vale of Hambledon surely intended<BR>for the world's most glorious game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this alone, Adams has something to give back to the team which the<BR>exposure to the professional pragmatism of the English and the cynical<BR>sledging of the Aussies have taken from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be both premature and unpardonable to heap all the<BR>responsibility for ensuring this new spirit follows through on his young<BR>shoulders, but the sight of captain Hansie Cronje's smile when Adams<BR>dismissed Graham Thorpe to register what we must believe will be the<BR>first of many Test victims was evidence enough that the young man has a<BR>special magic about him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, just for a moment review the new life Adams injected into the St<BR>George's Park brass ensemble. The music even had Jonty Rhodes turning<BR>Mapantsula in the field. If this is the new voice of South African<BR>cricket, long may that voice roar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which brings us to the second man in the equation, Minister of Sport<BR>Steve Tshwete. Tshwete has never been shy of tacking his flag to the<BR>mast. He cried openly at South Africa's early cricketing successes and,<BR>though an avowed rugby man, has been one of the great advocates of the<BR>game under the new dispensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tshwete forsook the padded seats of the official enclave, shed his<BR>jacket and took to the stands to join the extended membership band, wave<BR>the flag and add his voice to the on-going celebration that was the very<BR>heart of this dull draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One shudders to think of the discord Tshwete's vocal cords engendered<BR>in his immediate surroundings. But in Tshwete doing what he did, there<BR>was the very embodiment of what Krish Mackerdhuj and Ali Bacher had<BR>claimed as administrators and Kepler Wessels, Cronje and the teams they<BR>have led have attempted so ardently and so well to put into practice as<BR>players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is well that Newlands -- incidentally the venue of this country's<BR>second Test against Smith's tourists before the turn of the century --<BR>has become so vital in the equation of the current England tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No cricket lover would begrudge the fact that a ground which retains<BR>its beauty and majesty despite the ravages development has wrought,<BR>should be the place to settle matters once and for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is home to Adams, Kirsten and Brian McMillan -- perhaps the only<BR>player alongside Donald who can claim true world class among the South<BR>Africans during this series -- although the young spin bowler can only<BR>claim a fleeting relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crux of the issue though is not that Kirsten and McMillan have<BR>got centuries. Or that Atherton and Graeme Hick -- a superb 141 at<BR>Centurion Park -- have managed their top scores in Test cricket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither does it hinge on wicketkeeper Jack Russell's world record 11<BR>dismissals behind the stumps to some wayward South African batting and<BR>his stubborn refusal to leave the crease after Meyrick Pringle had given<BR>him an early life in the same match. Or even that Shaun Pollock is<BR>developing into both a frighteningly dangerous new ball exponent and a<BR>polished lower middle order bat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It all really hangs on a contrast of attitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> England have always seemed to be playing not to lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The naggingly negative line adopted by Dominic Cork -- far and away<BR>the best of the England bowlers on tour -- and Richard Illingworth in<BR>the second innings at St George's is as much evidence of this as the way<BR>the tourists have packed their batting line-up and consistently refused<BR>to employ the erratic power and pace of Devon Malcolm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cronje and his side have played to win. That they have not yet<BR>managed this is proof of Woolmer's contention that they are not a<BR>collection of individual stars, but rather a cohesive, tough and<BR>sometimes uncompromising collective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this, perhaps Cronje and his men embody on the sportsfield, the<BR>refusal to lie down in adversity which has been shown by the sad spectre<BR>of the squatters on the banks of the Duzi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For these are as much the people our current crop -- Hansie Cronje,<BR>Gary Kirsten, Andrew Hudson, Daryll Cullian, Jonty Rhodes, Brian<BR>McMillan, Dave Richardson, Shaun Pollock, Craig Matthews, Allan Donald,<BR>Jacques Kallis, Nicky Boje and Paul Adams -- are playing for as the 100<BR>000-plus who bought tickets for Newlands before a ball was bowled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And who all the future wearers of the national flag -- above whatever<BR>emblem the officials come up with next -- must strive to represent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The advent of Adams has shown what is attainable. And that cricket in<BR>this country can truly be for all, politician or pleb. There is new life<BR>in the old game yet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A levelling of the playing fields is necessary for<BR>black businesses to succeed, argues Dr Nthato Motlana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairman of New Africa Investments Limited (Nail), Dr Nthato Motlana<BR>is not out of the running for industrial finance company Johnnic. He<BR>told the Mail &amp; Guardian recently that he is planning to raise R6mining house Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI) has been<BR>billion for a stake in Johnnic, one of the three companies into which<BR>unbundled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnnic controls Times Media Limited and the South African Breweries<BR>among others. Motlana says R3-billion of the capital will come from Nail<BR>and its subsidiaries, one of which, Metropolitan -- which controls<BR>Methold -- has over R8-billion in net assets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motlana does not hide his political leanings which, over the past<BR>couple of weeks, saw him being accused of meddling with the editorial<BR>freedom of The Sowetan newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was alleged that Motlana had been under pressure from the African<BR>National Congress to force Sowetan staff to &quot;toe the ANC line&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While he admits to having been approached by President Nelson Mandela<BR>who raised problems with some of the Sowetan's articles, the man who<BR>says he was once seen as &quot;the Trojan horse who acquired the paper on<BR>behalf of the ANC&quot;, denies any interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How do his ventures benefit the black community? Irate, he replies:<BR>&quot;Whenever anybody goes into business, he goes for himself. Anyone who<BR>pretends to the contrary is a liar or a fool. Write that down, and go<BR>and tell them!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pauses, then bursts into laughter, apparently regretful at his<BR>cantankerous outburst. Then slowly, he continues: &quot;Anyone who does not<BR>sleep, preparing and going from meeting to meeting, is doing it for<BR>himself. What happens to other people is as a result of your own<BR>personal empowerment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, Motlana opposed a move by Anglo American to transfer 20<BR>percent of The Sowetan shares to a black community trust with<BR>beneficiaries such as the Educational Opportunities Council, the Get<BR>Ahead Foundation and a host of homes for the mentally handicapped,<BR>arguing that black &quot;entrepreneurs&quot;, like their white counterparts,<BR>should have the opportunity of real ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motlana denies purchasing the impoverished weekly New Nation, now a<BR>sister publication of the Sowetan, because of ANC pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The losing gamble was owing to the role the paper played in the<BR>transformation of the country, he says, but if it does not recover in<BR>the next six months, &quot;we'll forget it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'You know,&quot; he says with a smile, &quot;I've paid my dues to my community<BR>and my country. I cannot understand why they don't pick on (Real Africa<BR>Group chairman) Don Ncube, Thebe Investments, or the Kunene Brothers. Is<BR>it obscene to make money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are others who make money but they don't go ask them what they<BR>do for the community, they do that only to Motlana. They must go to<BR>hell, man!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm sick and tired of Sam Shilowa and Zwelinzima Vavi. Sick! Sick!<BR>Sick! When they get stuck in the middle of a speech they insert Motlana,<BR>whoaaa! Whether they do not have the intelligence to think further than<BR>Motlana, I can't understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motlana had been foretold, he claims, by people like international<BR>businessman Tony O'Reilly, that he would be hated for his business<BR>acumen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sometimes I get mad when people think I started being involved in<BR>business because the ANC was unbanned and Nelson Mandela got out of<BR>prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My first company was called Phaphama Afrika Commercial Enterprises,<BR>formed in the 60s, when it was almost impossible to do so. You had to<BR>kick shins and push hard, there were no loans for black people and no<BR>premises in town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm chairman of Lesedi Clinic, the first black-owned private clinic<BR>in this country. I'm the founder chairman of the 80 000-member Sizwe<BR>Medical Aid Fund. We built the Takalani home for the mentally<BR>handicapped in Soweto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When people ask me, how do you benefit your community? I say look<BR>back at my record: I've been involved in politics since age 18; detained<BR>as secretary of the ANC Youth League; on the dock with Mandela in the<BR>'Sisulu and 19 others' trial of 1952; once was chairman of 18 community<BR>organisations; formed the Get Ahead Foundation; went around the world<BR>and collected money to create a fund that helped people like Sakkie<BR>Macozoma get a Masters degree in Communication.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even before Black Like Me, we started Africare, the first black hair<BR>products manufacturing company. We did not succeed because banks would<BR>not give us money, our guys did not have MBAs, and we had no marketing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nail's hopes to raise the capital needed to purchase a stake at<BR>Johnnic were once dashed by capital constraints, he says. &quot;I hope people<BR>will not say the Motlana group is being favoured. We have that critical<BR>mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If we don't do it, somebody else will&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motlana says Nail was interested in buying a portion of Telkom, but<BR>was barred by Telkom's insistence that foreign companies must come, not<BR>in partnerships with local black companies in the name of black economic<BR>empowerment, but on their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He laments this, arguing no black company can provide &quot;international<BR>connectivity, foreign capital, better management and new technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With regard to the pyramid control of businesses in the Johannesburg<BR>Stock Exchange, he says it &quot;has been the standard structure in South<BR>Africa. Look at Murray and Roberts, Sancorp, Sanlam, Anglo American.<BR>Then when a young black company like Nail goes to the stock exchange,<BR>they say No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talk of flattening the pyramids, he says, is not fair to the emerging<BR>black business, &quot;there should first be a levelling of playing fields.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Nail's plans for 1996: &quot;We want to consolidate. We'd like to focus<BR>on telecommunications, obtain a TV licence, increase our stake in<BR>newspapers, and I won't tell you the rest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What people should be asking is, how did you get where you are. We<BR>can share ideas, form groups together and move forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Gerard Bhengu, forgotten KwaZulu-Natal artist, is now<BR>the subject of a retrospective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of my childhood memories is of attending an art exhibition at the<BR>Payne Bros store in Durban. The exhibitor was Tretchikoff -- the<BR>controversial, popular and very rich artist who held his road shows at<BR>the elegant art- deco store which housed a gallery. It was interesting,<BR>therefore, to learn that Gerard Bhengu was also one of the store's<BR>proteges. When one of Bhengu's other patrons, Phyllis Savory, considered<BR>producing a book on the artist's work, she stated that she wished it to<BR>be &quot;on the same lines as the Tretchikoff book that Mr Timmins produced a<BR>few years earlier&quot;. The book on Bhengu did appear, but, unlike his<BR>contemporary, Bhengu became neither a household name nor a millionaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While comparisons between the two artists are spurious, it is worth<BR>noting that both were popular and promoted by the same gallery, which<BR>operated with a commercial bias. However, the art market during the<BR>Fifties and Sixties was not geared towards the payment of high prices<BR>for works by black artists. Bhengu's first patron, Dr Max Kohler,<BR>encouraged him to sign his name as &quot;Bhenger&quot; in the hope that its<BR>Germanic sound would be more acceptable to a white art-buying public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The retrospective exhibition at the Tatham Gallery has been curated<BR>to bring these facts to the fore. Works are classified in sections to<BR>highlight patronage rather than style or subject matter -- an approach<BR>raising questions of influence, personal agendas and economic pressures.<BR>This curatorial method, while relatively unusual in a South African<BR>context, demonstrates a serious art-historical approach to the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bhengu was born in 1910 in the mission settlement of Centecow,<BR>attached to the Marianhill mission, in southern Natal. It was here that<BR>he encountered Kohler, who was an amateur ethnologist and commissioned<BR>Bhengu to produce illustrations for his ethnological texts. The<BR>discipline and accuracy necessary for this type of illustration suited<BR>Bhengu's talents and he produced detailed and meticulous images. These<BR>were contentious among his peers: attitudes towards ethnicity,<BR>nationhood and tribal identity were highly controversial, particularly<BR>following the Native Administration Bill of 1927, which made tribal<BR>chiefs the leaders of all black South Africans, and exerted control<BR>leading to the bantustans and apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was through his portrayal of ethnic types that Bhengu's art<BR>achieved its popularity, especially among the tourists who frequented<BR>the Payne Bros gallery. Seeing a number of his sepia portraits together<BR>makes it obvious that he perfected a slick technique which allowed mass<BR>production, although this doesn't detract from his ability as a<BR>draughtsman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As well as portraiture he depicted the rural countryside of his<BR>youth, but his view differed from the early white artists such as Thomas<BR>Baines, Jacob Hendrik Pierneef and Clement Senque, who showed the land<BR>as majestically devoid of humanity and waiting for the white settler.<BR>Bhengu's landscapes were peopled, showing the black person inhabiting<BR>and working the land. As discussed in the catalogue by Leeb du Toit and<BR>Zaver Dinos, these images could be seen to express ideas of rightful<BR>ownership and perpetuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to contemporary accounts, his freest and most creative work<BR>was that which no longer exists except through photographs, sketches and<BR>verbal descriptions. These were murals commissioned by the herbalist EG<BR>Tembe in 1959, and a mural for the Wesleyan Methodist Institute in<BR>Durban in 1942. They were both created for black audiences and the<BR>latter was said to be the earliest example of black protest art in South<BR>Africa. Both these murals have been destroyed, but written accounts seem<BR>to confirm that the fact of a different audience affected his work<BR>strongly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bhengu died, poverty stricken and unheralded, at the age of 80. This<BR>exhibition highlights his talent and the manner in which economic and<BR>educational pressures of his time influenced his art. It forms an<BR>important addition to South African art history, but unfortunately will<BR>only be viewed in KwaZulu- Natal. It deserves a wider audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The retrospective runs at the Tatham Gallery in Pietermaritzburg<BR>until January 7, and at Durban Art Gallery from January 28 to February<BR>26.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johanneburg - Not quite Montreux in July or April in Paris, Cape Town<BR>in February nonetheless promises a feast for lovers of jazz. Next month,<BR>Cape Town will play host to the largest jazz festival ever held in South<BR>Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The line-up includes some impressive artists: trumpeter Maynard<BR>Ferguson, Brazilian-born vocalist Tania Maria, guitarist Earl Klugh, and<BR>Don Grusin. The festival also brings back to South Africa singer Randy<BR>Crawford, while lovers of the big-band sound will be given the<BR>opportunity to hear the most famous of the biggies -- the Count Basie<BR>Orchestra.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After last year's debacle, when two Americans promoting a jazz<BR>festival in the mother city did a duck shortly before it was due to<BR>open, South Africans might well feel cynical. The prevailing air of<BR>scepticism has also meant that little has been written about the<BR>upcoming festival. But organisers Esther Miller and Gerry Spencer (who,<BR>it should be pointed out, had nothing to do with the earlier ill-fated<BR>event) have been working towards this for three years and insist that no<BR>one will be taken for a ride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two, both local jazz musicians, say intensive planning has gone<BR>into the festival, and that their approach differs significantly from<BR>that of last year's organisers. Firstly, Miller and Spencer say, no<BR>names were announced until artists' attendance had been confirmed.<BR>Secondly, sponsors were secured well in advance. The financial and<BR>logistical support of a major airline and financial institution has been<BR>secured, with American Express in charge of bookings and accommodation,<BR>and KLM acting as official carrier for the festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spencer and Miller hope the festival will bring in hard foreign<BR>currency in the form of tourism. The sponsors are putting together<BR>special tour packages, while Captour has promoted the event in overseas<BR>exhibitions. Apart from a lot of inquiries, there are no firm bookings<BR>by foreign tourists as yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, the festival will give Cape jazz a much-needed shot in the<BR>arm (a dose is also needed by Johannesburg) The festival will make use<BR>of a range of large venues, including the Good Hope Centre, the Nico<BR>complex, and the Waterfront Amphitheatre and Theatre; throughout the<BR>week, smaller gigs will also take place at various jazz clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jazz students will benefit from workshops and clinics -- two a day,<BR>throughout the week - -- some of which will be conducted by Klugh, who<BR>is a musical educator. The creation of a scholarship for young South<BR>African musicians to study overseas is also in the offing. There will be<BR>collaborations between local artists and visitors, and Miller herself<BR>will perform with the Jack Van Poll Trio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miller and Spencer say they tried to cater for classical as well as<BR>mainstream jazz-lovers by inviting Wynton Marsalis to play with the Cape<BR>Town Symphony Orchestra (CTSO). Unsuccessful negotiations over a fee and<BR>bad timing for the CTSO put paid to that. But South Africans may yet<BR>hear the flawless if sometimes passionless trumpet of Marsalis -- the<BR>organisers say they will try to bring him out either next year or the<BR>year after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hopefully the festival will be a success, because Capetonians can<BR>look forward to this becoming an annual event. Miller and Spencer have<BR>secured the sponsors' support for the next five years, and are<BR>negotiating to have the festival concerts televised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cape Town jazz festival runs from February 26 to March 3.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Shunned and blamed by their families for being persons of<BR>loose morals, pregnant unmarried women in Zimbabwe can now find solace<BR>in a church-based local centre that nurtures both mother and child and<BR>offers a stepping stone for a future with a purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwana Anokosha (local Shona language for &quot;precious child&quot;) Home is<BR>the only centre of its kind in Zimbabwe and possibly Southern Africa. It<BR>offers temporary sanctuary to unmarried women, mostly teenagers with<BR>unwanted pregnancies who have been rejected by their boyfriends and<BR>families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Situated in Westwood, on the outskirts of the capital, Harare, &quot;Mwana<BR>Anokosha&quot; was set up in 1988 by the Shelter Trust, which is made up of a<BR>group of clergymen. It now has a full-time social worker who counsels<BR>and &quot;rehabilitates&quot; the destitute young women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the women first come to the home, the social worker explained,<BR>most of them are so lonely, desperate and down-hearted that some have<BR>suicidal tendencies. A lot of time and effort is put into helping them<BR>overcome these feelings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to public criticism, many of the women wrote a joint<BR>letter to Harare's Herald newspaper last year and spoke frankly about<BR>their experiences. &quot;We have been kept in an atmosphere of trust and<BR>confidence where we may await the birth of our children in peaceful<BR>surroundings. After the delivery of our babies, when we have grown to<BR>love them, we are able to be reunited with our families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are very upset to discover that some people feel we are young<BR>people of loose morals. This is not true, and can be confirmed by the<BR>people who know us. Most of us really believed in the proposals of love;<BR>we did not even think of using contraceptives ...,&quot; they wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of illegitimate or one-parent children in Zimbabwe is<BR>high. Despite the difficulty in obtaining official statistics on this<BR>sensitive issue, it is believed that roughly one in every four teenage<BR>pregnancies is illegitimate. Several young women have been convicted and<BR>imprisoned for baby dumping over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 1000 women have been offered temporary shelter at the Mwana<BR>Anokosha Home until such time that they were reunited with their<BR>families. However, besides offering refuge to these rejected pregnant<BR>women, Shelter Trust has now opened up a skills training centre called<BR>Mufandichimuka Training Centre in Harare, designed to offer a new lease<BR>of life to these women, most of whom could not support themselves and<BR>their babies when they left home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The co-ordinator of Shelter Trust, Sister Theresa Mangieri, said the<BR>centre has been named &quot;Mufandichimuka&quot; meaning the home of the<BR>resurrected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When the girls come to us, they are always so desperate and without<BR>hope. But the moment they get skills they will then be able to live a<BR>new life. They are being resurrected hence the name Mufandichimuka,&quot; she<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The majority of the women who end up at Mwana Anokosha Home are those<BR>who dropped out of school before sitting for a public examination,<BR>either Grade Seven, Form One or 'O' Level and have no formal skills at<BR>all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out of the more than 280 who visited Shelter Trust offices in 1995,<BR>56 per cent dropped out of school before sitting for a public exam while<BR>eight per cent were illiterate. Those who had work experience had either<BR>worked as domestics or vendors. Only seven per cent had either done<BR>dressmaking, knitting, till operating or First Aid. There was one<BR>university graduate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sister Theresa told APS the number of under-age girls (13 to 17<BR>years) becoming pregnant was also on the increase. The majority of the<BR>abandoned women came from intact families, only 4 per cent came from<BR>single-parent families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In practice, Shelter Trust has been approached by women, some of<BR>whom might have tried backstreet abortions and failed. With support and<BR>counsel, these women have developed a strong bonding with their children<BR>after delivery. Unjust social conditions and priorities of the parents<BR>and boyfriends encourage them to choose an option they are not<BR>comfortable with. The psychological damage of abortion for a woman<BR>cannot be measured. Women who have contemplated abortion, but have not<BR>acted, have a sense of well-being and joy after delivery,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The majority of the men inolved with these women were single did not<BR>want any responsibilities. Casual sex was reported to be on the increase<BR>as the use of contraceptives, according to the women, was almost nonPlanning Council.<BR>existent, despite concerted campaigns by the Zimbabwe National Family</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In line with the needs of the marginalised single mothers we are<BR>going to start a day skills training. The centre is expected to be<BR>officially opened in January 1996 but a pilot project involving 100<BR>former clients was carried out from September 1995. We have sent out 500<BR>newsletters to former clients telling them about the centre and whether<BR>they will be interested and the response has been overwhelming. So far<BR>100 clients have said they would want to enrol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Firstly we are going to offer a course in home economics,<BR>housekeeping, knitting, sewing and cooking - and later we will introduce<BR>practical courses. We are starting off with the areas that are necessary<BR>to them now. We will later introduce such courses as hair braiding so<BR>that they can earn some income,&quot; she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from offering courses, the centre would, from time to time,<BR>invite public speakers on various topics including the Acquired Immune<BR>Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and maintenance to educate the mothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In general, the women in our residential outreach programmes are in<BR>need of means of a livelihood after they give birth and are discharged.<BR>Their common cry is for employment. Our hope is that when the skills are<BR>acquired, the women will be able to earn a living either on their own or<BR>through employment,&quot; noted Sr. Theresa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Researchers indicate that male reluctance to accept responsibility<BR>for pregnancy, coupled with limited psychological and financial support<BR>from the family are all seen as the crucial determinants in babyBank, the chances of women dying from pregnancy-related causes are<BR>dumping, infanticide and child abandonment. And, according to the World<BR>highest in Africa among all developing regions of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is largely due to the high population growth rate - now the<BR>world's highest at around 3.2 per cent a year - which is taking a severe<BR>toll on the health of the mothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, some 150,000 maternal deaths are recorded each year in<BR>Africa as a whole, a figure representing 30 per cent of all maternal<BR>deaths world-wide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - From time immemorial the enhancement of beauty has been a<BR>major preoccupation of the womenfolk. Not surprisingly, the beauty<BR>industry is among the ten largest industries in the world today.<BR>Unfortunately many products used in the pursuit of mostly &quot;better&quot;<BR>physical appearance have serious medical repercussions. This is true of<BR>skin bleaching creams, lotions, and soaps. In the Gambia, military ruler<BR>Captain Yahya Jameh has clamped down on skin lightening preparations,<BR>citing the medical dangers posed to the women in this West African<BR>country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On New Year's Eve, Gambian military ruler Captain Yahya Jameh decreed<BR>a complete ban on skin bleaching creams, lotions and soaps used as<BR>cosmetics by women in the Gambia. Captain Jameh said he had instituted<BR>the measure &quot;for the good of the Gambian woman&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But observers say the practice of bleaching the skin to obtain a<BR>lighter complexion is so widespread in Africa, banned items will simply<BR>be smuggled into the country. This is what has been happening in Nigeria<BR>for over 10 years now since skin bleaching products were officially<BR>banned in the mid-eighties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of the documentation of the dangers over the last 20 years,<BR>millions of women continue to bleach their skins to obtain a lighter<BR>skin. The best approach to the problem would thus include education, an<BR>option already adopted by the Medical Women's Association of Nigeria<BR>(Lagos Zone).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the main reasons cited by African women for lightening the<BR>skin, thus bleaching out the natural dark pigmentation that provides<BR>protection against the harsh rays of the sun - range from &quot;men like fair<BR>complexioned women&quot;, &quot;it is fashionable&quot; to &quot;purify the skin&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the last ten years, the Medical Women's Association of Nigeria<BR>has intensified its campaign efforts to make Nigerian women understand<BR>that the process of lightening the skin is very hazardous indeed. The<BR>association has produced a pamphlet, Bleaching the Skin - What Every<BR>Woman Should Know, in which Dr. Osinuppebi-Cole observes that<BR>paradoxically while black people were bleaching their skin to look more<BR>beautiful, whites were seeking to acquire a turn by exposing themselves<BR>foolishly to the sun. &quot;So while the blacks are seeking to become white,<BR>the whites are seeking to become dark, both exchanging good skin for<BR>cancerous skins&quot;, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 70s, skin bleaching creams containing as much as 7 per cent<BR>hydroquinone level - one of the main bleaching agents, were freely<BR>available in Africa. At the same time in America and Europe, creams<BR>containing one to two per cent level of hydroquinone were banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Osinupebi-Cole laments that there was keen competition among<BR>manufacturers of skin bleaching agents and women demanded ever stronger<BR>chemicals. &quot;The most serious damage to our women was done during this<BR>period,&quot; she argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today these soaps, creams and lotions originate in Asia, Europe,<BR>America and within Africa itself. One Irish woman Member of Parliament<BR>describes the trade in skin bleaching chemicals as &quot;a scandal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Yetunde-Olumide says the habit of bleaching the skin &quot;started in<BR>racially morbid countries like the United States and apartheid era South<BR>Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hydroquinone and mercury in soaps are the main bleaching agents.<BR>Because mercury is absorbed through the skin it eventually leads to the<BR>development of various complications, notably kidney related.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officially, mercury products were banned in Nigeria in the midas &quot;Drula bleaching wax&quot;, &quot;Skinguard&quot;, &quot;Tura&quot;, &quot;Concorde&quot;, &quot;Roberts&quot;,<BR>eighties but the same continue to flow into the country under such names<BR>&quot;Neko&quot;, &quot;Sukkisa&quot;, &quot;Bango&quot;, &quot;Jeribu&quot; and many more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Yetunde-Olumide says the hydroquinone compound not only causes<BR>damage to the superficial skin cells, but has serious effects on the<BR>underlying connective tissues beneath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hydroquinone causes an acid called &quot;homogentisic&quot; acid to be<BR>deposited in skin tissue, eventually damaging the elastic properties of<BR>the skin as well as the ability of the skin to recover from injuries<BR>like cuts or surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accordingly, long-term bleachers have serious complications when they<BR>go for surgery or even when they have minor cuts. &quot;Wounds from even<BR>minor cuts become very difficult to heal. For the surgeon, it is a<BR>nightmare trying to stitch back the skin of chronic bleachers&quot;, says<BR>Olumide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, by removing the natural pigmentation of the skin through<BR>bleaching, the African woman is also exposed more intensively to<BR>dangerous rays of the sun. She becomes more prone to cancer of the skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Olumide says at present there is no known cure for damage<BR>inflicted by skin bleaching. Having damaged their skin, some desperate<BR>women ask for a skin graft and feel terribly dejected when told that<BR>grafted skin cannot &quot;take&quot; because the entire associated structure had<BR>been damaged irretrievably.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - African countries have been urged to intensify efforts<BR>aimed at achieving sustainable development through adoption and<BR>implementation of sound environmental policies. But as it came out<BR>clearly at the Sixth Session of the African Ministerial Conference on<BR>the Environment (AMCEN) in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, last December,<BR>financial constraints are the root cause of the continent's<BR>environmental dilemma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the programme of action on the environment which gave birth<BR>to the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) was<BR>launched in Cairo, Egypt in December 1985, no deliberate programme was<BR>set up to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the continental<BR>organisation in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Sixth Session of AMCEN held in the Kenyan capital from<BR>December 11 to 15, 1995, proceedings were dominated by discussions about<BR>the survival of the organisation and the source of resources to run it<BR>rather than achievements made in the last one decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tone was set at the opening of the Expert Group Meeting which<BR>preceded the ministerial meeting when the representative and Director of<BR>the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Africa Regional Office<BR>Mrs. Maria da Graca de Amorim called on African countries to focus<BR>properly on the situation confronting the continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Amorim conceded that the African Ministerial Conference on the<BR>Environment had scored a number of inspiring successes such as the<BR>development and adoption of the African Common Perspectives on<BR>Biological Diversity and the significant inputs made by AMCEN to the<BR>process leading to the Regional Annex and resolution on urgent action<BR>for Africa with respect to desertification control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She however pointed out that the successful implementation of AMCEN<BR>programmes was being stifled by lack of financial resources and called<BR>for a discussion of modalities for fund mobilisation from member<BR>countries, bilateral and multilateral agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is an urgent need for AMCEN to streamline its programmes to be<BR>focussed more on sensitising African governments on sustainable<BR>development issues especially with regard to ratification and<BR>implementation of international conventions, and to back up these<BR>programmes with financial support,&quot; de Amorim said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She also called on the meeting to address the issue of formalising<BR>AMCEN by statutes as an intergovernmental body whose decision can be<BR>tabled at summit meetings of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and<BR>the establishment of appropriate institutional arrangements and linkages<BR>to make the conference secretariat more effective. Currently there is an<BR>amorphous secretariat comprising the UNEP, OAU and Economic Commission<BR>for Africa (ECA) personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Do we want AMCEN to function independently or to remain an<BR>organisation that is permanently asking for charity?&quot; That question<BR>posed later by the Senegalese Minister for Environment and Conservation<BR>of Natural Resources, Prof. Abdoulaye Battily reflected the mood of the<BR>ministerial meeting as participants considered the report of the group<BR>experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delegates expressed great concern about the unsatisfactory response<BR>by member countries to financial contributions towards trust fund agreed<BR>upon at the Fourth Session of AMCEN in 1991. Only Egypt and Seychelles<BR>had contributed US dollars 679,700 and 500 respectively towards the<BR>fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The initial idea of the trust fund was that contributions would<BR>accrue over a five-year period (1992-96) after which interest yield<BR>would be used for the operational activities of AMCEN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After lengthy debate on whether to make contributions to the Trust<BR>Fund mandatory or voluntary, the African ministers decided that an<BR>urgent appeal be sent to member states to contribute to the fund while<BR>examining the possibility of adopting new measures of raising additional<BR>resources in order to facilitate the implementation of AMCEN programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also noted with concern the declining funding to the UNEP<BR>Environment Fund and urged all member states to honour their pledges to<BR>the fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps the most significant decision was one to formalise the<BR>institutionalization of AMCEN as an intergovernmental organisation,<BR>providing the legislative framework including a constitution and related<BR>rules and regulations which will certainly cover financial<BR>contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also decided to continue with the 1994-95 programme of<BR>work into the biennium 1996-97 with some additional priorities. These<BR>would include sustainable industrial production, consumption and<BR>industrial development including aspects relating to the framework<BR>convention on change, environmentally sound management of all types of<BR>wastes including hazardous and potentially hazardous and toxic<BR>chemicals; as well as strengthening the African common perspective and<BR>position on the Convention of Biological Diversity through sensitization<BR>and awareness creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other priority areas identified included the rational management of<BR>African forests through the establishment of mechanisms for subto Combat Desertification and Drought.<BR>regional cooperation and support to the implementation of the Convention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the implications of major international events, the meeting agreed<BR>that AMCEN should fully participate in activities relating to<BR>environmental impacts within the framework of the UN agenda for peace<BR>and development and related programmes of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The major international events highlighted by the Group of Experts<BR>meeting included the World UN Summit for Social Development held in<BR>Copenhagen last year, the 1995 World Summit for Women held in Beijing,<BR>China and the World Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II)<BR>scheduled for Istanbul, Turkey in June 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AMCEN meeting also agreed that full support should be given to<BR>the assessment of environmental impacts of conflict and the resultant<BR>suffering by refugees and displaced persons as well as host nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The session outlined five main areas of orientation that would form<BR>the focus of activities in the next two years. These comprise the<BR>sensitization and organisation of workshops, seminars and conventions<BR>within the available financial resources; support for the drawing up of<BR>national environmental plans of action and national Agenda 21 plans; the<BR>integration of the environmental impact assessment in development<BR>projects; capacity building, environmental education and public<BR>awareness; and the strengthening of sub-regional cooperation in<BR>environmental management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the UN Under-Secretary General and Executive Director of UNEP,<BR>Miss Elizabeth Dowdeswell said during the opening of the ministerial<BR>meeting, AMCEN has a major role to play in reversing the continent's<BR>decline by judiciously using its vast resources, traditional solidarity<BR>and cooperation and international support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The time has come for African countries to take their future into<BR>their own hands and not to allow their economies to be micro-managed by<BR>the international donor community. It is also incumbent on the donor<BR>community to listen more to Africa and seek partnerships as between<BR>equals, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While commending AMCEN for its contribution towards Africa's gradual<BR>transition to sustainable development in collaboration with the OAU and<BR>the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and other relevant regional<BR>and sub-regional institutions, Dowdeswell urged the Environment<BR>Ministers to press their governments to fulfil their financial<BR>obligations to the AMCEN Trust Fund to enable the organisation implement<BR>its laudable programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his intervention, Prof. Battily had decried the presentation of<BR>lengthy speeches and rhetoric which did not address the real issues.<BR>&quot;Where do African countries expect to get Samaritans to cover the<BR>financial aspect of the fight against environmental degradation?&quot; he<BR>asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the speakers who came up with some novel ideas was Samuel<BR>Nyambi, the Director of the New York-based UN office to combat<BR>desertification. Nyambi, a Cameroonian, suggested that AMCEN be renamed<BR>the African Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development<BR>(AMCED) to catch up with the spirit of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de<BR>Janeiro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others also proposed that the conference be named the African<BR>Ministerial Conference on Sustainable Development (AMCOSD). Still,<BR>Nyambi argued that whatever name is finally retained, there was need for<BR>greater participation in the 1997 evaluation of the implementation of<BR>the Rio Conference Agenda 21 on sustainable development. &quot;We need to<BR>prepare adequately for that session as we did before the 1992 Earth<BR>Summit because the issues are so crucial to Africa,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of the last minute shift of venue from Harare, Zimbabwe, to<BR>the Kenyan capital, the 20-plus Environment Ministers, more than 100<BR>government representatives and experts from 45 African countries, as<BR>well as about 25 international organisations who attended the Sixth<BR>Session of AMCEN, had enough food for thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We believe there should be greater inter-African consultation to<BR>ensure that we in Africa understand ourselves better and speak with a<BR>common voice at global fora on the environment,&quot; noted Dr. Farouk<BR>Brimah, Ghana's Deputy Minister for Environment, Science and Technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organisations represented included among others, the Organisation of<BR>African Unity (OAU), International Labour Organisation (ILO) the World<BR>Bank, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Southern<BR>African Development Corporation (SADC), and the UN Food and Agricultural<BR>Organisation (FAO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Seventh Session of AMCEN will take place in Senegal in January<BR>1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - President Daniel arap Moi has banned a family life<BR>education manual compiled by the Scout/Girl Guide Movement in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Announcing the ban on &quot;Scouting Manual on Family Life Education in<BR>Africa&quot;, President Moi said on New Year's eve that the book contained<BR>foreign ideas and emphasised that not all things that have come to<BR>Africa are necessarily good for the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moi directed that the sales of the manual compiled as a collaborative<BR>effort with the Margaret Sanger Centre of Planned Parenthood in New<BR>York, USA, be stopped immediately.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move is seen as placatory to the the Catholic Church in Kenya<BR>which particularly over the last two years, has campaigned consistently<BR>against the intended introduction in schools of secular sex/family<BR>education lessons which the Church claims would disrupt the moral fabric<BR>of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Scouting Manual on &quot;Family Life Education for Africa&quot; has been<BR>available in Kenya over the last eight years, but it came into<BR>prominence last August when the head of the Catholic Church in Kenya,<BR>Maurice Cardinal Otunga, who is also the Archbishop of Nairobi, and the<BR>Imam of Jamia Mosque in Nairobi, Sheikh Ali Shee, jointly set alight a<BR>pile of sex education books, condoms and other birth control- related<BR>items in a public ceremony in the city's Uhuru Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the African regional director of the Scouts movement Mr.<BR>Kieraithe Nyagah told APS he was apprehensive the negative publicity<BR>associated with the manual would cast the Scout/Girl Guide Movement in<BR>bad light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Nyagah underscored that the manual had been produced &quot;with all<BR>the best intention in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As scouts we have a duty to ensure that young people have a chance<BR>and access to materials that enable them to develop into wholesome<BR>citizens,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some critics have charged that some of the illustrations in the<BR>manual were too explicit and indecent. Nyagah says these were intended<BR>to show the changes in a young person's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While conceding that input came from all over the world, he<BR>emphasised that the bulk of the manual had been produced with local<BR>African expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nyagah observed that no other country in Africa including the<BR>regional ocean nations, had banned the book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He observed, however, that like any other textbook that had been in<BR>use for sometime the manual was subject to review from time to time.<BR>&quot;Where it has hurt the sensitivities of any community or religious<BR>affiliations, we are prepared to modify it accordingly,&quot; emphasised the<BR>Africa regional boss of the Scout's movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the presidential directive to ban the manual has received<BR>widespread support among Catholic clergy and bishops. Praising President<BR>Moi for his decision, Cardinal Otunga promised that the Catholic Church<BR>in Kenya would re-dedicate itself to strengthening the family fabric.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banjul - Gambian junta leader Captain Yahya Jameh has announced that<BR>presidential and general elections will be held next June to restore<BR>normal constitutional democracy in this West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his New Year's message broadcast on the night of December 31,<BR>Jameh said that the voting will be preceded by local council polls in<BR>May and that the Commonwealth would back Gambia in the electoral<BR>process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three elections will be supervised by an independent commission<BR>recently set up by the military regime, which plans to return to<BR>barracks after 23 months in power, Jameh said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military ousted civilian president Sr. Dawda Jawara in a coup in<BR>July 1994, prompting international donors, led by former colonial power<BR>Britain, to condemn the coup and suspend financial assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jameh presented an optimistic account of the achievements of his<BR>regime, speaking of progress in education, transport, energy production<BR>and television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that tourists were flocking back after the &quot;disaster of<BR>1994&quot;. This year, Gambia expects to host some 70,000 tourists, as in<BR>1992 and 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Head of State also declared that Nigerian and Cuban doctors would<BR>take over from Chinese medical workers, who withdrew their cooperation<BR>after Gambia recognised Taiwan in July last year. Beijing considers<BR>Taiwan to be part of China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presidential announcement came only three days after Captain Sana<BR>Babally, former vice-president of the tiny West African state of Gambia<BR>was jailed for nine years by a court martial here, after being accused<BR>of having plotted against President Jameh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sabally was said to have headed two attempted coups -- the first in<BR>November 1994 and the second in January 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jameh, who is chairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling<BR>Council, seized power in a bloodless coup on July 22, 1994 after<BR>toppling Dawda Jawara, who is in exile in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sabally, the vice-chairman of the Council, was accused of having<BR>participated in the January 1995 plot involving a Captain Sadibu Hydara,<BR>former Interior Minister who has since died in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the military government is claiming more than US dollars<BR>11 million from Jawara for alleged fraud in an oil deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement published here on January 3, Jameh's government said<BR>it accepted the findings of a commission of inquiry into the deal set up<BR>in October 1994 under a Nigerian judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The inquiry dealt with financial transactions linked to the supply of<BR>17.3 million barrels of oil supplied by Nigeria as aid to Gambia between<BR>1984 and 1988.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blantyre - The Malawian government has filed an appeal in the Supreme<BR>Court against the acquittal of former president Hastings Kamuzu Banda<BR>and five others on murder charges, a verdict that was seen here as the<BR>most controversial since the country attained independence from British<BR>colonial rule more than 30 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecutions Director Kamudoni Nyasulu, who led the prosecution<BR>against Banda over the deaths of four politicians, said January 4 he was<BR>appealing on points of law, pointing out that the High Court judge's<BR>summing up in the trial exceeded the proper bounds of judicial comment<BR>and made it difficult for the jury to convict the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The judge misdirected the jury. All he was doing is to present my<BR>case and find faults in it,&quot; Nyasulu said of the acquittal on December<BR>23.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judge had told the seven-member jury that much of the<BR>prosecution's case during the five-month trial was speculative and<BR>circumstantial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda -- who ruled Malawi for 30 years before being ousted in<BR>elections in 1994 -- had been charged with conspiracy to murder along<BR>with his close aide John Tembo, constant companion Cecilia Kadzamira and<BR>three former police officers -- MacDonald Kalomba, Leston Kikaomba and<BR>MacWilliam Lunguzi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in his ruling, Judge Mackson Mkandawire found Banda, Tembo,<BR>Kadzamira, Kalomba and Leston not guilty of murder and also ruled that<BR>Kadzamira and Lunguzi were not guilty of conspiracy to obstruct the<BR>course of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury's decision, which took just two hours to reach despite five<BR>months of trial, and the final verdict split the country along political<BR>lines, with supporters of Banda's opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP)<BR>celebrating while many Malawians who have long been convinced of Banda's<BR>guilt were wondering how the jury arrived at its verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Minister Collins Chizumila said after the verdict: &quot;I haven't<BR>changed my mind that they are guilty. I don't know what went wrong. It's<BR>either incompetence or bribery. I've also heard the judge misdirected<BR>the jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judge had told the jury that most of the prosecution evidence was<BR>circumstantial and speculative. But the courtroom, packed with<BR>supporters of Banda's MCP, erupted with scenes of joy when the jury<BR>announced its verdicts and Tembo and the other accused leapt to their<BR>feet and gave the thumbs up sign, carrying shoulder high the senior<BR>British defence lawyer Clive Stanbrook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda, who once threatened to feed his opponents to the crocodiles<BR>during 30 years of untrammelled power in the tiny southern African<BR>nation, was tried in absentia because of ill-health and senility, and<BR>was at his house in Blantyre under Kadzamira's care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tembo, believed to have been the power behind Banda as the former<BR>dictator became increasingly frail in recent years, told the crowd<BR>outside the courtroom that the verdict was &quot;a reflection of the<BR>independence of the judiciary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charges stemmed from the deaths in 1983 of cabinet ministers Dick<BR>Matenje, Aaron Gadama, John Sangala and parliamentarian David Chiwanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was officially announced at the time that they had died in a car<BR>accident, but an inquiry after Banda's ouster found that they had been<BR>battered to death, placed in a car and pushed over a cliff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prosecution said the men had been murdered because they had<BR>become outspoken in their opposition to the misuse of government funds<BR>and were suspected of harbouring ambitions for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A commission of inquiry after Banda's ouster had, however also<BR>established that they had in fact been murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The families of the four murdered Malawian politicians have also<BR>vowed that they would continue pressing for justice despite the<BR>acquittal of Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will continue to seek damages and find out who ordered the<BR>killings even if it means dying myself to find the truth,&quot; said a<BR>spokeswoman for the families, Mary Gadama, daughter of Aaron Gadama, one<BR>of the four politicians murdered in 1983. Mary leads a group of<BR>relatives fighting for compensation and for the murderers to be brought<BR>to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;How do you free murderers like that? It means in Malawi anyone can<BR>kill a person and get away with it. Somebody must be guilty of ordering<BR>the murders,&quot; she asked after the verdict was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda took power in impoverished Malawi after independence from<BR>Britain in 1964 and soon established a vice-like grip on the country,<BR>introducing a one-party state and ruling the country as a personal<BR>kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was accused of widespread human rights abuses while remaining an<BR>ally of Western nations for his staunch anti-communist stance during the<BR>Cold War, receiving visiting British royalty in a red Rolls Royce<BR>convertible and entertaining them to lavish banquets in his Sanjika<BR>Palace outside Blantyre.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bujumbura - Fear has gripped Burundi as the country continues to<BR>slide into anarchy that threatens to lead to the eruption of the endemic<BR>ethnic bloodbath that has continued unabated in the two former Belgian<BR>colonies of Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundian politicians have expressed despair as they see their small<BR>central African nation sliding into anarchy, while gunmen call the shots<BR>at the risk of sparking ethnic bloodletting as savage as Rwanda's 1994<BR>genocidal war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we are not vigilant enough, our country runs the risk of total<BR>collapse,&quot; warned President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in his 1996 New<BR>Year message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The new year must be a year in which all these phenomena are swept<BR>away and defeated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The institutions, the numerous state services and organisations have<BR>the capacity to agree to work together to overcome these phenomena of<BR>fear, violence and uncertainty which threaten our people's future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;I personally promise to do everything to root out of the<BR>state apparatus all those who are obstructing the state from operating<BR>normally and those who may try to sabotage it from within. The security<BR>forces and the administration must understand that they have no other<BR>raison d'etre than the protection of the interests of our people, whose<BR>primary interest is the right to life. In this struggle, the people must<BR>not be regarded as an object which can be manipulated to achieve<BR>whatever goals you want to attain, but as a partner, indeed the cardinal<BR>one,&quot; said the Burundian Head of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government radio echoed that warning on January 4 with the report<BR>of yet another massacre, which left seven people dead and 20 wounded in<BR>an attack in a southwestern town by men, some in uniform --wielding<BR>assault rifles and machetes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ideology of exclusion and genocide&quot; is gaining ground and the<BR>economy is being destroyed, warned Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo in his<BR>own New Year message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In New York, United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali<BR>resuscitated a proposal he made in 1994 for a UN standby force to be<BR>deployed in neighbouring Zaire, and for guards to protect relief agency<BR>workers in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He warned of &quot;a real danger of the situation in Burundi degenerating<BR>to the point where it might explode into ethnic violence on a massive<BR>scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But analysts say members of the UN Security Council are unlikely to<BR>heed his call, made public on January 2 and the idea of UN troops here<BR>is fiercely opposed by the commanders of Burundi's own armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That raises the prospect of an unhindered civil war on the scale of<BR>that in neighbouring Rwanda, where Hutu extremists killed more than half<BR>a million men, women and children in 1994 before being defeated by an<BR>army of rebel Tutsi. UN troops there failed to halt the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, UN special rapporteur for human rights in<BR>Burundi lashed out last December at the international community, saying<BR>the passivity of the rest of the world was largely responsible for the<BR>fostering civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the clashes here between Hutus, who make up 85 per cent of<BR>the population of 5.5 million, and Tutsis, who comprise 14 per cent but<BR>dominate the armed forces, go unreported. Diplomats and relief workers<BR>put the death toll at around 30 a day -- 10,000 to 15,000 last year,<BR>according to the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF - Doctors<BR>without Borders.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of Hutus have fled to Zaire, and even Rwandan Tutsis who<BR>had lived in Bujumbura since they were children have fled the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eleven relief workers have been killed since August 1994, and a<BR>number of agencies, including the International Committee of the Red<BR>Cross (ICRC), the French-based International Action Against Famine, have<BR>recently suspended their operations or pulled out most of their<BR>expatriate staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Organisation of African Unity has discussed the probability of a<BR>UN-backed African force to keep the peace in Burundi, but the idea has<BR>been opposed by a number of influential countries in the region, such as<BR>Kenya, and appears to have made little progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government is a fragile coalition under Ntibantunganya, a 39one but their commanders, and politics are increasingly dominated by<BR>year- old Hutu, and Nduwayo, a Tutsi. But the armed forces answer to no<BR>extremists on both sides, observers say.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nouakchott - Mauritanian President Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya<BR>dismissed Prime Minister Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubakar on January 2 and<BR>immediately named Shaikh Alavia Oulod Mohamed Khouna to replace him,<BR>officials announced in the capital Nouakchott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new premier has been Minister for Fishing and Economy since<BR>February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A former Finance Minister, Boubacar had headed the government for<BR>four years and no reason was given for his sacking, although an informed<BR>source said his departure would pave way for &quot;a more politically solid<BR>team&quot; to prepare for elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mauritania's opposition has been calling for the dissolution of<BR>parliament since the first multiparty elections in 1992, which it<BR>boycotted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other demands, they want a new electoral code, an independent<BR>judiciary and an impartial administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And on January 3, Kouna announced his new government line-up,<BR>drafting in four new ministers and dismissing three others, a move<BR>political observers said suggested a continuation of Boubakar's liberal<BR>economic policies, which began four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the exception of the Rural Development and Environment<BR>portfolio, given to Sow Demba, all of the key ministries -- Interior,<BR>Defence and Foreign Affairs -- did not change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new premier was replaced in his previous post as Minister for<BR>Fisheries and Maritime Economy by Baba Ould Sidi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Entering the government for the first time were Kamara Ali Gueladio<BR>(Public Health and Social Affairs), Boidiel Ould Houmeid (Commerce,<BR>Handicrafts and Tourism) and Seniya mint Sidi Haiba (Secretary of State<BR>for Women's Affairs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three sacked ministers were Sgnoire Ould M'Barack (Public Health<BR>and Social Affairs Minister), Timera Boubou (Rural Development and<BR>Environment) and Mariem mint Ahmed Aiche (Women's Affairs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shakeup comes just two days before a national convention of the<BR>ruling Democratic and Socialist Republican Party (PRDS), which will be<BR>centred on key decisions related to upcoming legislative and<BR>presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reliable sources here said late December that general elections<BR>planned for February and March 1997 could be brought forward to the<BR>fourth quarter of 1996, but there was no official confirmation of the<BR>report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local newspapers said parliamentarians of the governing party had<BR>been told of the possibility by Boubakar at a meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cairo - Armed Muslim militants killed two Coptic Christian<BR>agricultural workers and dumped their bodies on a nearby railway track<BR>where they were crushed by a train in southern Egypt, police said here<BR>on January 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fundamentalists from the same group, the Jamaa Islamiyya, killed a<BR>third person and wounded five in an attack the same day in the same<BR>region of southern Egypt, a hotbed of extremists battling to overthrow<BR>the government of President Hosni Mubarak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attacks took place in Minya province near the town of Mallawi,<BR>300 kilometres south of the capital, Cairo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the first attack at the village of Al-Idara, militants shot dead<BR>Jamil Saad Said and Issa Yussef Georgi, whose crushed bodies were found<BR>on railway tracks by villagers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police said the militants had killed the two farm workers because<BR>they suspected them of passing information to the security services<BR>about extremists hiding in nearby sugar cane fields</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the second attack, a municipal guard was killed and three of his<BR>colleagues as well as two civilians were injured when Jamaa Islamiyya<BR>activists opened fire on them in the village of Gelba near Mallawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 29, Islamic militants shot and critically wounded a<BR>doctor for raping a Muslim girl in a revenge attack on his clinic which<BR>left a Christian male nurse dead, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A group of gunmen broke into Dr. Boutros Maxwell Boutros's clinic in<BR>Fikriya village, Minya province, and sprayed the clinic with bullets,<BR>critically injuring Boutros and killing Christian nurse Makram Subhi<BR>Said, 45, before escaping, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police said Boutros had previously received threats from armed<BR>extremists after he raped a 17-year-old Muslim girl from nearby<BR>Gemaliyya village, the hometown of a local militant leader, Farid Salim<BR>Kerdani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The girl's family had agreed not to seek revenge against Boutros in<BR>exchange for a monetary sum, a common practice in southern Egypt, where<BR>violent clan feuds are frequent and &quot;crimes of honour&quot; are often solved<BR>far from the courts. But armed Muslim fundamentalists from the town had<BR>vowed to avenge the girl's rape, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A day earlier, Muslim militants had also killed a tractor driver as<BR>he cleared sugar cane from a field in southern Egypt for police hunting<BR>fugitive extremists, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police had ordered a group of tractor drivers on January 4 to clear<BR>away parts of the cane field near Mahras village outside Mallawi town,<BR>after receiving reports that militants were hiding there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two extremists opened fire on the tractor drivers as they worked,<BR>killing Shahata Abdel Aziz Mohammed, 30. Police said officers returned<BR>fire but the two gunmen escaped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Militants frequently use the high-growing sugar cane fields in<BR>southern Egypt as cover for ambushes and hideouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest deaths bring to 938 the number of people who have been<BR>killed since March 1992, when Muslim militants began a violent campaign<BR>to bring down Mubarak's government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Leaders of Uganda's Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches<BR>have warned against intrigue, bribery and violence during this East<BR>African country's first election in over a decade early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If any evil people come to you with evil money, dismiss them like<BR>how Jesus did with Satan,&quot; the Archbishop of the Anglican Church of<BR>Uganda Livingstone Mpalanyi Nkoyoyo said in a stern warning against<BR>bribery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The concern by the church leaders comes as both opposition candidates<BR>and those royal to the ruling Uganda National Resistance Movement liven<BR>up to Presidential and parliamentary elections expected to begin in<BR>March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his New Year address the Head of Uganda's Catholics, Cardinal<BR>Emmanuel Wamala noted with concern &quot;the serious disagreement&quot; on<BR>Uganda's new constitution which he says may lead some people to go to<BR>&quot;the bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even (President) Museveni does not agree with some parts of the<BR>constitution like myself ... we should bury our differences and build a<BR>united Uganda,&quot; Cardinal Wamala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ugandan Constitution which was promulgated last November<BR>entrenches and extends Museveni's nine-year old no-party system for<BR>another five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ousted Ugandan President Dr. Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress<BR>(UPC) and the opposition Democratic Party (DP) which have formed an<BR>Alliance under DP. leader Paul Semogerere say a constitution which<BR>imposes severe restrictions on political parties virtually banning them<BR>during the elections is &quot;mockery of democracy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is like two men competing in a 100-metre race. One of them starts<BR>50 metres away a head of the other,&quot; Paul Semogerere told APS in a<BR>recent interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Museveni however dismissed the Opposition which have<BR>received sympathy from Western donors particularly the United States as<BR>&quot;Foreign Parrots&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although the basic underlined principles of democracy are Universal,<BR>the forms which democracies take must vary from one country to the other<BR>... parroting forms from elsewhere is a disservice to the development of<BR>democracy in our society,&quot; Museveni said in his New Year address to<BR>Ugandans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile President Yoweri Museveni has commended the people of<BR>Nyabubushozi county, Mbarara district, 270 kilometers south west of<BR>Kampala for embracing the &quot;gospel of development&quot;.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged the church to get actively involved in programmes geared to<BR>motivate the people to work and improve household incomes in the social,<BR>political and economic sectors in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The service was delivered by George Birungi who also reported on<BR>steps being taken by the church to encourage income generating<BR>activities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>...United Nations - The Security Council today condemned in the<BR>strongest terms those responsible for the daily killings, massacres,<BR>torture and arbitrary detention in Burundi and said they must cease<BR>immediately. In a statement read by its President, Sir John Weston<BR>(United Kingdom), the Council encouraged all States to take measures<BR>necessary to prevent such persons from travelling abroad and receiving<BR>any kind of support. It shared the deep concern of Secretary-General<BR>Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the situation in the country and called on all<BR>concerned in Burundi to exercise maximum restraint and to refrain from<BR>all acts of violence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council reiterated that all those who committed or authorized the<BR>commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law were<BR>individually responsible and should be held accountable. It stressed the<BR>importance of the International Commission of Inquiry. The Council also<BR>reiterated its profound concern about radio stations which incited<BR>hatred and acts of genocide and encouraged Member States and others to<BR>cooperate in their identification and dismantling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Expressing grave concern at recent attacks on international<BR>humanitarian personnel, the Council said such actions had led to the<BR>suspension of essential assistance to refugees and displaced persons and<BR>the temporary withdrawal of personnel. It underlined that the Government<BR>of Burundi was responsible for the security of international personnel,<BR>refugees and displaced persons there and called on it to provide<BR>security for food convoys and the humanitarian workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council welcomed the Secretary-General's decision to ask the<BR>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata to<BR>discuss with Burundi officials, steps which might be taken to defuse the<BR>situation and said it would consider his proposal for a deployment of<BR>guards in light of Mrs. Ogata's mission and reports reaching him from<BR>the field. It asked him to consider what role UN personnel in the region<BR>and other support personnel might play in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stressing the importance of continued attention by the international<BR>community as a whole to the situation, the Council encouraged Member<BR>States to intensify contacts and visits. It reaffirmed its support for<BR>the Convention of Government of 10 September 1994 -- the institutional<BR>framework for national reconciliation -- and again called on all<BR>parties, military forces and elements of civil society to fully respect<BR>and implement it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - The political climate in Washington will likely<BR>remain extremely difficult for Africa advocacy this year. Funding for<BR>aid, peacekeeping and other U.S. international obligations is sure to<BR>come under renewed attack in the second year of the 104th Congress. Many<BR>congressional advocates for African issues, Republican and Democratic,<BR>are scheduled to retire at the end of the 1996 session, notably Senators<BR>Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Paul Simon (D-Ill.). And it is very<BR>unlikely that international issues, much less Africa, will figure<BR>prominently in the 1996 election campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In general, therefore--short of a catastrophe on the scale of the<BR>Rwandan genocide in 1994 or Somalia's disintegration in 1992-1993--it<BR>will not be easy to attract high-level attention to African issues, even<BR>when they do not involve significant funding commitments. The one<BR>African issue that seems likely to stay in the spotlight is the campaign<BR>for sanctions to promote democracy in Nigeria--if, that is, the latemaintained.<BR>1995 momentum of grassroots involvement and media coverage is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, the prospects are good for maintaining some level of<BR>constructive U.S. involvement in strengthening ongoing ties with South<BR>Africa. Washington will also likely play a role in selected peacekeeping<BR>operations such as Angola and Liberia, in promoting debt relief for<BR>African countries, and in a number of aid initiatives. The extent of<BR>active U.S. support for pro-democracy and human rights efforts in<BR>Nigeria and other countries, going beyond business-as-usual diplomacy,<BR>will depend above all on the level of public pressure and press<BR>attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economies Grow, But So Does Debt Burden</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economic growth rates for Africa in 1995 and 1996 were projected to<BR>be in the 3% range, considerably higher than the 1.5% average of the<BR>early 1990s. But this still falls short of the rate necessary to keep<BR>pace with population growth, much less provide a basis for sustainable<BR>growth. Reductions in flows of external assistance, together with a<BR>still-mounting debt burden, pose additional obstacles. However, rising<BR>capital flows into South Africa and expectations of increased growth<BR>there and in several other countries somewhat offset these general<BR>trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A late 1995 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and<BR>Development highlighted prospects for foreign investment in Africa,<BR>which it termed potentially the most profitable world region. But longprograms mean most of the continent's people face a grim year of renewed<BR>term economic difficulties and new burdens imposed by economic austerity<BR>hardships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proposals for further action on debt reduction, including the more<BR>than $35 billion Africa owes to international financial institutions,<BR>will be under consideration in 1996. Congress may also try to shape an<BR>agenda for improving Africa's trade prospects. But both initiatives will<BR>have to overcome apathy as well as substantive opposition to new<BR>proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prospects for economic advance also depend fundamentally on<BR>resolving and averting violent conflicts and on building and<BR>strengthening democratic institutions. In terms of security, the most<BR>intractable and devastating conflict in 1996, as in 1995, is likely to<BR>be the war in southern Sudan. But implementation of peace settlements in<BR>Angola and Liberia was still problematic as the year began, and<BR>escalation of mass violence in Rwanda, Burundi or both was an everin Nigeria is likely to be the most prominent African issue in 1996.<BR>present danger. The struggle for democracy against the military regime<BR>Meanwhile, human rights activists and pro-democracy groups also face<BR>serious repression in a number of other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Countries and Issues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following are brief highlights of specific areas and issues on which<BR>U.S. involvement may make a difference this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conflict (Sudan and other countries): War continues in southern<BR>Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are caught in conflict<BR>between the brutally repressive Sudanese government and the Sudan<BR>People's Liberation Army, which has gained military ground in recent<BR>months. The international community is engaged in relief efforts, but<BR>efforts at mediation have stalled. Regime opponents in the north as well<BR>as the south have called for increased international pressure against<BR>the Khartoum regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While on a smaller scale than in Sudan, ongoing or sporadic violent<BR>conflict or insecurity characterizes a number of other countries,<BR>including Algeria, Sierra Leone, Zaire, Somalia, the Tuareg area in<BR>northern Niger, and KwaZulu/Natal province in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace agreements (Angola and Liberia): Observers are hopeful that<BR>implementation of the peace agreements in these two countries will move<BR>ahead in 1996, but further delays are almost certain and renewed<BR>conflict a constant threat. In Angola, the demobilization of Unita<BR>troops called for under the November 1994 accords has barely begun, and<BR>government forces are highly suspicious that the delay will be used to<BR>rebuild Unita military capacity. And in Liberia it is still doubtful<BR>whether the resources and political will are sufficient for the agreed<BR>disarmament of combatants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prevention of wider conflict (Rwanda and Burundi): The situation in<BR>these two countries continues tense and potentially explosive. Some 1.8<BR>million Rwandan refugees remain outside Rwanda, mainly in Zaire, where<BR>officials of the former Rwandan government responsible for the 1994<BR>genocide still hold sway over their army and most civilians. Delays in<BR>prosecutions for the genocide, and threats that the refugees might<BR>return or be returned home forcibly, are among factors making a new<BR>escalation of violence possible. In Burundi, ethnic violence will likely<BR>continue--and possibly escalate-- despite international mediators'<BR>efforts to maintain a delicate coalition between the predominantly Tutsi<BR>military and an elected multiethnic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democratization (Nigeria and other countries): The campaign for<BR>democracy in Nigeria gained new international prominence in late 1995<BR>after the Nigerian military regime executed enviromental activist Ken<BR>Saro-Wiwa and eight of his colleagues. Nigeria was suspended from the<BR>Commonwealth, and support for oil and other sanctions came from a wide<BR>range of groups around the world. Bills were introduced in the U.S.<BR>Congress which fell short of oil sanctions, but did include bans on new<BR>investment and a freeze on personal assets of top Nigerian officials.<BR>Governments were slow to move on more substantive measures, which were<BR>vigorously opposed by oil companies. The sanctions campaign will likely<BR>continue to grow in 1996, but it remains to be seen whether it can<BR>overcome excuses for inaction by governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, in many other countries, notably Zaire and Kenya, the prothe face of both repression and other ploys by incumbent regimes. In<BR>democracy momentum of the early 1990s has been difficult to maintain in<BR>some countries that have recently held elections (for example, Ethiopia,<BR>Cote d'Ivoire), serious questions have been raised about the fairness of<BR>those polls. International donors, including the United States, have<BR>shown far more consistency in pressing for free-market economic policies<BR>than they have in demanding respect for human rights and political<BR>participation by diverse social groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa and the continent: In 1996 South Africa is likely to<BR>confront increasing disagreements among labor, business and different<BR>political forces over how to craft social and economic policies that<BR>address the legacy of apartheid inequality. The Truth Commission, headed<BR>by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, will begin its controversial work of<BR>investigating human rights abuses in the apartheid era. Conflict between<BR>the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party may escalate<BR>in KwaZulu-Natal, particularly around the local government elections now<BR>scheduled for May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, South Africa will be forced to deal with the challenge of<BR>identifying appropriate roles for itself on wider African issues, such<BR>as Nigeria. In doing so it must avoid the twin dangers of narrow<BR>isolationism and condescending paternalism toward other African states.<BR>Like the U.S. outside the continent, South Africa neither can nor should<BR>attempt to resolve every crisis. Its stance on key issues, regardless,<BR>will be closely watched by African countries and outside powers alike.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York. - Text of Letter from William A. Orme, Jr., Executive<BR>Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, to Nigerian Head-ofThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to strongly protest<BR>State General Sani Abacha.<BR>the December 23 arrest of Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of the Lagosindependent weekly magazine.<BR>based Tell magazine, and to condemn the recent series of attacks on the</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Igiebor, recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in<BR>1993, was arrested by six members of the State Security Service (SSS) at<BR>his home in Lagos. He was then transported to SSS Headquarters in<BR>Shangisha. Authorities continue to hold Igiebor in solitary confinement<BR>without charge, and are demanding that he reveal his sources for<BR>articles criticizing the military government. During interrogations,<BR>Igiebor has repeatedly stated that he receives no financial support<BR>outsiders or Nigerian citizens, and that any information he receives<BR>arrives by mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the same date of Igiebor's arrest, SSS agents confiscated 20,000<BR>copies of Tell magazine's Christmas Day edition. The week before, on<BR>December 16, 1995, 55,000 copies of Tell were seized from Academy Press,<BR>the magazine's printing house. Earlier this week, on January 1, Nigerian<BR>security agents unsuccessfully attempted to seize this week's issue of<BR>Tell, and subsequently resorted to seizing the publication from Lagos<BR>vendors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Igiebor's arrest followed the December 23 raid of the home of Tell's<BR>managing editor, Onome Osifo-Whiskey, and the December 15 detention by<BR>Lagos police of Adedisi Dejo, Emmanuel Piper, Yeni Oldwolabi and Iyi<BR>Isaac, also reporters of Tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ has also documented the December 15 arson of The Guardian; the<BR>December 16 siege of AM News; the December 19 police assault and<BR>detention of four photojournalists, Peter Obe, Segun Olakitan of Tell,<BR>Abiodun Ajala of This Day, and Bayo Ewuoso of AM News; and the December<BR>20 arrest of Lagos vendor Olabisi Akintoye for possession of<BR>&quot;unpatriotic magazines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, we note with alarm the New Year's eve bombing of the<BR>office of the Independent Communications Network-publishers of the The<BR>News, Tempo, and Tempofootball-which destroyed millions of naira worth<BR>of property, but thankfully caused no fatalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ welcomes news of the release of Fred Eno, senior aide to Chief<BR>Moshood Abiola; Wariebe Agamene, president of the Nigerian Oil and Gas<BR>Senior Workers Union; Amos Idalemo, also a union official; and Sylvester<BR>Odion Akhaine of the Campaign for Democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, CPJ strongly urges you to immediately and unconditionally<BR>release Nosa Igiebor and to launch an independent investigation of the<BR>aforementioned attacks on the independent press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York. - Text of Letter from William A. Orme, Jr., Executive<BR>Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, to President Konan<BR>Bedie of Cote D Ivoire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee to Protect Journalists writes to strongly protest the<BR>arrest of Freedom Neruda, deputy editor of the independent opposition<BR>daily, La Voie, and to condemn the sentencing of his two colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neruda was arrested on January 2, 1996 and held for questioning. The<BR>next day, he was taken to an Abidjan correctional institution and<BR>charged with insulting the head of state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neruda was out of town when his colleagues, Abou Drahamane Sangare,<BR>director of publications of the Nouvel Horizon group which owns La Voie,<BR>and La Voie journalist Kore Emmanuel, were summoned by police on<BR>December 21. Upon his return on January 2, Neruda presented himself to<BR>authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His charge stems from the December 18 La Voie article which suggested<BR>that Your Excellency brought bad luck to the Ivorian soccer team ASEC by<BR>attending the December 16 African Champions Cup final, which the favored<BR>ASEC lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates. On December 28, publisher<BR>Sangare and reporter Emmanuel were each sentenced to two years in prison<BR>for &quot;offending the chief of state,&quot; and fined three million CFA<BR>(US$6,000). La Voie was also banned for three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of our<BR>colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ believes Freedom Neruda and his<BR>colleagues have been unjustifiably imprisoned, due solely to exercising<BR>their right to free expression. This right is guaranteed by Article 19<BR>of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19<BR>of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article<BR>9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, all to which, we<BR>respectfully remind Your Excellency, Cote d'Ivoire is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ strongly urges Your Excellency to immediately and unconditionally<BR>release Neruda. Moreover, we call for the reversal of the convictions of<BR>Sangare and Emmanuel, and their immediate release from prison. In light<BR>of Your Excellency's recent reelection to the Presidency, CPJ trusts<BR>that you will do your utmost to cease harassment of the independent<BR>press, and to ensure that journalists in Cote d'Ivoire may work free<BR>from intimidation and harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before his arrest on 2 January, Neruda's colleagues, Abou Drahamane<BR>Sangare, director of publications of the Nouvel Horizon group which owns<BR>La Voie, and La Voie journalist Kore Emmanuel, were also each sentenced<BR>on 28 December to two years in prison for &quot;offending the chief of<BR>state,&quot; and fined three million CFA (US$6,000).  La Voie was also banned<BR>for three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their charges stem from the 18 December La Voie article which<BR>suggested that Your Excellency brought bad luck to the Ivorian soccer<BR>team ASEC by attending the 16 December African Champions Cup final,<BR>which the favored ASEC lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ contends that the sentences handed down against Neruda, Sangare<BR>and Emmanuel are excessive and unjustified.  Having previously written<BR>to Your Excellency on 4 January regarding this matter, we strengthen our<BR>call for the nullification of their convictions, and their immediate and<BR>unconditional release.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - The head of the Church of Uganda Archbishop Livingstone<BR>Nkoyoyo has announced sweeping changes in the church in a move to curb<BR>what he called &quot;corruption and inefficiency in the church top circles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The changes range from forced retirement of some of the Bishops whose<BR>terms have expired to forced transfer of some members of the laity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those bishops who have refused transfer should either quit or accept<BR>transfer,&quot; Archbishop Nkoyoyo said on January 8 in his first major<BR>statement published in Kampala since he came to office last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a pastoral letter entitled The Anglican Church of Uganda policy of<BR>work and guidelines, Nkoyoyo says the changes are meant to address<BR>&quot;factors that have caused conflicts in the church leading to some<BR>followers quitting for emerging sects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Archbishop said; &quot;Some church leaders aim at only amassing wealth<BR>I will have no mercy on them.&quot; Although the Archbishop neither said when<BR>he would effect the changes nor named the leaders in question his<BR>remarks were generally understood to be reaction to the ongoing row in<BR>the eastern church of Uganda Busoga diocese, the biggest controversy in<BR>the church so far.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - A directive by Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi that a<BR>Muslim teachers' training college be registered has brought to an<BR>amicable end a wrangle between the country's Muslims and the Ministry of<BR>Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presidential order on January 9 came following a meeting between<BR>the Head of State and a delegation comprising prominent scholars of<BR>Islam, Imams and Members of Parliament at Moi's Harambee House office<BR>here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country's Muslim community, at loggerheads with Education<BR>Minister Mr. Joseph Kamotho over the registration of the shs. 20 million<BR>(US dollars 400,000) Mombasa (coast region)-based Islamic Teachers<BR>College in Mikindani area, had been warned by the ministry against<BR>establishing any academic programme. The Muslim community had earlier on<BR>expressed intentions to train 104 Islamic teachers annually.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM) had<BR>threatened to sue the government alleging religious discrimination while<BR>some zealots of the unregistered Islamic Party of Kenya (IPK) had<BR>declared a fatwa (death sentence) on Education Minister Joseph Kamotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUPKEM's argument was based on the fact that of the six private<BR>teacher training colleges in the country, five are run by Christian<BR>churches. They insisted that Muslims should also have their own colleges<BR>and charged that there is a serious shortage of trained muslims to teach<BR>Islamic Religious Education (RE) in schools. Most students are thus<BR>forced to opt for Christian Religious Education (CRE) which is more<BR>developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Education Director Mr. Ezra Njoka had dismissed the problem as<BR>statistical. &quot;We have enough teachers and we do not have the capacity to<BR>absorb them all. We are just not registering any more colleges,&quot; he had<BR>said before Moi's intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegation to the President's office last week was led by SUPKEM<BR>chairman, Prof. Al-Busaidy, who thanked the President on behalf of<BR>Kenya's Muslims and said there was no pre-condition for the Ministry of<BR>Education to employ graduates from the new college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ministry of Education plans to convert some of the 20 teachers<BR>training colleges it runs into secondary schools and polytechnics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Teachers remain some of the least paid Kenyan workers and often have<BR>their salaries delayed. Many Muslims however believe the government had<BR>blocked registration of the colleges - one at Mikindani, Coast Province,<BR>the other in Murang'a in Central Province - because it fears a<BR>connection with the IPK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since its founding in 1991, the IPK has campaigned against what it<BR>claims to be official neglect and marginalisation of Kenyan Muslims who<BR>comprise about 10 per cent of the national population of 25 million<BR>people. Muslims, although spread out all over the country are mainly<BR>concentrated in the coastal region and northern parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the whole, Christian-Muslim relations in Kenya have been peaceful<BR>but increasing suspicion seems to be rising between the two religious<BR>groups with the latter feeling the former are favoured by the State.<BR>President Moi is a Christian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslims have consequently cultivated a high media profile by<BR>sponsoring several programmes a week especially on the national radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Christians have steered clear of the present controversy,<BR>there is no telling where the suspicion may end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, by the time of going to press various reactions had been<BR>registered regarding President Moi's directive on the Muslim college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leaders and the unregistered IPK were of the opinion that<BR>Moi's move was merely a political ploy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mombasa Mayor Ahmed Mwidani, in whose region the teacher's training<BR>institution is situated, supported the registration of the college<BR>saying the Head of State was concerned about the welfare of Muslims in<BR>the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By January 10, students were reported arriving for enrolment for the<BR>1996 academic year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accra - Two major opposition parties in Ghana have called on<BR>President Jerry Rawlings to resign following accusations by Vicemeeting last month.<BR>President Kow Arkaah that Rawlings assaulted him during a cabinet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peter Ala Adjetey and Alhaji Asuma Banda, respectively leaders of the<BR>New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the Peoples Convention Party (PCP) told a<BR>press conference on January 4 that the behaviour of the president, in<BR>full view of the December 28 cabinet meeting, was unprecedented in the<BR>history of Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arkaah alleged that Rawlings kicked him in the groin, injured his<BR>left eye and tore his jacket in reaction to allegations of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arkaah, 68, said the violence had broken out after the president, 48,<BR>had walked into the meeting and accused his Vice-President of stating<BR>that corrupt practices went on during the regular cabinet sessions.<BR>&quot;Before one could say anything, he gave me a terrible blow on the<BR>shoulder which sent me falling,&quot; the police document said, quoting the<BR>vice president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I fell on my back. He began to pull me up but I would not allow him,<BR>so he tore up the shoulders of my jacket in the process. He then gave me<BR>a series of kicks in the groin,&quot; Arkaah said, adding that he never<BR>attempted to hit back &quot;due to my respect for (Rawlings) as the President<BR>of the Republic of Ghana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But reading from a prepared statement, Adjetey said &quot;the gravity of<BR>the act required that the president, in the interest of the dignity and<BR>honour of the Republic, resign his high office now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incident was &quot;not only unacceptable, but unpardonable in our<BR>social and cultural code of behaviour,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rawlings' resignation is &quot;the only way by which the dispute into<BR>which the presidency has fallen can be repaired,&quot; he said, urging<BR>Ghana's parliament to initiate impeachment proceedings against Rawlings<BR>should he fail to heed the resignation call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The issue calls for a national, not partisan response as the matter<BR>goes to the very survival of the institutions of the Fourth Republic,&quot;<BR>it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Members of Parliament should not forget that this is an election<BR>year and (if they do not act) they would be left with the task of<BR>explaining to their constituencies why they could not take this action<BR>to restore the dignity of the nation,&quot; said Adjetey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rawlings' National Democratic Conference currently holds 188 of the<BR>200 seats in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 29, the cabinet confirmed that Rawlings confronted Arkaah<BR>on December 28 in reaction to allegations made by the vice-president<BR>that corrupt practices took place during ministers' meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cabinet statement also suggested that unless Arkaah could<BR>substantiate his allegations, his presence on the cabinet would be<BR>problematic, but Arkaah has since said he would not resign over the<BR>issue, because Rawlings has no power under the constitution to sack his<BR>vice-president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in his first reaction on January 8, Rawlings launched a scathing<BR>attack on Arkaah and asked: &quot;How can a man who has formed an alliance<BR>with our opposition parties continue to be the vice-president of this<BR>government? He insists he can still sit in at cabinet meetings because<BR>the constitution says so, unless he tends to subvert the government from<BR>within.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his address during the third anniversary celebrations, Rawlings<BR>said the allegations of assault had soured the atmosphere for the<BR>Ghanaian government, its friends and potential investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the parade, watched by more than 15,000 people including<BR>diplomats, Arkaah sat passively beside his wife, Marian, and Rawlings<BR>and his wife, Nana Konadu, during the three-hour ceremony, during which<BR>the president took a military salute from 120 officers and 3,100<BR>soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arkaah, who had not been expected to attend, was greeted with cheers<BR>when his arrival was announced. Tension between the two men, who won<BR>elections on a joint ticket in 1992, has been common knowledge since<BR>early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In May, Arkaah called on Rawlings to rescind a controversial valueA spokesman for the opposition Alliance For Change (AFC) said that<BR>added tax, which sparked a wave of social discontent.<BR>Rawlings' behaviour was sufficient to merit his impeachment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Rawlings is a disgrace to Ghana. How can a president behave this<BR>way?&quot; he said. Rawlings has ruled this West African state since coming<BR>to power in a coup in June 1979.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sao Tome - A national government of unity has taken over in Sao Tome<BR>and Principe after being appointed by President Miguel Trovoada to<BR>tackle the economic and social ills facing this former Portuguese<BR>territory off the coast of West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 12-member team headed by Prime Minister Vaz d'Almeida took over<BR>on January 5 but was not expected to endure much beyond presidential<BR>elections scheduled for March 3, only a month before Trovoada's mandate<BR>expires in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new government includes six members of the former Movement for<BR>the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP/PSD), which holds the<BR>majority in parliament and four ministers from the Independent<BR>Democratic Alliance (ADI) which backs Trovoada. One other minister is<BR>from the Democratic Opposition Coalition (CODO), which is not<BR>represented in parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main opposition Democratic Convergence Party (PCD) which came to<BR>power in the years after the country abandoned single-party rule in<BR>1990, refused to join the national unity administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> D'Almeida on January 6 asked for a &quot;grace period of 45 days to carry<BR>through some urgent measures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he would seek to &quot;bring a new momentum to the administration<BR>to help the state restore its credibility&quot; after the military coup which<BR>briefly unseated Trovoada last August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He vowed to be &quot;rigorous and firm and to tackle the indiscipline and<BR>breakdown in law and order affecting the country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his New Year message to the nation, Trovoada set March 3 as<BR>the date for presidential elections in the small Atlantic archipelago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trovoada also expressed satisfaction at the outcome of inter-party<BR>discussions aimed at forming a government of national unity and<BR>thereafter named Vaz d'Almeida prime minister in place of Carlos da<BR>Graca.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vaz d'Almeida was deputy prime minister in Da Graca's outgoing<BR>government and is also deputy secretary general of the MLSTP/PSD<BR>liberation movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sao Tome and Principe, situated off the West African coast, gained<BR>independence from Portugal in 1975.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Scientists have dug up theories about human behaviour and<BR>have rightly postulated about what can make persons become ingenious to<BR>achieve a predetermined goal. The democratic governance and the market<BR>economic system are the panacea which unshackles man from the bondage of<BR>dependance and indolence to the freedoms of choice, creativity,<BR>resourcefulness and ingenuity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last four years of practicing democratic governance and market<BR>economic system have vindicated this postulate. The moment the economy<BR>was deregulated and all impediments to trade both local and foreign<BR>removed, the once seemingly unwitting populace and docile citizenry<BR>simply jettisoned and reverberated into the commercial activity totally<BR>unprecedented in the history of the nation. Under the stimuli of hunger<BR>and poverty, the most aggressive among the citizenry sauntered into the<BR>world and brought into this country anything conceivable from the<BR>mundane to the most sophisticated to the benefit of all. In the<BR>euphoria, however, confusion has reigned.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The elements that have been caught on the left and napping in all of<BR>this ecstasy are the authorities. From empirical evidence and so far as<BR>things are happening, it is evident that the governmental regulatory<BR>bodies were and are still not prepared and have lamentably failed to<BR>cope with the dictates of the performance of the market economic system.<BR>The market economic system, while priding itself on the ability to<BR>provide goods and services in abundance and efficiently, more often than<BR>not is wrought with vices and unbecoming trade practices which can<BR>wreak havoc in the economy. Fair competition is healthy but unfair<BR>competition is not. Unfair competition utilises resources inefficiently<BR>and erodes profit margins which are essential to the growth of any<BR>business enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Players in the market are not capable of regulating themselves for<BR>optimum operations. This is where different governmental bodies dealing<BR>with commerce and trade come in to establish rules and regulations to<BR>ensure that unfair practices are eliminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What should be borne in mind is the fact that the market economy<BR>calls for greater responsibility on the part of both government and the<BR>players in the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government acts as the referee and for as long as the referee<BR>plays the part efficiently and effectively, the players in the market<BR>will respond accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As of now, these regulatory bodies in government are dormant and<BR>starting soon, this article will begin analysing them one by one to show<BR>what they should do in order to help build a vibrant commercial practice<BR>in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A 50-year-old traditional potter has called on Zambians<BR>to develop an interest in art if they are expected to help preserve<BR>culture in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malita Chanda, who has more than 40 years experience in traditional<BR>clay pot making, said this in an interview on Wednesday at a Visual Arts<BR>Council (VAC) women's art workshop.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said there was a need to learn simple traditional works such as<BR>clay pot making to help preserve our ailing cultural background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Tufwile ukusambilila ukub-umba ifya pala inongo ne fingi ifyaibela<BR>nga tu li no kusunga intambi shesu (We must try to learn activities like<BR>the moulding of clay pots and many other traditional works if we are to<BR>help preserve our culture),&quot; Chanda said in a local lunguage, Bemba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chanda, who is also a leading marriage counsellor in Lusaka, had been<BR>invited to teach women artists participating in the VAC women's art<BR>workshop skills in traditional pottery which she learnt while in her<BR>village in Kasama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop, which ends today, was organised to facilitate the<BR>exchange of ideas of women in the field of arts and attracted 22 women<BR>participants drawn from all provinces in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same function veteran woman artist and VAC national treasurer,<BR>Agness Yombwe, on Wednesday revealed that the workshop concentrated on<BR>the exploitation of found materials (scrap material) which were<BR>inexpensive and readily available for use by the artist. It was funded<BR>by the European Union/CICIBA at a cost of K3.1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop will be closed tomorrow by community development<BR>permanent secretary, Hellen Matanda with an exhibition of the artworks<BR>prepared during the 10-day duration of the workshop.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A finance ministry financial expert yesterday said Zambia's<BR>per capita income will grow by 6 per cent per year starting this year,<BR>following its move from the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) to<BR>Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The expert, Hendrick Van der Heijden, disclosed this during a State<BR>House-organised press briefing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heijden, however, said the growth heavily depended on how swift the<BR>government moves in privatising Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The current price of copper at the world market is $1.10 per pound<BR>and if Zambia increases to export well, the economy should be expected<BR>to be on track with our forecast,&quot; Heijden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said with the availability of other exports at the export board of<BR>Zambia, no problem should be perceived in maintaining the growth rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You will be surprised to find how much there is to export at the<BR>export board, flowers and other products, while if you visit the tobacco<BR>farmers, you will find them smiling because they are doing good business<BR>abroad,&quot; Heijden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's graduation from SAP to ESAF is according to Heijden the<BR>largest contributor to the expected economic boom as it allows Zambia to<BR>borrow at concessional rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a press release by the World Bank shortly after Consultative<BR>Group meeting last December in Bournemouth said Zambia's external aid<BR>partners emphasised the vital link between good governance, economic<BR>growth, and improving the welfare of the Zambian people. The donors also<BR>registered concern on governance issues. In response, the Zambian<BR>government delegation reaffirmed its determination to continue on the<BR>path towards irreversible democratic change, including constitutional<BR>changes based on consensus. It also reiterated its strong commitment to<BR>free and fair elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the government has continued to oppose and resist proposals by<BR>the opposition and civic organisations to adopt the constitution through<BR>a constituent assembly, insisting the parliament they dominate is the<BR>only legally empowered institution to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everybody in Zambia is represented in parliament, and besides, only<BR>parliament can enact a Constitution while a constituent assembly can<BR>only vet some clauses,&quot; President Chiluba's public relations and press<BR>aide Richard Sakala reiterated the government's position at a press<BR>briefing at State House yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - THE government finally succumbed to opposition pressure<BR>yesterday and extended the voters registration exercise by another month<BR>effective today. But MMD national secretary, health minister Michael<BR>Sata, has advised that extensions will not be upheld forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We can not keep on extending deadlines. What happens if again people<BR>don't register?&quot; Sata asked in an interview yesterday. &quot;Such extensions<BR>could derail our democracy because whatever register will be in place at<BR>the time of the deadline must be used.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And announcing the extension in Lusaka yesterday Electoral Commission<BR>chairman Justice Weston Muzyamba said the Elections Office needed K2<BR>billion to pay the officers running the exercise.  &quot;I have been<BR>informed by the Director of Elections that K1billion is needed for the<BR>work done so far and another K1billion for the period that has been<BR>extended, &quot; Muzyamba said. &quot;We have to raise this money as soon as<BR>possible because without it, this extension will be meaningless, the<BR>registration officers need to be paid.&quot; The exercise will run until<BR>February 9.  Muzyamba, however, warned that the public should make<BR>good use of the extension because there might &quot;not be another after<BR>this one&quot;. And Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) has hailed the<BR>government's decision to extend the registration exercise saying it was<BR>a &quot;healthy sign&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's very important to note that the government can at least adhere<BR>to people's demands because it would not have really augured well had<BR>they ignored people's calls,&quot; FODEP secretary Bishop John Mambo said in<BR>an interview yesterday.  Last week opposition parties piled pressure<BR>on the government urging it to extend the registration period. Mambo has<BR>also said &quot;in the future, the commission must be made totally,<BR>independent so that decisions like those of extending should not await<BR>the government approval.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the commission should be independent enough to look at all<BR>disputes arising from the elections in order to make the whole<BR>democratising process more meaningful.  President Frederick Chiluba<BR>almost missed the deadline for the exercise in Ndola yesterday when he<BR>was among the last people registering on the scheduled final day of the<BR>exercise.</SPAN></P>

LuSE general manager Charles Mate said in an interview on<BR>Monday that a lot of work had been done so far towards achieving that<BR>goal and what remained was &quot;tidying up the loose ends which are too<BR>numerous to mention&quot;.  ZCCM released a prospectus in February last year<BR>in which it stated that it would like to float 35,470,620 of its &quot;B&quot;<BR>shares on the exchange but to date they have not. And these account for<BR>39.7 per cent of ZCCM's total shares.  Anglo American Corporation,<BR>through its subsidiary company Zambia Copper Industries (ZCI) Holdings<BR>Limited, owns 27.3 per cent of these &quot;B&quot; shares while the rest are held<BR>by various sections of the public.  The government owns the remainder<BR>of the 60.3 per cent of ZCCM shares, classified as &quot;A&quot; shares.  Stock<BR>exchange analysts say the delay in listing the &quot;B&quot; shares was due to<BR>disagreements between ZCCM and LuSE about how the floatation should be<BR>done.  Last month discussions between the LuSE and ZCCM intensified and<BR>now there is speculation that the two have agreed on a date for the<BR>listing, but Mate denies this. &quot;We are working on it, but we have not<BR>finalised it. I can't give a date because I have not got one,&quot; Mate said<BR>on Monday.  He added that he was reluctant to give further details<BR>because any &quot;careless and uncalculated statements could have global<BR>repercussions on stock markets&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ZCCM insists all has been done on<BR>its part, and what remains is for LuSE to sort out.&quot;We applied for the<BR>listing so it is up to them to comment on the matter,&quot; public relations<BR>manager Francis Musonda said in an interview on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some analysts have questioned the wisdom of listing the ZCCM &quot;B&quot;<BR>shares on the exchange given that the company is experiencing declining<BR>production and if the government sticks to its plans, it will not be<BR>until next year before the mines are privatised.  Theo Bull, a member<BR>of the Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industries (ZACCI)<BR>said in an interview on Saturday that it would be unwise to invest in<BR>the shares before fundamental issues like privatisation were addressed.<BR>In addition he said floating the &quot;B&quot; shares would not have much impact<BR>on ZCCM because the more important &quot;A&quot; shares would still be in<BR>government control.  Stock brokers, like Finance Securities' Nduba<BR>Namoonde, say the listing of ZCCM shares was welcome and it would make<BR>the LuSE the second largest capitalised exchange in the region after<BR>the Johannesburg exchange and would lead to increased business on the<BR>exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namoonde said the prospects for the company were getting better<BR>especially that the government has indicated that it would like to<BR>recapitalise the mines with the involvement of Anglo American<BR>Corporation. He added that investing in ZCCM when the company is not<BR>doing very well at the moment means that people will buy the shares<BR>cheaply but would be able to sell them at a profit when the company's<BR>fortunes change.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) yesterday<BR>called on the government to seriously consider de-linking the Electoral<BR>Commission from government to enhance democracy.  FODEP's call comes<BR>barely a week after opposition parties called for the resignation of<BR>chairman of the Electoral Commission Justice Weston Muzyamba for<BR>abdicating his constitutional and legal responsibilities to the<BR>government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FODEP alluded to this view saying even matters of extension of the<BR>registration exercise are being referred to cabinet by the commission.<BR>&quot;Only cabinet can decide making the commission totally toothless,&quot;<BR>carped FODEP secretary Bishop John Mambo.  Mambo accused members of the<BR>ruling MMD of having a &quot;short memory&quot; because they had agreed during the<BR>Cathedral meeting in 1991 that the Elections Office would be autonomous.<BR>&quot;We agreed that whoever comes into power and forms government, the first<BR>step was to de-link the Elections Office from government,&quot; Mambo said.<BR>&quot;But it seems people have short memories.&quot; FODEP said that the<BR>commission has to be seen to be independent and this is paramount as<BR>people are identifying it with the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president Alfred<BR>Zulu said extension of the voters registration will not make any<BR>difference to the apathy that has rocked the month long exercise. He<BR>instead suggested the issue should be first taken to parliament to amend<BR>the act which he described as outdated.  &quot;The government should amend<BR>all acts, rules and regulations that impede initiative in the<BR>registration of voters,&quot; Zulu said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Two American public lawyers have praised the preamble and<BR>provisions of the 1991 Zambian constitution on press freedom and freedom<BR>of speech which they say echoes similar sentiments in the American<BR>constitution.  But they have advised Zambians to debate openly if such<BR>provisions are to become a reality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am speaking as an outsider but<BR>I see natural rights of the individual in the words in the preamble like<BR>inherent, inviolable,&quot; said US lawyer David Putter.  Speaking at the<BR>United States Information Service (USIS) centre yesterday in a<BR>discussion organised jointly by the centre and the Law Association of<BR>Zambia, Paul Berch and Putter pointed to some 1991 provisions which they<BR>said were similar to those in the American constitution.  &quot;It is the<BR>principles and analyses of the American constitution which we can apply<BR>to the Zambian constitution. There may be parallels,&quot; Berch advised.<BR>&quot;The preamble to the 1991 constitution recognised the relationship<BR>between the people and the government.&quot; Putter added: &quot;The language of<BR>the 1991 constitution recognises the individual person as the source of<BR>power.&quot; According to Putter the 1991 Zambian constitution &quot;makes a<BR>strong statement which you will find in the American constitution&quot; on<BR>press freedom and speech.  &quot;Where government is based on the individual<BR>the scale of justice is tilted in favour of the individual and<BR>government has to justify its actions,&quot; Putter said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Eleven cities will go to the starting blocks in the<BR>race to host the 2004 Olympic Games, it was revealed in Lausanne on<BR>Wednesday. That was the deadline set by the International Olympic<BR>Committee (IOC) for the filing of candidatures at its headquarters in<BR>Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until Wednesday it was like trying to predict the outcome of a race<BR>without knowing who the runners would be but the contestants are now<BR>clear-cut in the bid to secure the IOC's nomination in September 1997.<BR>Besides Cape Town the other cities are: Athens, Buenos Aires, Istanbul,<BR>Lille, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, San Juan (Puerto Rico), Seville, St<BR>Petersburg and Stockholm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there had been much speculation about a Chinese bid, either<BR>from Beijing, who lost out narrowly to Sydney in the bid for the 2000<BR>Olympics, or Shanghai, they declined to file, much to the relief of<BR>South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether the mandarins in the politburo were too disheartened with the<BR>unfathomable workings of the IOC after losing with what they had<BR>incorrectly considered a winning ticket, or they were simply making way<BR>for their &quot;comrades&quot; in Africa, remains to be seen. But with China out<BR>of the way South Africa should have sole sway over the emotional and<BR>political votes. And, provided this country can deliver a competent<BR>technical bid, those votes should be enough to see the Games come to<BR>Africa for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Ball, chief executive officer of the Cape Town 2004 Olympic<BR>Bid, was upbeat about Cape Town's chances, but he warned against<BR>complacency. &quot;I believe every single candidate must be taken seriously.<BR>There are still 21 months of this process to go and a lot can still<BR>happen. There have been surprises in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For example, in the contest for the Winter Olympics when Lillehammer<BR>won it was not the favourite. Therefore one should never discount one's<BR>competitors, &quot; said Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obviously it is prudent to avoid counting your chickens before<BR>they've hatched for past experience has shown that the only certainty is<BR>that there are no sure-fire favourites where the members of the world's<BR>most exclusive club are concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For historical reasons Athens was considered to be a foregone<BR>conclusion to host the Centennial Olympic Games this year but lost out<BR>to Atlanta through what many believe was the Coca-Cola factor. Also,<BR>1988 hosts Seoul were considered no match for Nagoya and Mexico City was<BR>thought to be the least likely of the four candidates for the 1968<BR>Olympics because of its altitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has much going for it in terms of &quot;the missing ring&quot;<BR>factor which refers to Africa (represented by the black ring among the<BR>five Olympic rings) never having hosted the Games, together with the<BR>enormous amount of goodwill that exists towards this country at the<BR>moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are also issues which will favour some of the other cities.<BR>South America has never hosted the Games, which could favour Buenos<BR>Aires or Rio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa should be able to count on Africa's 19 members among the<BR>IOC's full complement of 106 but with Istanbul bidding for the second<BR>time, six of Africa's 19 votes could join an Islamic block if talk of<BR>block voting is to be believed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rome can be expected to mount a strong challenge with the powerful,<BR>although not necessarily popular, athletics supremo, Primo Nebiolo,<BR>leading the hunt for votes - something he has proved rather adept at<BR>when ensuring his own position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Rome has hosted the Games before, as has Stockholm. The Swedish<BR>capital will pose a threat with its superb array of infrastructure<BR>already in place together with a proven record of efficiency and a<BR>national environmental policy without equal. But providing South Africa<BR>does its homework properly it is difficult to see it losing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our responsibility is to make sure that we submit a very<BR>professional technical plan. We must not rely on emotion. We must<BR>compete and be professional and that's what we intend to do,&quot; said Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want our technical bid to be as competent as anybody's and I hope<BR>that we will then be able to persuade people not only that Cape Town is<BR>the best place to have the Olympic Games in 2004, but also that there is<BR>validity in the concept that an Olympics in Southern Africa can make a<BR>major impact on the socio- economic and socio-political future of this<BR>part of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Socio-economic impact is perhaps the greatest worry for most South<BR>Africans, particularly the residents of the Western Cape. Many people<BR>believe that the Games will prove to be an economic extravaganza the<BR>country can ill afford and that the taxpayer and ratepayers will end up<BR>footing any deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ball and his committee are well aware of such perceptions. &quot;We are<BR>starting a proactive approach in Cape Town which will be extended<BR>nationally to give more details of the real facts, our capability and<BR>the excitement of the bid. Until now we've tended to keep our heads down<BR>and deal with the preparation of the physical product. That was a policy<BR>decision. We felt that we couldn't go ahead and make a noise until we<BR>were satisfied we were on absolutely firm ground. We are now quite sure<BR>that we are on firm ground,&quot; said Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What the South African public is going to want reassurance about is<BR>the cost of the bid, but if the preliminary operating budget is accurate<BR>there is no need for alarm. It is predicted that the total revenue for<BR>the Games from television rights, sponsorships and ticket sales will be<BR>R4,21-billion which will produce a net surplus of R94 million after the<BR>Games are over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These revenues have made allowance for R504- million to go towards<BR>the provision of facilities in a total capital expenditure budget of<BR>R1,761-billion of which only R978- million will come from central<BR>government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These funds from government are required to upgrade the road and rail<BR>system in Cape Town and would have to be spent at some time in the<BR>future anyway. The government is therefore only being asked to bring its<BR>funding forward to assist with the staging of the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This means a shifting in the priorities of some of the government's<BR>transport budget but in terms of the benefits of staging the Games it<BR>will be more than worthwhile. The bottom line for the ratepayers of Cape<BR>Town is that the Games will not cost them anything and they will be left<BR>with an excellent set of sporting facilities and a much improved<BR>transport infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course this scenario relies on the assumption that Ball and his<BR>team have got their sums right. But with R2,5-billion in television<BR>rights already guaranteed (more than was budgeted for) from NBC's<BR>television deal with the IOC late last year and a well tested IOC<BR>marketing programme, much of the revenue is assured irrespective of<BR>where the Games are held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trick is going to be in keeping the cost of sports facilities to<BR>a minimum while still meeting the requirements of the International<BR>Sports Federations. Cape Town's operating budget is lower than Atlanta's<BR>(R5,69-billion) but higher than Sydney's (R3,46-billion at the time of<BR>bidding). Such figures can be misleading though because they do not<BR>always include the same things and the viability of Cape Town's figures<BR>will only really be put to the test when they are reviewed by the IOC's<BR>Evaluation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 23 the bidding cities will be briefed by the IOC in<BR>Lausanne on the electoral procedure. They will then have to finalise<BR>their bid books containing the technical details covering 19 different<BR>themes relating to the staging of the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These must be submitted to the IOC by August 15 and then towards the<BR>end of September the Evaluation Commission will begin its inspection<BR>visits to the candidate cities. The commission will present a report to<BR>the IOC next February and four of the 11 cities will be nominated as<BR>finalists for the bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These four cities will then be allowed to canvass the members of the<BR>IOC and the host city will be selected in a secret ballot at the IOC<BR>session in Lausanne on September 5 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ball and many others believe the Games are an economic opportunity<BR>South Africa simply cannot afford to miss. Certainly the staging of the<BR>Games provided a major boost to the economies of Japan and Korea which<BR>went on to become major world players. But by the same token Mexico also<BR>held the Games and has remained very much a Third-World economy. Only<BR>time will tell which route South Africa will take?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - There is a time for reappraisal and reassessment in<BR>every sphere of diverse activity the universe has thankfully thrown our<BR>way. Such must surely be the case in the light of the truly heroic klap<BR>Hansie Cronje and his side gave the Poms over three glorious days of<BR>Cape sunshine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And equally gratifying to finally break this country's one-day duck<BR>after four abortive attempts against England in a stirring victory at<BR>the same venue just five days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Right now, despite concerns about the brittle quality of the top<BR>order, there is the no doubt sage advice to the effect of the &quot;if it<BR>ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; variety being applied. This unquestioning<BR>philosophy has some merit, but there are some areas which can be<BR>addressed immediately before it all gets broke faster than anyone can<BR>fix it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first is surely the question of a back-up wicketkeeper at<BR>national level. This is a priority both for the incumbent, Dave<BR>Richardson, and the future of the national team. Richardson has played<BR>every test since this country's readmission from the years of selfdistinction. He has borne an unenviable task with equanimity and taken<BR>imposed darkness and, it must be added, played every one with<BR>the pressures which have so often been thrust unwillingly on him low<BR>down the order with dignity and calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it also cannot be denied that at 36 he is getting very close to<BR>his sell-by date. It is time, perhaps, to use the lateral thinking that<BR>has so often been lacking in all this country's sporting endeavours to<BR>this particular problem which is fast closing in on the selectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have had any number of pretenders to Richardson's crown. Erroll<BR>Stewart has come and gone. Steve Palframan has come and gone and then<BR>come again. Gerhardus Liebenberg was offered a brief flirtation, and<BR>youngsters like Nick Pothas and Paul Kirsten are waiting in the<BR>provincial wings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palframan is the heir apparent as the incumbent South Africa &quot;A&quot; among the 20 named for the initial World Cup squad. One must question<BR>such an exercise in alphabetic semantics this name for a team - and<BR>his ability close to the stumps against a spinner like Paul Adams<BR>though. Adams is going to be around for a while. The man behind the<BR>stumps will have to grow with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And why, too, did Palframan not do exactly what Richardson did when<BR>Adams had him floundering and ask the teenage wrist spin wonder to<BR>explain what he was doing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richardson's perception of the Adams wiles improved dramatically<BR>after an on-pitch conflab at Newlands. For the reserve side against<BR>England at Kimberley, Palframan never quite seemed to get the hang of<BR>it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liebenberg, one feels, will never wear the wicketkeeping gloves with<BR>any real panache, although there can be little doubt that he has a fine<BR>future as a batsman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pothas is rapidly improving behind the stumps under the tutelage of<BR>Ray Jennings at Transvaal and has a maiden ton against the English to<BR>show that his batting is coming on in leaps and bounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kirsten has all the pedigree and the competitive nature of his<BR>pedigree and one feels that he will one day take the step that the<BR>Kirsten family seem to regard as a natural progression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But none of them look really ready to step in if Richardson decides<BR>to call it a day ... and yet there is an answer if the selectors look<BR>past the obvious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rudi Steyn has all the credentials even if it is a while since he has<BR>stood behind the stumps. He kept wicket with some distinction for South<BR>African Universities and has also been considered good enough to open<BR>the batting for this country. He also has the advantage of nine years on<BR>Richardson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steyn is, in perhaps a different light, the type of multi-discipline<BR>player coach Bob Woolmer is on record as saying he is looking for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The multi-discipline approach has already thrown up Shaun Pollock,<BR>Jacques Kallis and - if you include his batting heroics with Dave<BR>Richardson in the 73-run last wicket stand which ultimately was a major<BR>factor in winning the test and series at Newlands - Paul Adams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Adams, several volumes have already been written about a man who<BR>has yet to reach his 19th birthday and play a hat-trick of test matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are still some patently raw patches about him which a career<BR>slated to be a long one will surely iron out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unique strangulated action and a control far beyond his years are<BR>always going to give opposition batters problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Adams, who has already learnt to disguise his grip, needs to<BR>concentrate on the speed of his run-up for the arm ball he bowls so<BR>well. His pace quickens perceptibly up to the wicket and makes it easy<BR>to pick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The youngster also needs to learn that the simplest way to get the<BR>ball to loop up to the bat is to deliver from half a yard (it is after<BR>all an imperial game) short of the crease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These fairly simplistic things he will learn. He is too good a player<BR>to ignore them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pollock, too, has been a revelation. He has a superb action and the<BR>fire to take the batsman on physically which makes a great fast bowler.<BR>Surely, this cannot be argued after his five- wicket haul at Newlands.<BR>Or his four for 34 in the opening one-day encounter against England at<BR>the same venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grafted onto this is a growing confidence in his undoubted ability<BR>with the bat shown in the stand at Kingsmead with Allan Donald and the<BR>sparkling 66 off a like number of balls in the 50-overs match at<BR>Newlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kallis, while he does not have the pace of a Pollock or a Donald or<BR>indeed the frustrating guile of Adams, is a more than useful medium<BR>pacer and will only grow in this department as his test experience is<BR>rounded out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there remains one point to consider. The pressure on Kallis with<BR>the bat is far more intense than the pressure on the Cape 20-year- old<BR>with the ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And one senses that while Pollock and Adams have been allowed to play<BR>their natural games, Kallis has operated under the severe restrictions<BR>of a preconceived game plan and his place in the batting line-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It returns us to the use of lateral thinking. Kallis is naturally<BR>aggressive with the bat and equally at home in the troublesome No 3<BR>spot. Against England in the decider in Cape Town he was neither. And<BR>this with Hansie Cronje battling to find anything approaching the form<BR>he is capable of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talent, it is true, will come through eventually, but placing<BR>shackles on it either slows the growth or stunts it altogether. Giving<BR>Kallis a freer rein while impressing him with his responsibilities at<BR>the crease could have been one solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moving him up an order which has stuttered and started at the top end<BR>is another.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa opens the 20th African Nations Cup finals<BR>on Saturday with a tough clash against Cameroon at the FNB Stadium in<BR>Johannesburg, and in the Group of Death - the other teams are Egypt and<BR>Angola -- every point will be vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the recent problems the Federation of Cameroon Football<BR>(Fecafoot) has had with Fifa over the government's interference with the<BR>election of Fecafoot members - coupled with the bad result on the field<BR>-- Cameroon come here as underdogs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it must not be forgotten that six years ago Cameroon stunned the<BR>world when they beat two-time world champions Argentina in the opening<BR>match of the World Cup in Italy. Cameroon sank Argentina with a firstfinal whistle to record a historic victory.<BR>half goal, and doggedly -- with nine men -- they defended until the</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rated as the &quot;no hopers&quot; in Italy, the west African country got the<BR>result that was to give African teams the respect they deserve on the<BR>international stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African champions in 1984 and 1988, and quarter-finalists in 1990 in<BR>Italy, the players of the Indomitable Lions will more than likely be<BR>able to withstand the pressure of the occasion on Saturday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To use the words of one soccer official, 10 seconds before the game<BR>the South African players would have sweated three times more than their<BR>opponents. The simple reason is that Bafana Bafana have never played<BR>such an important match since their arrival back in the international<BR>arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But much has also changed since South Africa first took those first<BR>tentative steps back onto the international stage. South Africa can<BR>boast a run of seven unbeaten games this year and include in their lineWilliams and Philemon &quot;Chippa&quot; Masinga of Leeds United.<BR>up of seasoned strikers the likes of Wolverhampton Wanderers' Mark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However both remain doubtful starters. Masinga will only arrive on<BR>Friday as Leeds played a cup game on Wednesday and Williams sustained an<BR>ankle injury doing duty for his team last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National coach Clive Barker seemed undisturbed, saying: &quot;I am sure<BR>everyone will be fit for Saturday.&quot; Williams may be fit but Masinga<BR>playing after 10 hours on the plane would be asking too much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Previously players and officials have used jet-lag as an excuse for<BR>bad performances, but with so much to play for one hopes that there will<BR>be no silly excuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neil Tovey, the South African captain affectionately known as<BR>&quot;mkhukhu&quot;, will have to marshal his defence against the likes of<BR>Francois Omam Biyick, Augustine Simo, Alphonse Tchami who now wears the<BR>famous number nine Roger Milla jersey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameroon coach Jules Nyongha will pin his hopes on the dazzling<BR>midfielder Roger Feutumba to exploit any South African weaknesses.<BR>Feutumba played for Mamelodi Sundowns for most of this year so he has<BR>experience of local conditions and players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With injury doubts about their forwards South Africa go into this<BR>game without too many attacking options and Daniel Mudau, who came in as<BR>a late replacement for Sean Dundee, is also suffering from an ankle<BR>injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shaun Bartlett, who made his debut for South Africa in the recent<BR>Simba Four Nations Cup, will have to test his abilities against the big,<BR>strong Cameroon defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One thing that still baffles me is why the enterprising Umtata Bucks<BR>striker Brendon Augustine was left out. He last wore South African<BR>colours when he scored an equaliser against Mozambique in a friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Comforting news is that Barker said he would call on him should the<BR>worst come to the worst. The winger Helman Mkhelele should be a constant<BR>menace down the line if he is played.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their financial problems aside, Cameroon are sure to give South<BR>Africa and their supporters a run for their money. The two teams have<BR>met four times, sharing the spoils twice, with South Africa winning one<BR>and Cameroon taking the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tournament is played in a round robin system, with three points<BR>for a win. The top two teams in each group will go through to the<BR>quarter-finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At this knockout stage, in the event of a draw after full time, 30<BR>minutes extra time will be played followed by a penalty shootout if the<BR>two teams are still even.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> @ Morning Glory rises to the occasion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAILING: Jonathan Spencer Jones</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CAPE TOWN put on her finest with an almost windless morning giving<BR>way to a fresh 20-knot south-easterly for the start of the Rothmans Cape<BR>to Rio on Saturday, and hundreds of well-wishers lining the seashore and<BR>on craft from jet skis to ocean-going tugs turned out to cheer the fleet<BR>on its way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the 46 entrants -- eight of the smaller yachts having taken the<BR>early start on January 2 -- the weeks and months, and in some cases<BR>years, of preparation came to fruition with the firing of the start gun<BR>by Deputy Minister of Defence Ronnie Kasrils at 3pm, and they were led<BR>off by the Whitbread 60 Corum Meteorite skippered by Frenchman Pierre<BR>Mas and German Hasso Plattner's hi-tech ILC 70 Fancourt's Morning Glory<BR>down to the first mark off Granger Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rounding just astern of Corum Meteorite, Fancourt's Morning Glory's<BR>spinnaker was the first to fly, however, and she surged ahead to lead<BR>round the second mark off Mouille Point -- and take the newly instituted<BR>Telkom Trophy as the first yacht to do so -- before setting a westerly<BR>course to clear Robben Island to seaward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First of the South African entries round the second mark was the new<BR>Simonis 60 Warrior skippered by Rick Nankin, but opting instead to take<BR>full advantage of the south-easter, led the majority of the remainder of<BR>the fleet out of Table Bay on the &quot;traditional&quot; spinnaker run inshore of<BR>Robben Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fleet soon started to spread, however, and by the end of the<BR>first day at sea, during which Fancourt's Morning Glory covered a 24the smallest yachts at the rear, with Warrior marginally in the lead on<BR>hour race record of 330 miles, some 150 miles separated the maxis from<BR>handicap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But day two belonged to the Lavranos-designed 77-foot maxi Daly's<BR>International Insurances skippered by Mike Daly sailing a more westerly<BR>course than the leaders and notching up 296 miles to put her into the<BR>lead on handicap, before reverting to the more north-westerly routing as<BR>her wind ran out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the end of the third day, Fancourt's Morning Glory had<BR>consolidated her lead to almost 40 miles ahead of a neck-and-neck<BR>Nicorette skippered by Swede Ludde Ingvall and Corum Meteorite following<BR>a slightly more southerly route, as well as moving into first place on<BR>handicap, four minutes ahead of Nicorette, while Warrior had slipped to<BR>fourth, behind third-placed Wizard with Jan Reuvers at the helm showing<BR>her form after a slow start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the cruiser monohull class, Durban yacht Dream Reach skippered by<BR>Colin Bryson held a marginal lead over Richard Holloway's Aquacoco,<BR>while in the multihull class, Colin Kenny's catamaran Manx -- sporting a<BR>revolutionary unstayed carbon fibre rig -- had moved into first place<BR>ahead of early leader Basic Instinct skippered by Kieran Draper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs, the old<BR>stalwart of the South African political theatre, Pik Botha openly<BR>concedes that Mossgas was a purely strategic investment that made<BR>absolutely no economic sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, so categorical is he that he wryly points out,o If this had<BR>happened in a private company, the board of directors would have been<BR>fired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barring the irony, the statement about one more apartheid white<BR>elephant, is illustrative of the current privatisation debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gas into oil conversion plant doubled its projected costs, so<BR>even though the plant is now producing a cash profit, it will never<BR>manage to put a dent in the R11-billion that it eventually cost the<BR>state. This, however, is history.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha concedes that he would never have taken that cabinet decision<BR>again; the question that now prevails is, what to do with it, and who<BR>should do it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A brief summary of the &quot;conundrum&quot;, as cabinet has characterised the<BR>issue, is difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mossgas and the Central Energy Fund (CEF) are pushing for an<BR>investment of R840-million in the Mossgas plant, in order to develop<BR>satellite fields and to introduce compression, from which they expect to<BR>yield a net income of about R2,5-billion in 26 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These figures have been challenged on the basis that the projected<BR>income was taking into account artificial elements, like tariff<BR>protection, and synfuel levy, which in light of the deregulation and<BR>rationalisation of government involvement in liquid fuels, is falsely<BR>premised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The monitoring committee has opposed this, although it is prepared to<BR>contemplate limited compression, and has demanded that a survey of the<BR>marketability of Mossgas be undertaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prospective buyer, or &quot;invisible man&quot;, is being negotiated with<BR>the appointed consultants Rand Merchant Bank and international<BR>consultants Arthur D Little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the prospective buyers include: a troika composed of Sasol,<BR>Sentrachem and AECI, who plan to convert Mossgas into methanol<BR>production; an elusive Taiwanese option that brings into focus South<BR>Africa's continued flirtation with the wrong part of China; Sasol;<BR>Gencor; and even a recent suggestion from Deputy President Thabo Mbeki<BR>that Malaysia is willing to bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deadline for the consultants to make a judgment call is the end<BR>of February, and while Botha is reluctant to estimate a price tag, what<BR>he does say is that a decision needs to be taken urgently on whether to<BR>invest, as the oil well is about to run dry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The projected 25-year supply has dwindled to a mere five which means<BR>that the elephant will lose even more investment appeal, if production<BR>stops altogether in 1997 and Mossgas loses its cash-positive position. A<BR>decision on whether to invest the R840-million is of dire necessity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question needs to be asked: why should the government privatise<BR>if there is an option of relative profitability? Neil Morrison of Rand<BR>Merchant Bank states that &quot;To proceed with privatisation or changing the<BR>role of the state, it must demonstrably lead to tangible benefits for<BR>the various stakeholders, in particular labour and the historically<BR>disadvantaged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wielding his double-edged sword, Botha is the first to concede that<BR>oil is one of those strategic trump cards for any country, and yet<BR>questions the rationale of state involvement in industries in which it<BR>has very little expertise, resources and skill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The much-slammed Moseneke report, as well as the upcoming Cosatu<BR>strike, bring the question into bold relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In determining the country's long-term interests, the urgency of<BR>certain decisions takes on tragic proportions. Botha attempts to resolve<BR>the conundrum with a typical rough and ready, diplomatic answer, &quot;Prize<BR>number one, for me is to sell it but also to negotiate that the new<BR>owner produces a new product, so as to continue to generate economic<BR>stability and development in that part of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is full of those grand Rhodes-like visions, for development,<BR>eloquently conjuring up images of the Southern African Power Pool<BR>agreement to develop the Zaire rapids, solar power projects to be<BR>facilitated by the CEF, and tourist attractions in the Soutpan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But most evidently the question of what is really in the country's<BR>good still troubles him. &quot;Do you save on foreign exchange and earn<BR>income on fuel, or go for the jobsaving option that a conversion to<BR>methanol would provide? Perhaps a combination is more viable by<BR>retaining the state interest in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The argument could also follow a different route, create long-term<BR>viability, but lose foreign exchange and suffer temporary job losses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is clear about electricity, though, &quot;It is not in our interest to<BR>privatise, there needs to be centralisation, our status quo is a result<BR>of the fragmentation, there exist over 300 suppliers, and 2 000 tariffs,<BR>there is no clarity or security for potential investors. I have great<BR>faith in Dr Ian McRae (head of the National Electricity Forum) - he is a<BR>man of vision and imagination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is probably imagination that is needed in the question of<BR>privatisation. Morrison argues, &quot;Government has to make the choice<BR>whether to squander the future as a competitive economy or to make hard<BR>adjustments right now. Policy matters, the decisions government makes,<BR>affects directly which shareholders benefit and which don't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As to Mossgas, Rand Merchant Bank is still mum, arguing that it is<BR>premature to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha, in a pithy allegory, sums it up by quoting a phrase that exvan die lewe is daar geen program nie&quot; which Botha then slyly adapts to<BR>cabinet minister Piet du Plessis has on his prison wall, &quot;In die konsert<BR>&quot;In die konsert van Mossgas is daar geen program nie.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) January 12, 1996 by Simon Segal</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The South African Agricultural Union (SAAU) estimates<BR>that the good rains, should they continue into March could add 1,5<BR>percentage points to South Africa's economic growth rate in 1996 (and 25<BR>percent to South Africa's gross agricultural income of R30-billion in<BR>1995).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This will account for around one-quarter of total economic growth in<BR>1996. It will also raise agriculture's contribution to gross domestic<BR>product (GDP) from 4,6 percent in 1995 to more than six percent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only region in South Africa not to benefit from the rains are<BR>parts of the Northern Transvaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main beneficiary of the rain is the maize industry which is now<BR>looking forward to a crop of seven to 10-million tons. Last year's crop<BR>was 4,4-million tons. Local consumption is around seven million tons, so<BR>South Africa should be able to export maize this year and restore its<BR>stockpile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wheat crop is estimated at 2,3-million tons (1,8-million last<BR>year) which should cover domestic consumption. Horticultural output is<BR>expected to grow 10 to 12 percent, while animal production should remain<BR>constant as herds are rebuilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the rains, the SAAU does not expect food prices to drop over<BR>the year as demand picks up when world food stocks are at their lowest<BR>levels in 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those foods that South Africa exports - mainly fruit and wine - could<BR>see price rises of over 10 percent. Other price rises should average<BR>around 10 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rains will also not reverse the narrowing trade gap between<BR>agricultural imports and exports. In 1994, when South Africa enjoyed a<BR>bumper agricultural season, agricultural exports totaled R8,3-billion<BR>and imports R4,9-billion. The Agricultural department reckons in 1995<BR>exports were up 15 percent (to R9,5-billion) and imports 20 percent (to<BR>R6- billion). The rise in imports was largely due to loopholes in meat<BR>importation which has subsequently been tightened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For 1996 the &quot;guesstimate&quot; is for exports to rise 10 percent (to<BR>R10,5-billion) and imports to increase by 15 percent (to R6,8-billion).<BR>The trend is clear - in a deregulating agricultural industry, imports<BR>are increasing at a more rapid rate than exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the rains will bring more food, although not cheaper, and<BR>contribute favourably on a net basis to South Africa's balance of<BR>payments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On completing Form Two, he went on to another church-run school,<BR>Emmarentia High School to complete his school leaving certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But his stay at the school was prematurely halted when, three months<BR>before he was due to write his finals, he was expelled. The pupils had<BR>been protesting against the creation of the Republic of South Africa and<BR>some were woken up at two in the morning. Torches were shone in their<BR>faces and rifles poked in their ribs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They were only doing their job,&quot; Phaswana said without any<BR>bitterness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I wasn't hurt or anything like that. I was just rounded up with 10<BR>others in my class, told to dress and put on a train back to Louis<BR>Trichardt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They told me that I would not be able to write my finals, even to<BR>finish school at all, unless I joined the police or the civil service,<BR>of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Phaswana had registered to write his finals and had an<BR>examination number, which was all the examiners needed. So he was sent<BR>to a school in a rural area where he wrote his matric, obtaining a<BR>university exemption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because he was good at languages, Phaswana set his heart on a degree<BR>leading to a career in court interpreting. His brother agreed to help<BR>him finance his studies, but either forgot his promise or found it too<BR>difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anxious not to lose a good student, the university of the North<BR>contacted the then joint service company run by BP and Shell and<BR>arranged a bursary. The two companies set up in their own right in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He went on to study part-time for an Honours degree in energy<BR>economics through Unisa and for a Masters degree in Dutch literature<BR>through Rand Afrikaans University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the meantime, he needed a job and went to the oil company saying:<BR>&quot;Listen here, you gave me a bursary, now give me a job.&quot; The company was<BR>somewhat taken aback, but agreed to take him on in its personnel<BR>department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hadn't a clue about BP, personnel or anything else, so I asked<BR>what it was they did. When I gathered that they sat in an office and<BR>made plans for the chaps working at the bottom of the organisation, I<BR>said; 'Well, if that is what I am going to be doing, I think I had<BR>better go out there and work with the people on the ground. Then maybe I<BR>would become a better personnel officer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phaswana rolled drums in depots and filled rail tank cars for some<BR>years but by 1973 he was a personnel officer and identified as a fast<BR>tracker. By 1988, he was appointed a general manager responsible for<BR>various portfolios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phaswana was appointed to the board of BPSA in 1989, and in 1992 he<BR>became president of BP Nederland and BP Belgium, based in Amsterdam and<BR>Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the question of black advancement, Phaswana said that whites had<BR>little to fear from their black colleagues. Rather than complain about<BR>the lack of black skills, they should acknowledge that they themselves<BR>had been living in a restricted business environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In developing black staff, we have perhaps not applied ourselves as<BR>hard as we should,&quot; Phaswana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a difficult problem, but we could have moved faster, more<BR>fundamentally. There is headroom for everyone to grow now and that is<BR>perhaps different from the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phaswana takes over at a time when the South African oil industry is<BR>undergoing fundamental restructuring and he is under no illusions about<BR>the size of the task that faces him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After years of tight secrecy and government regulations covering<BR>virtually every aspect of the business, deregulation and a greater<BR>openness have become the order of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the most contentious issues in the industry is continued<BR>government subsidies to oil-from-coal producer Sasol. Even though these<BR>are being gradually scaled down, the fact that they continue to exist at<BR>all has been a bone of contention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We in BP do not have a problem in investing in the new refining<BR>capacity the market will soon demand,&quot; Phaswana said. &quot;The caveat is how<BR>you do this when the playing field, set by government essentially, is<BR>uneven.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The taxpayer is going to pay legal costs for former<BR>defence minister Magnus Malan and 10 senior officers in their murder<BR>trial which begins in early March in Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Malan and his co-accused, including former SADF chief General<BR>&quot;Kat&quot; Liebenberg, are accused of complicity in the massacre of 13<BR>civilians at KwaMakhuta in KwaZulu-Natal in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The indictment against Malan and the others includes allegations<BR>about a secret sub- committee of the State Security Council which<BR>approved millions of rands for training Inkatha hit squads in the<BR>Caprivi from 1986.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malan and others were arrested after the Durban-based Investigation<BR>Task Unit found secret documents linking them to the training of the<BR>hit-squads and the execution of the massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to a Mail &amp; Guardian inquiry this week, Lieutenant-Colonel<BR>Damien de Lange, on behalf of the Minister of Defence, said defence<BR>costs of former SADF as well those of South African National Defence<BR>Force (SANDF) members involved in trials are and will be borne by the<BR>ministry. He would not explain how this decision had been reached beyond<BR>saying it was &quot;at the instruction of the Treasury for Finance&quot;. He said<BR>he presumed the decision had been taken by the Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Lange said there was no provision to recover the money if the<BR>accused were found guilty. He said some would probably not be able to<BR>pay back the huge sums involved in their defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office of the President spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the payment<BR>of the defence costs of the Malan 20 was never discussed in Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African taxpayer has already paid out more than R3-million<BR>in legal costs for the defence of former policeman, Vlakplaas commander<BR>Eugene de Kock, in a trial which will probably end in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African National Congress spokesman Carl Niehaus said the<BR>organisation was &quot;extremely uncomfortable&quot; with the situation, but<BR>understood the dilemma facing the ministry, and that as long as there<BR>was a legal provision it was difficult for the ministry not to abide by<BR>it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However M&amp;G has learned there is some unhappiness about the<BR>government paying for the defence of Malan and his co-accused in the<BR>recently formed Secretariat for Defence. The Secretariat was established<BR>to ensure civilian accountability in the military.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Congress of South African Trade Unions cannot<BR>count on the support of its main affiliate, the 300 000-strong National<BR>Union of Mineworkers (NUM), in its planned anti- privatisation strike on<BR>Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although, as a Cosatu affiliate, the NUM is bound to some degree by<BR>the federation's decision to strike, ambivalence is being displayed<BR>among some key NUM members.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike, aimed at what Cosatu terms the &quot;unilateral restructuring<BR>of state assets&quot;, could fail, with one senior unionist, who wished to<BR>remain anonymous, describing Cosatu general secretary Sam Shilowa's<BR>militant stance as &quot;mere posturing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NUM general secretary Kgalema Motlanthe was tight-lipped about the<BR>strike, saying it was &quot;inappropriate to comment&quot;, since talks between<BR>Cosatu and various other parties could &quot;succeed in reconciling<BR>differences&quot; and possibly reach agreement on the objectives of<BR>restructuring within the public and other sectors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All federation decisions are binding on affiliates,'' Motlanthe<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, should the NUM, as a backbone union of the federation, fail<BR>to render its support, Cosatu's &quot;show of strength&quot; will not make an<BR>impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu spokesperson Nowetu Mpati said she did not doubt the NUM would<BR>support the strike, especially as it participated in the decisiondistributed pamphlets in all the regions,&quot; Mpati said, adding Cosatu's<BR>making process. &quot;The strike will continue as planned, and we have<BR>affiliates had pledged &quot;strong support&quot; for the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike is, however, ill-timed, with factory workers returning a<BR>day before Cosatu plans to show its &quot;force of strength&quot;. The Federation<BR>of South African Labour Unions (Fedsal) also indicated last week that it<BR>had no intention of participating in the strike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) January 12, 1996 by Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela's high-profile Children's<BR>Fund has netted more than R12- million since its inception last year,<BR>with a further R24-million pledged to it. while humbler non-government<BR>organisations (NGOs) are battling for money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, NGOs are frightened that Mandela's Midas touch is<BR>proving so successful that it is threatening their own ability to raise<BR>funds to care for South Africa's poor and homeless children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These NGOs, many of which have lost foreign funders in post-apartheid<BR>South Africa, are desperate for larger donations from big business to<BR>help disadvantaged children, and are eyeing the millions in Mandela's<BR>fund with envy and reservations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela's Children's Fund has received R12- million, with a further<BR>R24-million pledged to it over the next five years. There are now 28<BR>members in the President's Club --individuals, businesses and foreign<BR>governments that have matched Mandela's donation to the fund and whose<BR>members are giving R150 000 or more over five years. The club includes<BR>US actor Denzil Washington, the Norwegian government, Barlows, CocaThe marketing director of the South African National Council for<BR>Cola, Pierre Cardin and M-Net.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child and Family Welfare, Hennie Oosthuizen, said this week: &quot;I believe<BR>that the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund has the potential to take donors<BR>away from child welfare organisations because it can offer exposure to<BR>donors, and all we can offer is accountability. We need some of that<BR>money in our organisation and we could use it successfully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief executive trustee of the Fund, Jeremy Ractliffe, responded<BR>by saying, &quot;I do not know of any of our donors who have given to the<BR>Mandela's Children Fund through not funding some other NGO in the field<BR>we concentrate on ... I would welcome discussions with NGOs who feel<BR>that they have lost out to the Fund.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It cannot be disputed that Mandela's name sanctifies his Children's<BR>Fund, giving it a political and emotional appeal of international<BR>standing. (Those who become part of the President's Club receive a<BR>certificate signed by Mandela, as well as a photograph of the donor with<BR>Mandela.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smaller, humbler NGOs -- which have worked for decades in South<BR>Africa's forgotten communities -- are throwing up their hands in<BR>despair, saying that they just cannot compete with the Mandela name.<BR>This is ironic, given the fact that these NGOs were the unofficial<BR>conduit for foreign funds during apartheid years, funds which, in many<BR>instances, helped prepare South Africa and the African National Congress<BR>for the transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairperson of the Save the Children Fund, Mary Hanna, said this week<BR>that it was becoming increasingly difficult to raise money and that<BR>high-profile funds were attracting donations which had previously gone<BR>to Save the Children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The demands are increasing and the funds are not ... we have had to<BR>severely curtail our nutrition programmes in places like the Northern<BR>Province, for example, and as far as we know there is no other<BR>organisation working there to take our place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg Child Welfare has retrenched 22 social workers this year<BR>to cope with the drop in funding, according to Anne Bown, manager of<BR>funding and public relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bown said people were much less generous than they used to be and<BR>that they were struggling to find donors, especially needed as the state<BR>had cut its subsidy by R1-million, and foreign governments were giving<BR>to the Reconstruction and Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The funding and development manager of the Child Welfare Society in<BR>Cape Town, Jetty Botes, said that the society's 1996 to 1997 budget was<BR>short by more than a million rand and that it would have to cut projects<BR>unless saved by a windfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Corporations provide 15 to 20 percent of our funding currently --<BR>this is less than it used to be,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ractliffe said this week that information and application forms were<BR>freely available and that he had distributed R3 500 brochures about the<BR>Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Fund focused on organisations that were on the coal-face<BR>of development work and working directly with communities. The fund's<BR>brochure states that it assists organisations working with disadvantaged<BR>children, with a particular emphasis on children in detention, children<BR>who have had no formal education, who are handicapped, and homeless<BR>children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ractliffe said 92 grants had already been made, many to projects<BR>involving street children. Altogether R1,5-million had been disbursed<BR>and more than R5-million would be paid out in 1996, he said. The Fund<BR>intended to allocate not less than 75 percent of the interest from its<BR>capital base and 25 percent of its annual opening capital to projects<BR>every year, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mandela Children's Fund has, in conjunction with other NGOs,<BR>helped to fund a Youth Development Centre at Leeuwkop Prison in Gauteng,<BR>a similar centre at Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal, and has donated R38 000<BR>to the NGO Streetwise. The decisions about which NGOs and organisations<BR>to fund would be made at quarterly meetings by a committee of 14<BR>managing trustees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the NGOs' official line is one of regret and restraint, their<BR>off-the-record comments tend to be resentful and, at time, vicious.<BR>&quot;Nobody wants to say anything because it is politically incorrect to<BR>criticise the Mandela fund,&quot; said the source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ractliffe is not exempt from criticism. He has been accused of<BR>trying to turn the Mandela fund into a personal empire, and of eluding<BR>telephone calls by NGOs attempting to establish information about the<BR>fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ractliffe is the fund,&quot; said a source. &quot;You can't get past him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ractliffe said, &quot;I have no desire to create a personal empire. All<BR>the information about the Fund is freely available. People who want to<BR>talk to me should keep trying, because I am always here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) January 12, 1996 by Eddie Koch and Mehlo Mvelase</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Police either colluded in the Christmas Day massacre<BR>at Shobashobane or are guilty of negligence in the run-up to the attack<BR>that left 19 people dead in the KwaZulu-Natal village, according to a<BR>television documentary to be broadcast by SABC's Agenda programme on<BR>Sunday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The documentary includes strong criticisms from Captain Shaun<BR>Vollenhoven, former commander of the police station near Shobashobane,<BR>of the co-ordination of the security operation in the area before the<BR>attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vollenhoven, who has been transferred from the police station at his<BR>own request, feels that his efforts to introduce new and more community&quot;The old police structure which we are trying to change now is still<BR>friendly policing methods in the area had been consistently undermined.<BR>not ready for change,&quot; says Vollenoven in response to queries from the<BR>film crew about lack of co-ordination in the way police behaved before<BR>and during the massacre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The documentary, made by Mail &amp; Guardian Television with the SABC,<BR>includes an in-depth examination of how the massacre took place and<BR>explores the possibilities for restoring order to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of Vollenhoven's key criticisms relates to the lack of<BR>communication between the police station and various other security<BR>operatives in the area. He was, he said, unable to provide an<BR>explanation for the fact that an Internal Stability Unit patrol, which<BR>was supposed to have been on duty in the area, was not present at the<BR>time of the attack in Shobashobane. He was also not informed about<BR>houses being searched and weapons allegedly being confiscated in<BR>Shobashobane on the day before the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was not aware of the search by outside units,&quot; says Vollenhoven.<BR>&quot;This creates a perception that police are siding with one party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The documentary points out that these anomalies occurred even though<BR>African National Congress leaders and independent monitors had informed<BR>senior police officers that an attack on Shobashobane could be expected<BR>in the Christmas period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has asked Neville Melville, police<BR>reporting officer for KwaZulu-Natal and former advocate, to head up a<BR>special task force that will probe allegations of police complicity or<BR>negligence regarding the massacre. Members of the Investigative Task<BR>Unit, a crack team of detectives that reports directly to Mufamadi, will<BR>help with this probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police Commissioner George Fivaz has also sent a top team of 34<BR>detectives to Port Shepstone to investigate the massacre, headed by<BR>Pretoria detective Bushie Engelbrecht. Fivaz announced in a press<BR>statement that extra informers would be sent into the area and that the<BR>use of extra powers, granted to the provincial commissioner under the<BR>Police Act, was also possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Engelbrecht's men began interviewing eyewitnesses and survivors of<BR>the massacre on Tuesday this week. The team has issued warrants of<BR>arrest for four suspects believed to have been involved in the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, a National Public Order Policing (Pop) Unit will be set<BR>up in Natal under command of former ISU commander Vernon Hunter. The Pop<BR>teams will set up temporary bases in various hotspots of the province<BR>and will concentrate on the South Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These moves represent an effort by the national police commissioner province. The Inkatha Freedom Party has insisted policing is primarily a<BR>- along with Mufamadi's office -- to stamp their authority on the<BR>provincial matter and has already signaled its intention to oppose<BR>&quot;unilateral&quot; intervention by national authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are worried by Fivaz's comment that more spies will be sent into<BR>the province as we have been victims of unlawful espionage on our<BR>officials by members of the intelligence agencies,&quot; said IFP secretary<BR>general Ziba Jiyane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Inkatha leader says the new measures on the South Coast could<BR>amount to anti-Inkatha intervention by central government in the<BR>province. &quot;We are not saying the central government should not be<BR>involved in security matters in KwaZulu-Natal. But Schedule Six of the<BR>Constitution says policing is also a provincial issue and as long at it<BR>(national intervention) is done in a unilateral way this is invariably a<BR>partisan approach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The action by the national police authorities and Jiyane's response<BR>indicates that the Shobashabane killings may have initiated a major<BR>conflict between the central and provincial governments over who will<BR>control the way KwaZulu-Natal is policed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It's been a long time coming, but Dirk Coetzee has had<BR>enough. He now regrets having spoken out in 1989 about killer squads in<BR>the South African Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His confession six years ago about his own role in sanctioned murders<BR>and his breathtaking exposure of the rot deep in the South African<BR>security police has brought him little but grief. When he first told<BR>Vrye Weekblad reporter Jacques Pauw his story, both he and his claims<BR>were ridiculed in much of the then mainstream media. He had to spend<BR>four years in uncomfortable exile, in constant fear of being<BR>assassinated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the propaganda machine within the South African Police, and the<BR>remnants of that machine which is still functioning, has pursued him<BR>relentlessly. This week was the final straw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His old colleague, National Police Commissioner George Fivaz (who<BR>probably owes Coetzee at least a good lunch for alerting the African<BR>National Congress that he was &quot;untainted&quot; and therefore probably the<BR>best compromise to be the future National Commissioner), chose to ignore<BR>him and go public with another man's accusations against him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fivaz decided to endorse a version of events given to him by another<BR>former security policeman Inspector HT Moodley: Moodley claims Dirk<BR>Coetzee told him he was under orders to bug senior policemen at a<BR>meeting at National Intelligence Agency headquarters six weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coetzee scoffs at this. His version is that Moodley, &quot;a pleasant<BR>fellow,&quot; visited him at NIA HQ and asked him to make a statement about<BR>the assassination of ANC lawyer Griffiths Mxenge in Durban in 1981.<BR>Mxenge's brother had decided to ask the police to charge Coetzee after<BR>participating in a Yorkshire Television documentary in which Coetzee<BR>once again repeated his confession, that under orders from his superiors<BR>in the security police, he sent his men to kill Mxenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coetzee says he told Moodley at the &quot;relaxed&quot; meeting he would not<BR>make a statement to the police, but he would be telling the Mxenge<BR>story, for the last time, to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coetzee, uncomfortable in his NIA job as a &quot;spook&quot;, says he has<BR>neither access to &quot;bugging&quot; devices, nor has he ever been involved in<BR>bugging operations in his life, and that he is in the wrong department<BR>at the NIA to do any bugging, even if he knew how. He also claims that<BR>nobody in the NIA asked him to do any bugging, ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Coetzee neither Fivaz nor anyone else, including his<BR>bosses at NIA, asked him his version of the bugging allegations<BR>contained in a report by Independent Newspapers' investigative unit,<BR>Spectrum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coetzee learned of Fivaz's statement early last Thursday morning when<BR>a friend phoned him to tell him the newspaper reports were being aired<BR>on radio news bulletins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coetzee is bewildered about why he was the last to find out, and<BR>said: &quot;Let me and Moodley have a lie detector test.&quot; Moodley refused to<BR>talk to the M&amp;G, and referred us to Fivaz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coetzee is not supposed to talk to the press. He would far prefer to<BR>be back in the police, which he left on &quot;medical grounds&quot; after a<BR>disciplinary hearing in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He's an unconventional, outspoken wild card for the new government.<BR>In an interview with Tribute magazine before the elections he accused<BR>the ANC intelligence community of incompetence, and that didn't do his<BR>career much good. And he's not sure, after this week and his outrage in<BR>the press, what his job prospects are like with the NIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he's deeply hurt that some men who covered up and lied about the<BR>hit squads are generals in the police, while he is ill-placed in the<BR>state spy shop. Coetzee is not an angel, but so far he has never been<BR>caught in a lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fivaz told the M&amp;G late on Thursday he had at no stage commented on<BR>the veracity of the allegations against Coetzee. He said he had<BR>discussed the bugging with intelligence boss Mo Shaik, who had decided<BR>to let the matter rest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Parliament's watchdog over the intelligence<BR>community faces its most crucial test as it prepares to uncover the<BR>truth behind the police spying scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence thrashed out its terms<BR>of reference for its investigation into police claims that top members<BR>were being spied on by agents of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA),<BR>which has denied the allegations, during a five-hour meeting behind<BR>closed doors this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have already had our battles with the intelligence services. How<BR>we deal with this case is a test for us as far as the public is<BR>concerned,&quot; committee chair, African National Congress MP Lindiwe<BR>Sisulu-Guma, told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee is responsible for monitoring the two national<BR>intelligence services -- the NIA, which deals with domestic threats, and<BR>the South African Secret Service, which deals with external threats --<BR>as well as the intelligence arms of the police and defence force. Its<BR>power lies in its legislated right to approve or veto budgets: &quot;We hold<BR>the purse-strings,&quot; said Sisulu-Guma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public interviews of seven nominees shortlisted for the post of<BR>Inspector General of Intelligence -- a civilian who will deal with<BR>complaints of abuses from the public and within the services themselves<BR>-- start on February 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The candidates have been drawn from a list of nominees submitted by<BR>all seven political parties and three nominated by members of the<BR>public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final choice must be approved by a 75 percent majority in<BR>Parliament -- more than the two-thirds required to amend the<BR>constitution, because of the nature of the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since it started work four months ago, the committee has had to<BR>scrutinise intelligence budgets, learn about the services it is supposed<BR>to monitor, and find a balance between transparency and secrecy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's the most difficult balancing act imaginable. We must do it<BR>properly or the concept of transparency will be destroyed.&quot; It will<BR>report to Parliament on its work during February. &quot;Nothing will be<BR>excluded without our first consulting all the political parties and<BR>nothing will be included that jeopardises the national interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee meets on February 7 to consider reports on the spying<BR>scandal it has called for from the police and the NIA, and to decide<BR>whom to subpoena to give evidence. It will investigate the truth of<BR>allegations of the use of bugs and other surveillance of senior police<BR>officers and prepare a report, with recommendations, for parliament and<BR>the executive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The task team appointed by Deputy President Thabo<BR>Mbeki to look at the media will be reviewing the South African<BR>Communications Services (SACS) -- government's current communications<BR>model -- in a bid to find new and more effective means of disseminating<BR>government information to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A brief for Friday's meeting sent by Mbeki's office to all ten<BR>members of the task team urges participants to concentrate on<BR>investigating, among others issues, the relationship between SACS and<BR>those print and electronic media structures not linked to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freedom of Expression Institute chairman Raymond Louw, who is a task<BR>team member, said the team would also be reviewing the government's<BR>existing policy on communication and placing &quot;special emphasis&quot; on re&quot;Ownership and control of the media, and how it affects government<BR>assessing affirmative action policies.<BR>communications is also one of the key issues for the task team,&quot; Louw<BR>said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another member of the task team, the Sowetan's political editor,<BR>Mathatha Tsedu, said foreign control of the media by large conglomerates<BR>and monopolies should be a priority for the task team because foreign<BR>ownership impeded the process of ensuring a &quot;diversity of voices&quot; among<BR>the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I believe that the large groups controlling the media should<BR>unbundle and relinquish shares. Sowetan staffers have appealed to the<BR>Independent Group to sell its stake in the Sowetan and allow them to buy<BR>shares. This displays the urgency with which our team has to discuss<BR>foreign control of the media,&quot; Tsedu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 80 percent of South African print media is controlled by<BR>four major players: namely, Times Media Limited, Independent Newspapers<BR>Holdings, Perskor and the Nasionale Pers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although members agreed on the issue of spurring affirmative action,<BR>some feared that government may resort to &quot;undesirable means&quot; of<BR>implementation such as using government advertising money to implement<BR>the policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Some of the world's greatest players will from this<BR>weekend grace South African soccer pitches. This is despite the debacle<BR>surrounding the withdrawal of champions Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria have the largest contingent of players plying their trade in<BR>Europe, but the 15 nations taking part in the tournament are packed with<BR>players who are playing for top overseas clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the world's leading clubs broaden their search for talent, Africa<BR>has become a good hunting ground for them, and stars from many poor<BR>African countries are now earning fortunes with the rich European clubs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most well known of these is George Weah, who is having a great<BR>season with Italy's AC Milan. Since re-admission, South Africa has also<BR>exported many local stars with John &quot;Shoes&quot; Moshoeu, playing in Turkey,<BR>being the most expensive player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GEORGE WEAH (Liberia)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GEORGE APPONG WEAH is simply the best player on earth at the moment.<BR>World soccer's governing body, Fifa, confirmed that on Monday when Weah<BR>was voted World Player of the Year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has played much of his football outside his war-torn country,<BR>starring for a French club before moving to the Italian Serie A giants<BR>AC Milan. But Weah's love for Liberia has led him to contribute some of<BR>his earning towards the national team and he has inspired them to their<BR>first appearance in the African nations Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National coach Wilfred Lardner knows that in Weah he has someone<BR>around whom he can build a strong team capable of upsetting the<BR>tournament's favourites. Liberian minister of sport Francois Massaquoi<BR>said: &quot;He has shown the world that Liberians are not just killers, but<BR>also decent people with talent and mastery of certain crafts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Nigeria out of the finals and Weah leading their attack, Liberia<BR>have a good chance of advancing to the knockout stage of the tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANTHONY YEBOAH (Ghana)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANTHONY YEBOAH has not lost the goal touch that prompted England's<BR>Leeds United to pay $3,4-million to Eintracht Frankfurt for his<BR>services. He was a prolific goalscorer in the German Bundesliga and<BR>Yeboah's continued appetite for what he is paid to do earned him the<BR>goal of the month award in September and October last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about his much-publicised squabble with team captain Abedi<BR>&quot;Pele&quot; Ayew, he said: &quot;Blown out of proportion&quot;. However, Ghana 's<BR>failure in Tunisia 94 was attributed to internal quarrels. Having failed<BR>in two previous tournaments, Yeboah knows that this may be his last<BR>chance. The 30-year-old striker has a lethal shot with both feet and if<BR>his 25-yard scorchers do not elude him, he may be the top goal scorer of<BR>the tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DOCTOR KHUMALO (South Africa)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WAY back in 1992 in Zimbabwe, when South Africa were beaten 4-1 in a<BR>African Nations Cup qualifier, the most talked about player then was<BR>Doctor Khumalo (right), with the Zimbabweans dubbing him a &quot;nurse&quot;. He<BR>has come a long way since then, and has put in some assured and skillful<BR>performances for the national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kaizer Chiefs idol always plays in patches but with a strong<BR>contingent around him he can rise to the occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He spent the latter part of last year rueing a botched deal with a<BR>club in Argentina but next season he is likely to play in the revamped<BR>American league. Khumalo will be looking to make a big impression at<BR>this tournament so that he can clinch himself a better deal in a more<BR>competitive league than the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KALUSHA BWALYA (Zambia)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TEAM captain Kalusha Bwalya will best be remembered for leading<BR>Zambia to the finals of the 1994 tournament in Tunisia against Nigeria<BR>after he was one of the survivors of the 1993 plane crash in Gabon which<BR>killed all but three members of the national squad. &quot;Great Lusha&quot; is<BR>still with us today because he simply missed the flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who saw the 1994 finals will remember how close Bwalya came to<BR>equalising in the final against Nigeria, hitting the crossbar with a 40m<BR>drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 33-year-old Bwaly is currently playing for Club America in Mexico<BR>and with Johnson Bwalya and Kenneth Malitoli alongside him, this leftclose in Tunisia with a makeshift squad, this time around they may hit<BR>footed midfielder could give goalkeepers a hard time. Having come that<BR>the jackpot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maputo - Letter from the American Ambassador to Mozambique, Dennis<BR>Jett<BR>to the publication MediaFax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dear Editor of Mediafax:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Permit me to respond to your editorial of December 19. In that<BR>editorial you called the American Embassy's refusal to give Joe Hanlon<BR>interviews with Embassy and USAID personnel a &quot;flagrant violation of<BR>freedom of the press, freedom of expression and the right of person to<BR>be informed.&quot; Mr. Hanlon, AIM and Domingo have all made similar<BR>accusations. You also said that I, as ambassador, have no right to ban<BR>any embassy employee from speaking to a journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clearly you do not understand the values behind the concepts you are<BR>so vigorously defending. I do not think this arises from different<BR>definitions of the terms involved, even though the American constitution<BR>and the Mozambican constitution are not identical on these points. The<BR>American constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom of<BR>expression by declaring that the Congress shall make no law abridging<BR>the freedom of press, or of speech. It should therefore be obvious to<BR>anyone that an embassy cannot violate freedom of the press in the<BR>American sense of term, since only the parliament in a particular<BR>country can pass a law that would interfere with a journalist's ability<BR>to express or publish his opinions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mozambican constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom<BR>of speech as well, but uses somewhat different words to accomplish this.<BR>Article 74 of the constitution states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;1. All the citizens shall have the right to freedom of expression<BR>and to freedom of the press, as well as the right to information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Freedom of expression, which includes the right to disseminate<BR>one's opinion by all legal means, and the right to information, shall<BR>not be limited by censorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Freedom of press shall include in particular the freedom of<BR>journalistic expression and creativity, access to sources of<BR>information, protection of professional independence and<BR>confidentiality, and the right to publish newspapers and other<BR>publications.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the Embassy has done nothing to prevent Mr. Hanlon from<BR>expressing his thoughts or publishing them, clearly the only question<BR>that arises is whether the embassy has violated Mr. Hanlon's right to<BR>information or his right to access to sources of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique's press law, law number 18/91, contains article 29<BR>entitled &quot;Access to sources of information.&quot; It states &quot;Access to<BR>OFFICIAL (emphasis added) sources of information shall be granted to<BR>journalists in the course of their work.&quot; Would the distinguished editor<BR>of MediaFax have his readers believe that Article 29, which only<BR>mentions &quot;official&quot; sources of information, is referring to the<BR>information of all governments in the world and not just that of the<BR>Mozambican government?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any case, I and other members of this Embassy have frequently made<BR>ourselves available to the press in those cases where we believed it was<BR>productive to do so. At the same time, Mr.Hanlon's request for<BR>interviews was not the first we have declined because we thought it<BR>would not be useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since access to official sources of information obviously does not<BR>apply, that only leaves the question whether Mr. Hanlon's right to<BR>information could have been violated. Article 3 of law 18/91 entitled<BR>&quot;right to information&quot; states: &quot;In the field of the press, the right to<BR>information means the ability of every citizen to inform himself and to<BR>be informed of facts and opinions of national and international<BR>consequence, as well as the right to release information, opinions and<BR>ideas through the press.&quot; The citizens of Mozambique therefore have the<BR>right to inform themselves and be infomed by journalists. Would the<BR>distinguished editor of Mediafax have his readers believe that this<BR>should be interpreted that any time anyone refuses to answer any<BR>question of any journalist, that the rights of all 16 million<BR>Mozambicans have just been violated?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Has the distinguished editor of MediaFax never heard in his<BR>professional career the response &quot;no comment&quot;? Has he never had a phone<BR>call that was not returned or never had a question he posed that was not<BR>fully answered? If this has happened in the past, why have you not<BR>informed the people of Mozambique in each and every instance in which<BR>their rights have been violated?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think the above argument demonstrates the total absurdity of the<BR>assertion that the Embassy's decision regarding Mr. Hanlon violated<BR>freedom of the press, freedom of expression or the right of the people<BR>to be informed. You also made the point, however, that as ambassador, I<BR>did not have the right to ban anyone in the embassy from speaking to a<BR>journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When it comes to expressing official government opinions during<BR>official working hours -- which is what Mr. Hanlon requested -- I not<BR>only have the right, but the obligation to ensure that official<BR>positions are expressed coherently and consistently. I also have the<BR>obligation to the taxpayers of the United States to see that their money<BR>is not wasted. We have spent many hours in the past answering Mr.<BR>Hanlon's questions, which failed to improve the quality of his<BR>reporting. Using more time of embassy personnel to respond to more of<BR>Mr. Hanlon's questions, given his ideological orientation and lack of<BR>objectivity, would therefore be a waste of such resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Would the distinguished editor of MediaFax have his readers believe<BR>that any journalist has the right to ask any question of any employee of<BR>any organization at any time and that no one in a position of authority,<BR>be it a manager, minister or ambassador, has the right to determine<BR>whether or how the question will be answered? If that is the case,<BR>Article 27 of law 18/91, which lists the rights of journalists, fails to<BR>include such a right and nowhere else in that law or in the constitution<BR>is such a right described.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe this is more than just a case of not understanding the<BR>letter of the law; it is also a fundamental lack of comprehension of the<BR>spirit of the law. This lack of understanding is not limited to this one<BR>occasion. When the Embassy's press attache wrote you in November<BR>regarding Mr. Hanlon, you took offense at her suggestion that an entity<BR>of the government like AIM perhaps doesn't understand freedom of the<BR>press. You termed this an insult to you and the other journalists who<BR>had worked at AIM and you pointed out &quot;AIM journalists had to continue<BR>to struggle a great deal for this press freedom, sometimes without<BR>success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While you may have struggled, I would agree that you did not succeed.<BR>When you were director of AIM, Renamo was never mentioned by name, but<BR>was always referred to as the &quot;armed bandits.&quot; Today AIM only describes<BR>Renamo as &quot;the former rebel movement.&quot; It never calls Renamo &quot;the<BR>largest opposition political party&quot; or even &quot;an opposition party.&quot;<BR>Frelimo, on the other hand, is always referred to as the &quot;ruling party&quot;<BR>or the &quot;governing party&quot; which is an accurate description of the present<BR>without reference to the past. Do AIM's readers need to be reminded<BR>every day that Renamo was once a rebel movement? If it is AIM's<BR>intention to teach history, in view of its successful struggle for<BR>liberation from colonialism, why isn't Frelimo ever referred to as a<BR>&quot;former rebel movement?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This problem with nomenclature is perhaps a small example of bias,<BR>but I am not the only one who doubts AIM's impartiality. The following<BR>quote regarding AIM may interest you: &quot;the service, however, causes some<BR>controversy, as many professionals are of the opinion that it is a<BR>service of governmental propaganda instead of being an information<BR>service with independence and objectivity guaranteed by law.&quot; The quote<BR>is from an article on page 5 of the August 28, 1995 issue of &quot;Savana,&quot;<BR>an excellent newspaper that I recommend you read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some would argue that it is pointless to enter into a debate about<BR>freedom of press with those who do not understand it or choose to ignore<BR>the values that are its foundation. Others say that arguing with an<BR>editor is a no-win situation since he (or she) will always have the last<BR>word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While I do not disagree with these arguments, I think it is an<BR>important debate nonetheless because the peace which Mozambique now<BR>enjoys is by no means assured. One academic study which I read recently<BR>concluded that during the last fifty years in countries where there had<BR>been civil wars that were ended through negotiation, in one half of them<BR>war broke out again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether Mozambique is part of the half that succeeds in not repeating<BR>the tragedy of the past will depend, to a large degree, on whether<BR>democracy succeeds here. Democracy can function successfully only if the<BR>institutions that are its foundations can function. In addition to a<BR>strong legislature and an independent judiciary, a free press is one of<BR>those essential institutions. Can the press be free if it is owned by<BR>the government? Is AIM your argument that it can? As the editor of the<BR>oldest independent publication in Mozambique, your opinions in this<BR>regard should be taken seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When reading the accounts of those who worked for two years to<BR>negotiate the General Peace Agreement in Rome, one theme is consistent.<BR>The mutual lack of confidence that the two parties had in each other<BR>repeatedly complicated the process. The climate created by a biased and<BR>unobjective press clearly contributed to this mutual lack of trust. The<BR>role played by the press therefore probably served to prolong the war<BR>and certainly served to make implementation of the peace more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Distinguished editor of Mediafax, perhaps you should spend less time<BR>complaining about your friend being denied an interview and more time<BR>worrying about the threat to continued peace in Mozambique posed by some<BR>of those who practice your profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since article 33 of law 18/91 describes the right to reply, I trust<BR>you will not violate my rights and will publish this letter in its<BR>entirety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Along with the hope that the New Year brings greater understanding of<BR>and appreciation for freedom of the press and freedom of expression,<BR>please accept assurances of my highest consideration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maputo - Statement by the Media Institute of South African (MISA),<BR>December 15, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United States embassy in Maputo confirmed that they have banned a<BR>U.S. journalist, Joseph Hanlon, from speaking to the ambassador and any<BR>of his staff regarding Mozambique. Ambassador Dennis Jett, told MISA on<BR>December 15 saying: &quot;Hanlon is an unprofessional journalist whose<BR>reporting is totally and consistently biased. It is a waste of time<BR>talking to him.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hanlon is author of several books which focus on Mozambique. He also<BR>edited the &quot;Peace Process Bulletin&quot;, put out by AWEPA (Association of<BR>European Parliamentarians for Southern Africa). In recent years, Hanlon<BR>covered, in detail, implementation of the 1992 peace accord between the<BR>government and the Renamo 'rebels'. And according to the Mozambique<BR>Information Agency (AIM), these credentials make Hanlon the best<BR>informed U.S. journalist on Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIM reported on November 6,1995 that Hanlon requested, as he had done<BR>many times before, interviews with the U.S. embassy staff but press<BR>attach=E9 Adrienne O'Neal told him that nobody had any time to talk to<BR>him. &quot;I informed her that the embassy has been talking to me for the<BR>past 15 years&quot;, Hanlon told AIM. On October 25, AIM reported, Hanlon<BR>spoke to O'Neal again but she replied: &quot;I have talked to people here in<BR>the embassy and explained your concern and they say that nobody in the<BR>US embassy or at USAID will have time to talk to you&quot;. AIM reported that<BR>when Hanlon asked why this ban had been put on him, O'Neal is quoted as<BR>saying she did not have to give any reasons. But she is further quoted<BR>as having added: &quot;There is a history to this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIM reported that Hanlon had never had any problem in speaking to US<BR>officials during the pacification and election periods, even though what<BR>he wrote was frequently critical of US policy towards Mozambique. Hanlon<BR>said he did not understand the embassy's sudden change of the attitude.<BR>&quot;Had the Mozambican government done this to me, the American embassy<BR>would have raised hell, and claimed that freedom of the press was under<BR>threat,&quot; Hanlon is quoted as saying. And added: &quot;For a country that<BR>supposedly believes in freedom of information, the embassy's position is<BR>grotesque,&quot; and added, &quot;it will be interesting to see whether the<BR>embassy's flagrant denial of freedom of information will figure in the<BR>next U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Mozambique.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Ambassador Jett argued that although the embassy has banned<BR>Hanlon, the action does not affect freedom of press. &quot;The government<BR>will not prevent journalists investigating their findings. But if the<BR>government doesn't want to talk to you, you can't force them to. It is<BR>my choice to take up questions,&quot; Ambassador Jett said. He further said<BR>that he talked to Hanlon extensively in the past, but he finds &quot;his<BR>information in the books not good. Hanlon is hopelessly biased.&quot;</SPAN></P>

You also made the point, however, that as ambassador, I<BR>did not have the right to ban anyone in the embassy from speaking to a<BR>journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When it comes to expressing official government opinions during<BR>official working hours -- which is what Mr. Hanlon requested -- I not<BR>only have the right, but the obligation to ensure that official<BR>positions are expressed coherently and consistently. I also have the<BR>obligation to the taxpayers of the United States to see that their money<BR>is not wasted. We have spent many hours in the past answering Mr.<BR>Hanlon's questions, which failed to improve the quality of his<BR>reporting. Using more time of embassy personnel to respond to more of<BR>Mr. Hanlon's questions, given his ideological orientation and lack of<BR>objectivity, would therefore be a waste of such resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Would the distinguished editor of MediaFax have his readers believe<BR>that any journalist has the right to ask any question of any employee of<BR>any organization at any time and that no one in a position of authority,<BR>be it a manager, minister or ambassador, has the right to determine<BR>whether or how the question will be answered? If that is the case,<BR>Article 27 of law 18/91, which lists the rights of journalists, fails to<BR>include such a right and nowhere else in that law or in the constitution<BR>is such a right described.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe this is more than just a case of not understanding the<BR>letter of the law; it is also a fundamental lack of comprehension of the<BR>spirit of the law. This lack of understanding is not limited to this one<BR>occasion. When the Embassy's press attache wrote you in November<BR>regarding Mr. Hanlon, you took offense at her suggestion that an entity<BR>of the government like AIM perhaps doesn't understand freedom of the<BR>press. You termed this an insult to you and the other journalists who<BR>had worked at AIM and you pointed out &quot;AIM journalists had to continue<BR>to struggle a great deal for this press freedom, sometimes without<BR>success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While you may have struggled, I would agree that you did not succeed.<BR>When you were director of AIM, Renamo was never mentioned by name, but<BR>was always referred to as the &quot;armed bandits.&quot; Today AIM only describes<BR>Renamo as &quot;the former rebel movement.&quot; It never calls Renamo &quot;the<BR>largest opposition political party&quot; or even &quot;an opposition party.&quot;<BR>Frelimo, on the other hand, is always referred to as the &quot;ruling party&quot;<BR>or the &quot;governing party&quot; which is an accurate description of the present<BR>without reference to the past. Do AIM's readers need to be reminded<BR>every day that Renamo was once a rebel movement? If it is AIM's<BR>intention to teach history, in view of its successful struggle for<BR>liberation from colonialism, why isn't Frelimo ever referred to as a<BR>&quot;former rebel movement?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This problem with nomenclature is perhaps a small example of bias,<BR>but I am not the only one who doubts AIM's impartiality. The following<BR>quote regarding AIM may interest you: &quot;the service, however, causes some<BR>controversy, as many professionals are of the opinion that it is a<BR>service of governmental propaganda instead of being an information<BR>service with independence and objectivity guaranteed by law.&quot; The quote<BR>is from an article on page 5 of the August 28, 1995 issue of &quot;Savana,&quot;<BR>an excellent newspaper that I recommend you read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some would argue that it is pointless to enter into a debate about<BR>freedom of press with those who do not understand it or choose to ignore<BR>the values that are its foundation. Others say that arguing with an<BR>editor is a no-win situation since he (or she) will always have the last<BR>word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While I do not disagree with these arguments, I think it is an<BR>important debate nonetheless because the peace which Mozambique now<BR>enjoys is by no means assured. One academic study which I read recently<BR>concluded that during the last fifty years in countries where there had<BR>been civil wars that were ended through negotiation, in one half of them<BR>war broke out again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether Mozambique is part of the half that succeeds in not repeating<BR>the tragedy of the past will depend, to a large degree, on whether<BR>democracy succeeds here. Democracy can function successfully only if the<BR>institutions that are its foundations can function. In addition to a<BR>strong legislature and an independent judiciary, a free press is one of<BR>those essential institutions. Can the press be free if it is owned by<BR>the government? Is AIM your argument that it can? As the editor of the<BR>oldest independent publication in Mozambique, your opinions in this<BR>regard should be taken seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When reading the accounts of those who worked for two years to<BR>negotiate the General Peace Agreement in Rome, one theme is consistent.<BR>The mutual lack of confidence that the two parties had in each other<BR>repeatedly complicated the process. The climate created by a biased and<BR>unobjective press clearly contributed to this mutual lack of trust. The<BR>role played by the press therefore probably served to prolong the war<BR>and certainly served to make implementation of the peace more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Distinguished editor of Mediafax, perhaps you should spend less time<BR>complaining about your friend being denied an interview and more time<BR>worrying about the threat to continued peace in Mozambique posed by some<BR>of those who practice your profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since article 33 of law 18/91 describes the right to reply, I trust<BR>you will not violate my rights and will publish this letter in its<BR>entirety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Along with the hope that the New Year brings greater understanding of<BR>and appreciation for freedom of the press and freedom of expression,<BR>please accept assurances of my highest consideration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statement by the Media Institute of South African (MISA), December<BR>15, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United States embassy in Maputo confirmed that they have banned a<BR>U.S. journalist, Joseph Hanlon, from speaking to the ambassador and any<BR>of his staff regarding Mozambique. Ambassador Dennis Jett, told MISA on<BR>December 15 saying: &quot;Hanlon is an unprofessional journalist whose<BR>reporting is totally and consistently biased. It is a waste of time<BR>talking to him.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hanlon is author of several books which focus on Mozambique. He also<BR>edited the &quot;Peace Process Bulletin&quot;, put out by AWEPA (Association of<BR>European Parliamentarians for Southern Africa). In recent years, Hanlon<BR>covered, in detail, implementation of the 1992 peace accord between the<BR>government and the Renamo 'rebels'. And according to the Mozambique<BR>Information Agency (AIM), these credentials make Hanlon the best<BR>informed U.S. journalist on Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIM reported on November 6,1995 that Hanlon requested, as he had done<BR>many times before, interviews with the U.S. embassy staff but press<BR>attach=E9 Adrienne O'Neal told him that nobody had any time to talk to<BR>him. &quot;I informed her that the embassy has been talking to me for the<BR>past 15 years&quot;, Hanlon told AIM. On October 25, AIM reported, Hanlon<BR>spoke to O'Neal again but she replied: &quot;I have talked to people here in<BR>the embassy and explained your concern and they say that nobody in the<BR>US embassy or at USAID will have time to talk to you&quot;. AIM reported that<BR>when Hanlon asked why this ban had been put on him, O'Neal is quoted as<BR>saying she did not have to give any reasons. But she is further quoted<BR>as having added: &quot;There is a history to this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIM reported that Hanlon had never had any problem in speaking to US<BR>officials during the pacification and election periods, even though what<BR>he wrote was frequently critical of US policy towards Mozambique. Hanlon<BR>said he did not understand the embassy's sudden change of the attitude.<BR>&quot;Had the Mozambican government done this to me, the American embassy<BR>would have raised hell, and claimed that freedom of the press was under<BR>threat,&quot; Hanlon is quoted as saying. And added: &quot;For a country that<BR>supposedly believes in freedom of information, the embassy's position is<BR>grotesque,&quot; and added, &quot;it will be interesting to see whether the<BR>embassy's flagrant denial of freedom of information will figure in the<BR>next U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Mozambique.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Ambassador Jett argued that although the embassy has banned<BR>Hanlon, the action does not affect freedom of press. &quot;The government<BR>will not prevent journalists investigating their findings. But if the<BR>government doesn't want to talk to you, you can't force them to. It is<BR>my choice to take up questions,&quot; Ambassador Jett said. He further said<BR>that he talked to Hanlon extensively in the past, but he finds &quot;his<BR>information in the books not good. Hanlon is hopelessly biased.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Opposition Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) on Tuesday<BR>challenged President Frederick Chiluba in an open letter to explain<BR>where the taxpayer's money was going as most services government claimed<BR>to be providing were donor funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The LPF letter claimed money from taxes was not being spent on things<BR>the majority of the people were crying for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Government is not feeding the vulnerable groups,&quot; LPF claimed in its<BR>open letter to the President of Monday. &quot;Donors are.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LPF further charged that government was not supplying medicines in<BR>hospitals as the drug kits too came from donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But neither State House nor the finance ministry or Ministry of<BR>Health wasprepared to respond to LPF's charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think the issue is really a ministry of finance one so you should<BR>try MrPenza,&quot; said President Chiluba's public relations and press aide,<BR>Richard Sakala, in an interview yesterday. &quot; I don't want to answer it<BR>in general terms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And health minister Michael Sata was also not in a position to defend<BR>hisministry, or the President, over the supply of medicines to<BR>hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the letter was addressed to me I would have commented but since<BR>it wasaddressed to the President I cant comment,&quot; Sata said in an<BR>interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And finance minister Ronald Penza and deputies could not be reached<BR>for comment as they were locked in a budget meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LPF accused government of not providing services that matched up to<BR>the value of taxes collected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Government has not released money promised for maintenance from the<BR>Road Fund, despite fuel levies being increased in 1995,&quot; LPF's open<BR>letter to the President read, adding: &quot;Government supplies of books and<BR>desks to schools have tickled to a halt. Government has not invested in<BR>water supply since the donors finished their drought relief programs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LPF advised President Chiluba to take advantage of his address at the<BR>opening of Parliament on Friday to restore hope to the people of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We urge you to address how your government will reduce and re-target<BR>publicexpenditure in order to deliver the goods and services and what<BR>measures thegovernment will put in place to revive the economy and<BR>achieve growth in 1996,&quot; LPF urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LPF claimed there was ample evidence of &quot;flagrant extravagance in<BR>higher levels of government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;New cars, new offices, new furniture, and trips overseas,&quot; the<BR>letter stated. &quot;Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) has confirmed that there<BR>is no shortage of money. In fact ZRA collected more money than budgeted<BR>for in 1995.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulenga, said the exercise which had picked up towards the close of<BR>the initial deadline is now slowing down again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Seventy five per cent of Zambia's annual budget and<BR>development projects was donor funded in 1995, Finance Minister Ronald<BR>Penza disclosed in an interview yesterday in Chisamba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penza said only 25 per cent was contributed to the overall budget by<BR>the taxpayer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's my intention to run Zambia at a profit but we have 70 per cent<BR>of theinvestment being foreign while 75 per cent of the so called budget<BR>is provided for by the donors, &quot; Penza said. &quot;It will take another 15<BR>years to get out of the current debts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And debt repayment obligations have also compounded Penza's<BR>headaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's unfortunate that the $1.3 billion we got from the donors will<BR>only be used to repay debts,&quot; Penza carped. &quot;We will have to repay at 0.<BR>05 per cent interest over a period of five and half years since now our<BR>credit worthiness is more enhanced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And this week opposition Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) challenged<BR>in an open letter to the President for the government to explain where<BR>it was taking the money from tax collections since almost everything in<BR>the country is donor funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Penza dismissed LPF's charges saying understanding of economics<BR>seemed to be a problem in the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Twenty five per cent of Zambia's money went to the budget and<BR>Chongwe (LPFpresident) does not understand economics,&quot; Penza said. &quot; He<BR>is just politicking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bloemfontein - A serious mood engulfed the Zambian squad as they<BR>prepared for tomorrow's clash against Burkina Faso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation was further compounded after Algeria took over the<BR>leadership of Group B when they beat Sierra Leone 2-0 last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coach Roald Poulsen last night drilled his army in a gruelling two<BR>hours training session under floodlights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poulsen's emphasis was to make sure his players got used to playing<BR>under the floodlights. Zambia's two remaining preliminaries have been<BR>slated at 20.00 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Poulsen said he was not worried about Zambia playing their two<BR>remaining preliminary matches under flood lights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is definitely no problem,&quot; Poulsen on Wednesday night adding<BR>&quot;There is no difference playing under flood lights or during the day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Poulsen, playing at night was a blessing in disguise<BR>because the temperatures here were stifling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You cannot expect the players to play soccer in temperatures in the<BR>region of 32 degrees centigrade. Naturally the heat will inhibit and<BR>stifle their type of play,&quot; Poulsen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he admitted that it would have been better had the games been<BR>played during the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In Zambia, we play soccer during the day. But the boys are adapting<BR>well and looking forward to the games,&quot; Poulsen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Camp manager Solly Pandor agreed. &quot;I wouldn't say playing under flood<BR>lights is an advantage or disadvantage. But the morale in the camp is<BR>very high. There are no injuries and the boys are raring to go,&quot; Pandor<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So determined and sharp were the players in their workout that one<BR>Burkinabe journalist remarked; &quot;Our boys are in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bloemfontein - South Africa's soccer boss, Solomon &quot;Stix&quot; Morewa has<BR>expressed worry at the poor crowds attending the on-going Africa Cup of<BR>Nations games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Briefing pressmen and women on Tuesday, Morewa said the situation was<BR>getting out of hand and would meet Confederation of Africa Football<BR>(CAF) officials this week with the aim of reviewing gate charges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unreserved seats have been priced at R25 while reserved seats are<BR>going for R30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poor crowds were seen during the Zambia versus Algeria and Sierra<BR>Leone versus Burkina Faso matches here in Bloemfontein and also during a<BR>night game on Monday at the giant FNB stadium where fewer than 2,000<BR>people watched the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The poor attendence is worrying us. We are to hold meetings with CAF<BR>to review the situation,&quot; said Morewa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, chairman of the organising committee here in Bloemfontein,<BR>Veli Mahlangu, has appealed to influntial local leaders to draw the<BR>attention of the community to the Africa Cup of Nations games being<BR>played at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein.+++His appeal comes in<BR>the wake of the poor crowds that attended the two matches so far played<BR>in Bloemfontein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is very sad,&quot; said Mahlangu during a cocktail party hosted by<BR>Bloemfontein mayor, Jani Mohapi, in honour of the four competing teams<BR>and CAF officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We accept that African teams are mainly a foreign entity to our<BR>fans,&quot; Mahlangu said. &quot;But we had hoped local fans would appreciate the<BR>chance if seeing the teams in action and therefore support their games.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some Bloemfontein residents interviewed say they are boycotting<BR>the games because of the exclusion of Bloemfontein-born local starand<BR>1995 national soccer league Player of the Year, David &quot;Lesilo&quot; Modise to<BR>the South African national team.</SPAN></P>

Project Chief technical Advisor, Wendy Fitzgerald, said in an<BR>interview yesterday the programme will start on February 5, and run for<BR>a year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have budgeted $240, 000 for 1996 programmes and we hope to run<BR>about 8 short courses in various areas in small scale businesses,&quot; said<BR>Fiztgerald.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Chiluba's position on the method of adopting the<BR>constitution has nothing to do with respect for the sovereignty of<BR>Parliament but much with fear of losing power if clauses that level the<BR>play field and broaden political competition are put in the<BR>constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President's fear of losing the benefits of power, and not of the<BR>opportunity to help create a better Zambia for all, was made very clear<BR>at last month's MMD's extraordinary convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President reminded his government officials of the deprivations<BR>they will have to endure if he and the MMD were voted out. He reminded<BR>them of the houses, the cars and offices they will lose. But he failed<BR>to acknow-ladge that he will be the greatest loser as he is the highest<BR>beneficiary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is what worries President Chiluba. This is what seems to propel<BR>him in all that he does. But the disastrous endings of people who pursue<BR>the goals of vanity in the world are many. And President Chiluba is<BR>pushing this country on that path. I beg all men and women of goodwill<BR>to go down on their knees to beg President Chiluba not to drag our<BR>country into chaos. A constitution that is not accepted and respected by<BR>a large section of society is a recipe for bloodshed. The President and<BR>his people, as defence minister Ben Mwila once remarked, have<BR>accumulated enough money to go and live abroad comfortably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government seems to be running out of arguments to justify its<BR>refusal to adopt the Constitution through a constituent assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening the fifth session of the seventh National Assembly, President<BR>Frederick Chiluba warned that the government will not bow to pressure<BR>from some elements with axes to grind to adopt the constitution through<BR>a constituent assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President also cautioned that any other procedures dictated to by<BR>disgruntled elements would only entail the law of the jungle. This type<BR>of language is very familiar to most Zambians. It is not different to<BR>former president Kenneth Kaunda's language during the Second Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But I fail to appreciate the link between one being disgruntled with<BR>President Chiluba and the method of adopting the constitution. What is<BR>personal about the Constitution? Can any reasonable person really<BR>personalise a Constitution? Is the Constitution of the Republic of<BR>Zambia a personal property of the President and his friends in the MMD<BR>club, which they can resolve to disband tomorrow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Can a citizen's rights be measured on the basis of his or her<BR>disposition towards those in power? The plural society Zambians ushered<BR>in 1991 had at its core, the empowerment of those with axes to grind<BR>them and the disgruntled to be disgruntled. Dissent is a constitutional<BR>right that must be scrupulously respected. President Chiluba was at one<BR>time a 'disgruntled' person with 'an axe to grind' with former president<BR>Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Constitution will, and should, not be an exclusive product of the<BR>friends and supporters of a president. It should be a product of all<BR>Zambians - whether friends and foes of President Chiluba. This is the<BR>depth to which the President has sunk the constitutional debate! And<BR>this being the case it is understandable why the 'disgruntled' and the<BR>'axe grinders' are not comfortable with President Chiluba's method of<BR>adopting the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The more President Chiluba opens his mouth over the Constitution the<BR>more I am convinced he is not being honest and forthright with the<BR>Zambian people. The President's argument that a constituent assembly<BR>takes away the powers of Parliament is not very convincing when the<BR>Constitution of the Republic of Zambia provides for a referendum<BR>whenever there are any amendments to the Bill of Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Constitutional Review Commission had proposed an extension of the<BR>Bill of Rights, in line with the MMD manifesto of 1991, which would have<BR>required subjecting the Constitution to a referendum. But President<BR>Chiluba, it appears, is not prepared to have anyone outside his control<BR>have any significant influence on the constitution, and he consequently<BR>got rid of all the proposed amendments to the Bill of Rights, in order<BR>to stay clear of a referendum, even if this meant breaking a written<BR>election promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1991 MMD manifesto, on which President Chiluba claims he was<BR>elected, on page 3 promised: &quot;The MMD is committed to extending the Bill<BR>of Rights to embrace categories such as the rights of the press and<BR>children and rights against all forms of discriminations against women.<BR>The MMD will uphold the Bill of Right with all its power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this is not the only promise that has been expediently abandoned.<BR>The MMD promised not to subordinate the rights of the minority to that<BR>of the majority. But today, over the constitution, the MMD wants to use<BR>its parliamentary majority to subject all Zambians, even those who are<BR>not members of the MMD, to a party constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD manifesto on page 11 promised: &quot;The MMD upholds the<BR>democratic principles such as ... non-subordinations of the minority to<BR>the majority and the right of the minority to defend its interests<BR>publicly if their interests are threatened.&quot; The Munyama Human Rights<BR>Commission, in its report, politely noted the party's departure from<BR>this position. But what is much more worrying with the commission's<BR>observations is that the MMD has negated on the extension of the Bill of<BR>Rights when there are concerns that the courts are not doing much to<BR>advance liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The judiciary was accused of being too timid and passing judgments<BR>that favoured the government, and were against the civil liberties of<BR>individuals,&quot; reads the Munyama Human Rights Commission report, adding:<BR>&quot;It was then argued that fighting human rights cases in court was an<BR>exercise in futility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And even Nelson Mandela, a law-abiding attorney whose desire for the<BR>freedom of his people to live in dignity drove him to become a criminal,<BR>turned this family-loving husband into a man without a home, forced this<BR>life-loving man to live like a monk for more than a quarter of a<BR>century in jail, when his 'hour' won, he did not want to single-handedly<BR>write a constitution of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his book, &quot;Long Walk to Freedom&quot;, on page 743 Mandela writes: &quot;We<BR>polled 62.6 per cent of national vote, slightly short of the two-thirds<BR>needed had we wished to push through a final constitution without<BR>support from other parties. Some in the ANC were disappointed that we<BR>did not cross the two-thirds threshold, but I was not one of them. In<BR>fact I was relieved; had we won two-thirds of the vote and been able to<BR>write a constitution unfettered by input from others, people would argue<BR>that we had created an ANC constitution, not a South African<BR>constitution. I wanted a true government of national unity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bloemfontein - Games being played at the Africa Cup of Nations in<BR>South Africa have been declared as drug free, ten days before the close<BR>of the competition. Organising committee chairman Dr Peter Matsheke<BR>said on Friday in a press statement: &quot;So far all players have been<BR>clean.&quot; He explained that each of the four venues has a centre where the<BR>tests are being carried.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At half time, the match commissioners and team officials of the two<BR>competing teams randomly select two players from each team by drawing<BR>two numbers per team out of a bag,&quot; Dr Matsheke said, adding: &quot;The<BR>players are identified 15 minutes from the centre by their team<BR>officials and doctors where the taking of samples is administered by a<BR>CAF appointed doctor.&quot; According to Dr. Matsheke, the players are<BR>allowed to choose the containers for their samples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These containers are coded and only the secretary general of CAF,<BR>Mustapha Fahmy, knows the identities of the players when he receives the<BR>results between 36 and 48 hours after the tests are carried out,&quot;<BR>explained Dr. Matsheke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The samples are being tested at the University of Bloemfontein which<BR>according to Dr. Matsheke &quot;is the only international Olympics committee<BR>(IOC) accredited laboratory in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During Zambia's game against Algeria, Zeddy Saileti and Harrison<BR>Chongo were picked for testing and have since been cleared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Zambia could still get in the quarter-finals with one<BR>point from the tie against Sierra Leone on Wednesday night in the Group<BR>B Africa Cup of Naions finals here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But no such thought is being entertained by coach Roald Poulsen or<BR>his 22- man squad who says no chances were going to be taken and his<BR>players were going to go for the kill to top the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our aim is to win and end at the top of the group,&quot;declared Poulsen.<BR>&quot;We will put all our energies into the game.&quot; He added: &quot;The boys know<BR>what is at stake. They will go out for an outright win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Combative winger, Jonson Bwalya agreed.  &quot; Our aim is to beat Sierra<BR>Leone convincingly so that we top the table in group B and stay in<BR>Bloemfontein,&quot; he said. &quot;Sierra Leone is a good team. we have to respect<BR>them,&quot; warned Jonson. But team captain Kalusha Bwalya is confident his<BR>boys will pull off a win . &quot;The boys are keyed up after the Burkina Faso<BR>match and are more determined than ever to make sure of a place in the<BR>last eight,&quot; Great Kalu said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's breath taking 5-1 win over Burkina Faso on Saturday night<BR>meant that they are now heading group B on goal difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scoreline was too much for the Burkinabe that coach, Idrissa<BR>Traore refused to attend the mandatory mixed post match press<BR>conference. But nearly everyone here in Bloemfontein is full of praise<BR>for the Zambian team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Aston Villa and Wimbledon stirker John Fashanu had this to<BR>say: &quot; This is the best team performance so far. Kulusha led by<BR>example, it makes me feel at 33 I am not too old to play soccer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Much has been said about Uganda rising from ruins to become<BR>a showcase of a positive economic recovery programme.  But nonthis East African country for its overall statistical progress, should<BR>governmental organisations here say the same donors who are praising<BR>now pressurize the government to address itself to the plight of<BR>millions of ordinary Ugandans who are wallowing in poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Residents of Kyotera town some 160 km south of Uganda's capital,<BR>Kampala held their breath as tens of military tanks rumbled through<BR>their dusty town, wrecking the just tarmacked section of a highway that<BR>leads into neighbouring Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Military authorities say that some 84 tanks were imported through<BR>Tanzania last November, a sign of increasing scale of Ugandan armament<BR>programme which is worrying donors who now say the programme accounts<BR>for more than 30 per cent of the country's budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The collision course between Ugandan government and the donors over<BR>defence is not very difficult to discern.  The government explains that<BR>security needs are back on the high table because the country feels<BR>besieged by hostile neighbours.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Yoweri Museveni recently said that there are only two<BR>countries in the region he is on talking terms with -- Rwanda and<BR>Tanzania.  He suspects that other countries harbour rebel groups bent on<BR>destabilising Uganda.  &quot;These countries fear a repeat of the type of<BR>revolution that happened in Uganda in their countries,&quot; Museveni has<BR>been quoted saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also believes that beefed up security also guarantees the welfare<BR>of investors.  To date, Uganda's Investment Authority has recorded<BR>nearly US dollars 2.5 billion but only 10 per cent of the amount has<BR>been actually invested in the country.  Among the reasons given for<BR>holding back is the uncertainty of this East African country's political<BR>situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda has however assured &quot;doubting Thomases&quot; that her<BR>demobilisation programme would result in a decline in defence spending.<BR>When the National Resistance Movement (NRM) took power in 1986, it built<BR>up a force of nearly 130,000 soldiers.  Then, the government reasoned<BR>that it had many enemies to fight. At one time 14 rebel groups were<BR>operating in the country.  Thus the high defence spending was tolerated.<BR>And as the number of rebel groups was scaled down and the government<BR>started demobilising its troops, there was a sigh of relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The troops were reduced down to 50,000 and correspondingly defence<BR>spending went down.  According to the latest parliamentary report<BR>covering the 94/95 financial year, defence spending had dropped to 8 per<BR>cent of the national budget.  But then it is picking up again and<BR>according to latest figures from the United Nations Children's Fund<BR>(UNICEF), spending on defence has gone back to 30 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the government says there is need to modernise the army.  Mr.<BR>Amama Mbabazi, Uganda's Defence Minister is of the opinion that the army<BR>is now faced with well armed rebels and therefore needs to improve its<BR>efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He notes that the country has to be guarded against external threat,<BR>especially from Sudan where both former President Idi Amin's soldiers<BR>under the West Nile Bank Front and Joseph Kony's rebel Lord Resistance<BR>Army (LRA) are based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But many concerned Ugandans believe defence is eating up resources<BR>which would otherwise have gone to the improvement of the people's<BR>welfare.  Both donors and non-governmental organisation are also worried<BR>about the trend in a country whose population is increasingly wallowing<BR>in poverty and disease, and want donors to do something about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a poverty alleviation conference held last November in Uganda, the<BR>NGOs said that some form of pressure ought to be put on the government<BR>so that it responds to the needs of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Ugandan government should be made to accept highest social<BR>conditionalities in form of higher budget allocation in health and<BR>education,&quot; Gary Bercker, one of the resource persons at the meeting<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that out of the country's 18 million people, 13 million live<BR>below the poverty line.  About 76 per cent of the 2.2 million pupils who<BR>enter primary schools do not complete seven years of education and only<BR>three per cent make it to university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Bercker said donors can prevail upon the government to address<BR>the increasing levels of poverty in the country.  &quot;Poverty reduction is<BR>still an after-thought and not an integral part of the government policy<BR>formulation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bercker's concern is shared by the 1400 NGOs operating in Uganda.<BR>They say there are many intangible causes of insecurity in the country,<BR>especially when the population is dissatisfied with what they get from<BR>the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NGOs, most of whom interact with one another and with the people,<BR>have proved to be spokespersons for the population.  They have served as<BR>an alternative to the government in availing the much needed services, a<BR>quality that puts them in a better position to understand what are<BR>likely to be causes of social conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Social disruptions and discontent have increasingly been demonstrated<BR>through industrial strikes, especially by government workers.  Most<BR>dramatic was the strike by doctors who felt that their demand for better<BR>pay among other conditions has not been met.  Railway workers and<BR>teachers too have expressed their grievances through similar<BR>demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government should look into the issue of equity which requires<BR>that the distribution of benefits from growth must be addressed, if the<BR>poor are not to be further marginalised,&quot; Dr. Fred Opio, the Makerere<BR>University Executive Director for Economic Policy Research said.  His<BR>concern was that the government is yet to show commitment to the plight<BR>of the poor at a time when there are increasingly huge sums of money<BR>saved from the ongoing economic reform programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statistical bulletin released by the Ministry of Finance in June<BR>1995 says Uganda saved up to US dollars 100 million in programmes such<BR>as the retrenchment of 148,000 civil servants.  The publication also<BR>notes that the privatisation programme allowed the country to collect<BR>nearly US dollars 90 million through privatisation receipts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was hoped that this money would be utilised in the improvement of<BR>much needed services.  For instance, the World Bank says that the Uganda<BR>Electricity Board (UEB) is in great financial distress.  The board needs<BR>US dollars 100 million annually to be able to extend its services to the<BR>different areas of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then, this should have been possible if the monies saved from the<BR>privatisation were applied to improve these services.  But when the<BR>report on privatisation was read, it was discovered that some of the<BR>money has been lent to private investors who have bought some of the<BR>companies, much to the annoyance of the parliamentarians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless the government says that it has embarked on four<BR>measures to improve public resource expenditure.  The Minister for<BR>Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Joash Mayanja Nkangi says<BR>the government has already established a medium term expenditure<BR>framework where all sectors are involved in preparation of the budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says the application of these measures will see the budget share<BR>of the health sector rise from the current 12.1 to 15.4 per cent in the<BR>next financial year (96/97) while that of education will move from 17.9<BR>to 22.6 per cent in the same period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also points out that the government has redesigned its priority<BR>programmes to serve as many people as possible.  &quot;Before 1991, health<BR>expenditure skewed towards high cost hospital services that tended to<BR>benefit the few, while education was skewed towards secondary and<BR>tertiary institutions,&quot; he explained.  Now special attention will be<BR>paid to primary health care, rural water supply and primary education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although these measures have taken hold, it would be long before<BR>tangible improvements are seen.  For instance, the per capita<BR>expenditure on health has risen to only US dollars 8 while the accepted<BR>standard is US dollars 12.  So far NGOs feel that pressure has to be put<BR>on the government so that it does not backslide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And their prayers were partly answered when donors asked the<BR>government to use money saved from relief programmes in the social<BR>sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A debt management programme drawn by experts from the Bank of Uganda<BR>and an international team of experts from the newly created Eastern and<BR>Southern African Initiative in Debt and Reserves Management (ESAIDARM),<BR>World Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development<BR>(UNCTAD) introduced two new components in the debt management programme.<BR>Through the programme, up to US dollars 20 million of the debt will be<BR>converted into local currency and be invested in social and<BR>environmental sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, donors have agreed to establish a multi-lateral<BR>debt fund where donors will avail unspecified balance of payment support<BR>to the government to offset amounts owed to multilateral institutions<BR>like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and African<BR>Development Bank (ADB).  The fund which is being supported by Denmark,<BR>Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland among others, will release more<BR>funds to the social sector instead of having the same directed to<BR>servicing the external debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to government estimates, multilateral debt servicing<BR>accounts for up to 30 per cent of the national budget.  But it is<BR>expected that the new measures will reduce this by half to between 11<BR>and 12 per cent annually.  To ensure that the Ugandan government follows<BR>the plan, donors are expected to review the debt programme on a<BR>quarterly basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then, this is only part of the answer.  There are strong feelings<BR>especially in Uganda, among government opponents that the authorities in<BR>Kampala need to be more reconciliatory to neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was wrong to sever diplomatic relationship with Sudan for this<BR>closed all avenues towards peaceful resolution of the conflict,&quot; said<BR>Mr. Paul Kawanga Semogerere, an aspiring presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This subject also elicits some form of sympathy among senior<BR>government officials.  Mrs Betty Bigombe, the Minister in charge of<BR>Pacification of the north said that when all is said and done,<BR>negotiations are still part of the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is very difficult to police our long stretch of the border we<BR>share with Sudan, thus it may be through negotiations that peace can be<BR>achieved,&quot; she emphasised.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda - After two-months break in the Angolan peace process, coupled<BR>with several incidents of ceasefire violations, the Angolan government<BR>and UNITA rebels have taken a major step forward with an agreement on<BR>the new composition of the army and the encampment of their excess<BR>guerrilla forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 26,000 soldiers of the former rebel Union for the Total<BR>Independence of Angola (UNITA) movement will be integrated into a new<BR>Angolan defence force of some 90,000 men.  Of the 63,000 ex- guerrillas<BR>in Jonas Savimbi's UNITA, 26,000 will join the new army, 200 the air<BR>force and 100 the navy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The figure, announced in the Angolan capital, Luanda on January 15,<BR>was decided on at meetings in the past week between members of the<BR>general staff of UNITA and the regular armed forces of President Jose<BR>Eduardo dos Santos' ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of<BR>Angola (MPLA) government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both UNITA and MPLA, protagonists in Angola's civil war for almost<BR>two decades since independence from Portugal in 1975, agreed that other<BR>soldiers in their ranks -- some 180,000 men -- will not be demobilised<BR>immediately but assigned to a new force responsible for rebuilding<BR>civilian and military infrastructure destroyed during the bitter<BR>conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNITA fighters named to the new defence force in line with a<BR>peace pact signed in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994, will be selected<BR>once all the former rebels have been disarmed and encamped in 15 sites<BR>prepared for them under the United Nations' supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Negotiations on the structure of the future army and the distribution<BR>of posts will continue.  The Luanda government has offered UNITA six<BR>places on the general staff of the defence force, including that of<BR>deputy chief-of-staff, a government source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNITA representative on the joint peace commission established<BR>with the government, Isaias Samakuva, on January 15 went to Bailundo,<BR>the movement's headquarters town in central Angola, to consult with<BR>Savimbi on Luanda's proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resumption of military talks is expected to lead to progress in<BR>the encampment operation, although no timetable has been fixed.  &quot;We are<BR>not yet in a position to confirm the beginning of this operation,&quot; a<BR>UNITA delegation member said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 12, UNITA declared that it will free all prisoners of war<BR>(POWs) it is still holding, a joint commission for verifying peace in<BR>the southern African state said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release of the POWs -- both military and civilian -- was due to<BR>be supervised from this week by the International Committee of the Red<BR>Cross, (ICRC) sources said, but did not give the exact number involved.<BR>The government has so far released 341 prisoners, while UNITA has freed<BR>20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A timetable aimed at putting the Angola peace effort back on a firm<BR>track was reached &quot;formally&quot; at a meeting on January 12 between<BR>representatives of the rebel group and the joint commission.  It<BR>requires</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNITA to bring back to their bases its combatants in three locations<BR>-- Negage and Quibaze, both in the north, and Londiibali, in the centre<BR>of the country -- by January 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government, meanwhile, is to remove its troops to barracks in<BR>Uije and Bengo provinces, both in the north, according to the timetable<BR>which was proposed by the UN Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talks had gone on hold after clashes between fighters from both<BR>sides in the north, threatening the success of a peace plan signed in<BR>November 1994.  UN sources in Luanda said a list of UNITA officials who<BR>would be part of a new Angolan government of national unity would be<BR>discussed at the next meeting between President dos Santos and the UNITA<BR>leader Jonas Savimbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations did not say when the meeting would take place, but<BR>Angolan radio said it could be held before January 20.  Since the Lusaka<BR>peace accord was signed in 1994, UNITA and MPLA have met three times in<BR>Zambia, Gabon and Belgium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the Lusaka peace accord, which ended 20 years of civil war in<BR>the sprawling former Portuguese colony, the Ministers of Geology and<BR>Mines, Trade, Health and Tourism are to be UNITA officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also reserved for the rebel group are seven vice-ministerial<BR>positions, including Defence, Interior, Finance and Agriculture, plus<BR>three provincial governorships and six ambassadorial posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former rivals are also due to discuss the repatriation of<BR>mercenaries they employed during the war.  Last week, the government<BR>sent home 460 South Africans who had been fighting on its side, but<BR>UNITA claims that Luanda had employed a total of 5,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move forward in the peace process comes as the head of the UN<BR>Security Council sought to boost the peace process in Angola by urging<BR>President dos Santos and the UNITA opposition leader to meet soon<BR>without conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I appeal strongly to you to build upon progress made in negotiations<BR>in the past few days and to do everything necessary to resolve the<BR>outstanding issues which are blocking the peace process in Angola,&quot;<BR>Britain's Sir John Weston wrote on behalf of the 15-member council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council expressed &quot;serious concern about reports of continued<BR>violations of the ceasefire&quot; as well as slow progress on practical<BR>implementation of obligations of peace agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council said it was expecting a response from the two men via<BR>United States ambassador to the Untied Nations Madeleine Albright who<BR>was about to set out on a visit to Africa.  That response as well as<BR>concrete actions will be &quot;critical factors&quot; as the council considers the<BR>possible renewal of the 6,400-man UN mission next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 4, 50 people were killed in southern Angola during a dawn<BR>attack by rebels from the UNITA movement, the governor of the province<BR>of Huila Kundi Payama announced in a statement carried by the official<BR>Angolan News Agency (ANGOP) monitored in Lisbon the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the statement, Kundi said that an unknown number of rebels from<BR>UNITA took part in the attack on the town of Chivulo, located in Huila<BR>province, where the military situation had escalated in recent weeks<BR>following the return to the area of a UNITA leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incident came just as the Angolan government and former rebel<BR>leaders from the UNITA movement resumed negotiations a day earlier on<BR>setting up a national army in line with the November 1994 Lusaka peace<BR>accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talks resumed following an emergency meeting in Luanda on January<BR>2 between UN special envoy to Angola Alioune Blondin Beye and<BR>representatives from the government and UNITA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN officials said that during the meeting, the UN also denounced the<BR>Angolan government for allowing one of the army units to capture the<BR>town of Kitoke in Uije province during the Christmas holidays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incident neither claimed any victims nor sparked any clashes with<BR>UNITA soldiers, the officials added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clashes between the two sides in recent months had raised fears about<BR>the country's commitment to the Lusaka Peace Accord, under which rebels<BR>were to disarm and both sides were to quarter soldiers before merging<BR>into a new national army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 8, US President Bill Clinton also warned President dos<BR>Santos, during a visit to Washington that ceasefire violations in the<BR>battle-scarred African nation could jeopardise its improving ties with<BR>the United States.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Most human beings are somehow familiar with the feeling of<BR>utter loss when a family loses a beloved member.  But not every bereaved<BR>family experiences the combined anguish of the absence of a breadwinner<BR>and disappearance of family property, thanks to practices that demand<BR>that relatives also &quot;inherit&quot; movable belongings left behind by the dead<BR>person.  Widows in Zambia, under the umbrella of the Methodist Episcopal<BR>Church have formed a society that is fighting for the rights of widows,<BR>widowers and their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Charity Changwe, there was nothing wrong with the decision made<BR>by her in-laws to shift the funeral gathering of her late husband from<BR>her flatlet in Kamenza township to the residence of the deceased's elder<BR>brother in the mine township, about two kilometres away in the same<BR>Zambian town of Chililabombwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After all, like other countries in Africa, it is a common tradition<BR>among Zambian communities to hold lugubrious meetings at the house of<BR>the eldest member of the surviving family in a given locality.  In<BR>addition, the company flatlet Changwe shared with her late husband,<BR>Chris, a surveyor with the giant Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)<BR>at the time of his death in hospital on June 26, 1993, was unsuitable<BR>for the funeral gathering which demands a log-fire in the yard.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But little did Changwe know she had been tricked.  For, on return to<BR>her flatlet a week after interring Chris at Kakoso Cemetery, she found<BR>all the goods missing from the house.  She could not believe the sight<BR>of her house which now resembled a playground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sofasets, dinning table and chairs, a fridge, two beds and<BR>mattresses, and other household goods were no longer there.  She was<BR>heart broken for the second time in a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I learnt later that on June 29 while we were burying Chris,some men<BR>went to the house with a lorry and took all the goods.  My neighbours<BR>thought I was shifting from the flat since my husband had passed away,&quot;<BR>Changwe told a stunned seminar on the plight of widows and their<BR>children, held recently in Chililabombwe about 400 kilometres north of<BR>the Zambian capital, Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To date, she has never seen the goods and efforts to recover anything<BR>including the fridge bought from her earnings as a ZCCM mine police<BR>constable, failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this young widow is not alone in her predicament.  Many in this<BR>Southern African country continue to endure untold suffering at the<BR>hands of in-laws, despite the enactment by Parliament of the Laws of<BR>Intestate Succession Act and the Wills and Administration of Testate<BR>Estates Act, aimed at protecting widows, widowers and their surviving<BR>children after the death of their bread winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Intestate Succession Act which deals with the<BR>distribution of property in a situation where the deceased left no will,<BR>the widow or widower is entitled to 20 per cent of the property, 50 per<BR>cent goes to the children, the other 20 per cent to the deceased's<BR>parents while the remaining ten per cent is given to the dependants, who<BR>in this case is the person or persons who are/were maintained by the<BR>deceased immediately before death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Wills and Administration of Testate simplifies the making of a<BR>will and provides for adequate financial and other provisions to be made<BR>in a will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the continued suffering of widows and their children is the<BR>concern of many sympathisers in Zambia and more so fellow women who<BR>congregate under the Women Missionary Society of the African Methodist<BR>Episcopal Church in Chililabombwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With funds from America's Southern University Democratic Governance<BR>Project, the women have launched a public awareness campaign &quot;aimed at<BR>conscietising the general public and challenging every wing of society<BR>through seminars to join in the campaign to fight against wide-spread<BR>property grabbing and ill-treatment of widows and orphans,&quot; says<BR>campaign co-ordinator, Rev. Paul Bupe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Bupe says no matter how some people might try to justify this<BR>scourge of ill-treatment of widows, the practice remains evil in the<BR>eyes of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This cruel act is condemned from the religious point of view.  What<BR>the Bible has established let no culture or tradition change, says Bupe<BR>who supports his statement by quoting from Exodus 22:22:24 in which God<BR>disapproves the act: &quot;Do not ill-treat any widow or orphan, if you do,<BR>I, the Lord will answer them when they cry out to me for help and I will<BR>be angry and kill you.  Your wives will become widows and your children<BR>will be fatherless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, according to Rev. Bupe's observations, Christians are in<BR>the forefront in disobeying God's ruling, in most cases on a womanIt is the women who make widows crawl on their knees on hard ground<BR>against-woman basis.<BR>for a long distance and smear them with mud and mealie meal (paste from<BR>maize meal) on the eve of the burial of their late spouses. Helpless<BR>widows are abused in the name of cleansing, God forbid with HIV lurking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening the seminar, Deputy - Mayor of Chililabombwe, Mr. Curp Mwaba<BR>said lack of public information on the law of succession is responsible<BR>for the suffering of widows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Property grabbing and other forms of ill-treatment of widows is as<BR>cancerous as AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and must also<BR>equally receive corresponding attention,&quot; Mr. Mwaba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seminar participants had different views when they cited poverty as<BR>one of the causes of property grabbing.  &quot;Many people have turned the<BR>death of a relative to be a means of gain.  Like vultures, relatives<BR>wait patiently for the demise of a wealthy kin in order to share all his<BR>property at the expense of the widow and orphans,&quot; a participant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some said jealous sisters of the deceased often exhibit the most<BR>hostile attitude towards the widow because they think they are closer to<BR>their brother and regard the widow as a stranger.  Such sisters seize<BR>the opportunity at funerals to vent out their revenge on the hapless<BR>widow especially when she did not receive them well and cared for them<BR>when their brother was alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another argued that the situation can be unpleasant in cases where<BR>marriages of the sisters were not stable whereas that of the deceased<BR>brother was smooth.  It is worse in strained marital relations whereby<BR>the widow ends up being blamed for the death of her husband. This is<BR>worsened by the belief that &quot;culture demands&quot; that the widow be<BR>mistreated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the participants were unanimous that there is no specific<BR>yardstick for mistreating widows.  They singled out ignorance about the<BR>law of succession among the victims, perpetrators and the law<BR>enforcement officers as being major contributing factors to the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Changwe admits; &quot;I had no idea at the time of my husband's death<BR>that laws exist in Zambia to protect widows.  Otherwise, I should have<BR>taken the matter to the magistrates court for redress after the police<BR>turned me away saying the issue was civil and that it should be dealt<BR>with domestically between my family and in-laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, considering that she was five-months pregnant with her first<BR>born child, Changwe also feared she would prematurely lose this valuable<BR>gift from God in questionable circumstances.  She felt unsafe to<BR>antagonise her in-laws over her goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although I was neither physically harassed nor sexually abused, fear<BR>of witch-craft grew in intensity when my pregnancy went beyond nine<BR>months.  I gave birth to a baby girl in the eleventh month,&quot; she<BR>revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his contribution to the debate, Chililabombwe Magistrate, Mr.<BR>Kaengele Mulenga criticised the conduct of the law enforcement officers<BR>for displaying ignorance about the law of succession when they are<BR>supposed to be knowledgeable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In many cases, the police turn away victims reporting the loss of<BR>their property believing the matter is of civil nature.  This is not the<BR>case as this is a criminal offence which carries custodial sentences for<BR>the guilty,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Mr. Mulenga, a person found guilty under the law of<BR>succession can either be fined a maximum of Kwacha 500,000 (about US<BR>dollars 590) or get a jail sentence of three years with hard labour or<BR>both fine and imprisonment as the court might determine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He suggested that police officers under-go orientation courses on<BR>succession statutes in order for them to deal with widows' complaints<BR>fairly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seminar participants who included civil servants, mine and Zambia<BR>police officers, the clergy and widows also blamed weak and biased<BR>administrators in the distribution of property and corrupt local court<BR>justices for the disparities in the dispensation of cases of this<BR>nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When a family has a principled and well respected person, very often<BR>the administration of property is done according to the law and the<BR>widow is protected and cared for,&quot; they observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike other widows, Changwe's employment as a mine police constable,<BR>helped her recover from the shock of losing her property. She is now<BR>happily settled in a two-bedroomed ZCCM house in the mine township<BR>raising her daughter now aged over two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her advice to potential widows is: &quot;Be brave and have no fear of<BR>witch-craft.  Take property-grabbing in-laws to court if need be.&quot; Some<BR>timely advice indeed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FREETOWN - Military head of State Captain Valentine Strasser of<BR>Sierra Leone was ousted in a palace coup on January 16 and replaced by<BR>his deputy and armed forces chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports say the 29-year-old Strasser was immediately flown by<BR>helicopter to neighbouring Guinea (in handcuffs), together with his wife<BR>and children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Strasser now joins the man he overthrew at the<BR>end of April 1992, former President Joseph Momoh, who also lives in<BR>exile in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Sierra Leonean government has asked Ghana to grant<BR>Captain Strasser political asylum and Ghanaian authorities say the<BR>request is under consideration.  Sierra Leone state radio announced that<BR>the new leader Brigadier Julius Maada Bio, has imposed a dusk to dawn<BR>curfew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another report says the new leader of the National Provisional Ruling<BR>Council (NPRC) has sacked all government officials seen to be actively<BR>involved in party politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Director of Defence Information, Lieutenant Colonel Karifa Kargbo,<BR>who made the radio announcement, accused Strasser of wanting to cling to<BR>power.  &quot;Captain Strasser has been removed from office and has safely<BR>left these shores due to his blatant attempts to implement legislation<BR>intended to be harmful to the democratic process,&quot; Kargbo was quoted<BR>saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although diplomats remain sceptical of Brigadier Bio's motive, the<BR>new NPRC leader has announced in his first national radio broadcast that<BR>elections scheduled for February 26 will go ahead as planned to return<BR>the country to democratic civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also called on the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of Foday<BR>Sankoh, which has been fighting the government since 1991, to come to<BR>the negotiating table without pre-conditions.  Brigadier Bio promised<BR>the rebels a general amnesty and urged them to participate in the<BR>forthcoming elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FRANCEVILLE, GABON - Round-table talks on the political future of<BR>Chad ended in failure here on January 9 after most of the armed rebel<BR>groups present refused to sign a framework document to end civil strife<BR>and install a democratic system in Chad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gabonese President Omar Bongo was forced to put an end to the meeting<BR>late on January 9 after the document failed to win enough backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since you say 'No' then I want the discussions to stop there,&quot; Bongo<BR>told participants at the meeting, which finally started on January 6,<BR>six hours late, with the aim of ending 30 years of civil war in Chad and<BR>bringing the Chadian rebels into the democratisation and election<BR>process now underway.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting grouped representatives of the Chadian government, legal<BR>political parties, trade unions, various associations and armed<BR>opposition groups, plus mediators and international observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final document was read out to the participants by Gabonese<BR>Foreign Minister Casimir Oye Mba, then signed by Bongo, Chadian<BR>President Idriss Deby and President Ange-Felix Patasse of the Central<BR>African Republic and Mahamane Ousmane of Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the 12 representatives of legalised parties signed the text,<BR>but some abstained along with several representatives of associations<BR>and trade unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But out of the 15 armed opposition groups present, 13 refused to<BR>sign, while the two groups which signed were a faction of the Movement<BR>for Democracy and Development represented by Moussa Medella and a<BR>recently-created group called AFUD, about which no information was<BR>available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the opposing groups wanted detailed discussions between them<BR>before a text could be agreed on and signed, contrary to signing a<BR>document followed by discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when some of the rebel participants called for the resignation of<BR>Chadian President Deby, Bongo accused them of coming to Franceville &quot;to<BR>sabotage the round-table talks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bongo's text had called on all signatories to renounce use of force<BR>to conquer and keep power and appealed to them to uphold democratic<BR>processes as the only path to a lasting political settlement in Chad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also called for immediate ceasefire and amnesty, for armed groups<BR>to be transformed into political parties and for defence and security<BR>forces to be reorganised &quot;along republican lines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting was originally scheduled for last December but had to be<BR>postponed amid disagreements over the participants from the Chadian<BR>side.  All 58 legal political parties in the country wanted to be<BR>represented as did the guerrilla groups, which total 15 according to<BR>Chadian Prime Minister Djimasta Koibla.  Chad has a population of some<BR>5.5 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally it was agreed that the political parties would be grouped,<BR>sharing a total of 10 representatives.  Some protested, demanding a<BR>greater role, but none refused to take part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gabonese government sent envoys to Chad itself, to Benin, Libya<BR>and Algeria to involve the armed groups, while Djimasta Koibla visited<BR>Chad's neighbours, including the Central African Republic, Cameroon and<BR>Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chadian Premier said the government's aim was to get the external<BR>opposition leaders to return to the country and take part in the normal<BR>political process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - The Rev. Maureen Elizabeth Jones made history on January 14<BR>by becoming the first woman bishop in the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was consecrated Bishop of the Methodist Church in Kenya at St.<BR>Peter's Methodist Church, Langata, in the outskirts of Kenya's capital,<BR>Nairobi.  The ceremony was conducted by Presiding Bishop of the<BR>Methodist Church in Kenya, Bishop Zablon Nthamburi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Jones, who was born in the small town of Stamford,<BR>Lincolnshire, England on May 24, 1939, arrived in Kenya in January 1969<BR>as a lay woman worker.  She was initially based in the Tana River and<BR>Lamu Districts in the Coastal Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Jones recalls that she worked with women and children in that<BR>region &quot;in the field of development, both physical and spiritual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After five years of service she proceeded to St. Paul's United<BR>Theological College, Limuru, to help in the training of pastors' wives.<BR>In 1976 she went for theological training &quot;and preparation for the<BR>ordained ministry&quot; at Bristol College in the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Jones returned to Kenya at the invitation of the Methodist<BR>Church of Kenya in July 1979, served as a minister on probation for one<BR>year and was ordained in the &quot;ministry of Word and Sacrament&quot; in June<BR>1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She served as a minister at the Kariokor Methodist Church up to 1985.<BR>In 1986 she was transferred to Kariji Circuit in Pwani (Coast) Synod<BR>where she worked for the next seven years.  In 1993 she was transferred<BR>to the Langata Circuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked what she felt after beating three other male contestants, Rev.<BR>Jones told APS; &quot;To be honest, I did not expect it....I am very moved<BR>and very honoured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A congregant pointed out that Rev. Jones garnered the 83 votes, half<BR>of all the votes cast because &quot;she is very dedicated to her work and<BR>very sensitive to the needs of her congregation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Jones said that working as a bishop, and particularly as a white<BR>female bishop among blacks does not make her feel discriminated against.<BR>&quot;I have lived with these people for many years and I have never felt<BR>discriminated against,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The history of the Methodist Church in Kenya goes back 133 years when<BR>three missionaries of the United Methodist Free Churches arrived in the<BR>country.  Thomas Wakefield, James Woolner and Dr. Ludwig Krapf planted<BR>the first Methodist Church at Rabai, on Kenya's coast in July 1882.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, the church moved to the interior of Kenya arriving in Meru,<BR>Eastern province in 1910.  In 1967 the Methodist Church of Kenya became<BR>autonomous.  Soon after, it opened missions in Northern Kenya (1967),<BR>Western Kenya (1973) and Kwale-Coast- (1977).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1994 the church launched an insurance brokerage firm and is<BR>currently in the process of establishing a full fledged university. The<BR>Methodist Church in Kenya has a following of some 650,000 faithful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before coming to Kenya, Rev. Maureen Elizabeth Jones trained and<BR>worked as a social worker in the United Kingdom.  She says that she<BR>worked &quot;with deprived and disabled children&quot; for 11 years. &quot;I have a<BR>great love for young people and this has very much influenced the shape<BR>of my ministry here in Kenya,&quot; she told APS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE - The Roman Catholic Church in Zimbabwe has refused to<BR>register its relief agency, the Catholic Development Commission (CADEC),<BR>under a controversial new law, the Zimbabwe News Agency (ZIANA) reported<BR>here on January 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Church spokesman Oskar Wermter told ZIANA that Catholic bishops were<BR>unhappy that the new act, which sailed through parliament last year gave<BR>a cabinet minister absolute powers over non-governmental organisations<BR>(NGOs) without providing any legal recourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The bishops are unhappy with the act, which gives the minister<BR>enormous powers and there is no legal redress,&quot; Wermter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Voluntary organisations cannot defend themselves even if the<BR>minister receives false information.  Natural justice demands that there<BR>is recourse to law,&quot; he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church warned that if it is pressurised to register, it will<BR>challenge the matter in court to determine the constitutionality of the<BR>Private Voluntary Organisations Act, an amendment of the 1974 Welfare<BR>Act designed to monitor NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the bill was enacted, many NGOs were concerned but reacted<BR>cautiously, though of late some have openly criticised the act, which<BR>puts them under the direct scrutiny of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS) last month said<BR>that the act went far beyond legitimate oversight of NGOs by the<BR>government, threatening their independence and opening the way to<BR>governmental abuse and corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIMRIGHTS said the new law allowed the Public Service, Labour and<BR>Social Welfare Minister to take over the running of NGOs on a number of<BR>&quot;vague and ill-defined&quot; grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The human rights organisation said that members of NGOs could now<BR>easily be &quot;suppressed&quot; for criticising actions taken by the government<BR>and the new law &quot;is intended to serve as a club against outspoken NGOs<BR>in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of international NGOs operate in Zimbabwe, providing relief<BR>and development programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Zimbabwe's former Prime Minister Bishop Abel Muzorewa<BR>launched his campaign for the March presidential elections on January 17<BR>with a vitriolic attack on President Robert Mugabe, likening him to &quot;a<BR>cruel, drunken father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muzorewa, 71, who was prime minister briefly before independence in<BR>1980, said he had returned to active politics because he was &quot;shocked<BR>and heartbroken by the abortion of our independent nationhood at the<BR>hands of Mugabe and his associates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He accused Mugabe and his ruling Zimbabwe African National Unionraces in Zimbabwe, so that they now live and behave like rats that have<BR>Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party of &quot;instilling fear among people of all<BR>been chased by cats all day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muzorewa is one of only two challengers who have announced their<BR>intention to run against Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly 16<BR>years.  The other is the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, who faces trial in<BR>February on charges of plotting to kill Mugabe and overthrow the<BR>government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All three men, in their 70s, are veterans of the nationalist struggle<BR>that ousted the white-minority government of Ian Smith in the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sithole's ZANU-Ndonga party currently holds two seats in the 150-seat<BR>parliament, while Muzorewa will be standing as a candidate for the<BR>United Parties (UP), a coalition of opposition groups which has no MPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muzorewa, a Methodist bishop and conservative politician, served in<BR>parliament for four years after independence but was arrested in 1984 on<BR>security charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was released before elections in 1985, but after his party failed<BR>to secure a single seat he quit politics. Speaking on January 17 at a<BR>news conference here which was packed with his supporters but with<BR>government-controlled television noticeably absent, Muzorewa said<BR>corruption and mismanagement since independence had plunged Zimbabwe<BR>into the &quot;worst poverty and worst unemployment ever experienced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muzorewa pointed to Mugabe's recent salary increase of 100 per cent<BR>at a time of economic hardships and steep rises in the cost of staple<BR>foodstuffs as a sign of the government's arrogance and insensitivity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - A rebel Ethiopian group is using a radio transmitter in<BR>the former Soviet Union to broadcast propaganda against the Addis Ababa<BR>regime of Meles Zenawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The transmissions are on shortwave frequencies and appear to have<BR>started in early January. According to a spokesman for the British<BR>Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) East African radio monitoring facility in<BR>Nairobi, Kenya, the Oromo Liberation Front started the evening<BR>transmission early this year after the apparent discontinuation of their<BR>broadcasts from transmitters in the United States where they were first<BR>monitored last year.  Such broadcasts are illegal in the US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The BBC monitoring facility believes the radio station is based in<BR>the Ukraine &quot;where there is a lot of spare transmission capacity at the<BR>moment.&quot; The contact address for the station is given as Berlin,<BR>Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shortwave signal is described as &quot;good though somewhat noisy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebel station does not put out news broadcasts, though it carries<BR>strongly worded commentaries, critical of the government in Addis Ababa.<BR>Despite the mid-1995 devolution of power to the provinces that allowed<BR>the various regions in Ethiopia to enjoy autonomy, the radio accuses the<BR>Tigrean people - the tribe of the executive Prime Minister, Meles<BR>Zenawi, of taking the rest of the country for a ride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some correspondence is also read on the radio.  One letter asked why<BR>there are no battle reports on the broadcasts giving information about<BR>the war waged in Oromia by the Oromo Liberation Front.  The presenter<BR>promised that battle reports should be expected in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Oromo people are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia (indeed in<BR>Africa) with a population of 30 million of Ethiopia's 55 million strong<BR>population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The geographical location of Oromia, (homeland of the Oromo) is<BR>southern Ethiopia.  It covers more than 500,000 square kilometres of the<BR>territory - double the size of the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Oromos say successive Ethiopian regimes dating back to<BR>Abyssinian King Menelik II, in the 1880s, looked down on or segregated<BR>Oromo people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UGANDA - The Church of Uganda has set up a commission to probe the<BR>alleged mismanagement of funds in the south western Anglican Diocese of<BR>Mityana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bishop of the diocese, the Right Rev. Wilson Mutebi on January 16<BR>announced that the commission will investigate failure by the diocese to<BR>meet its financial obligations during the past seven years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It will assist the church to find out whether the problem is with<BR>priests, Christians or the administration at the diocese&quot; the Bishop<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also announced the suspension of his diocesan secretary Rev. Canon<BR>Samuel Kamya who allegedly failed to account for US dollars 7,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishop's revelations follow a recent declaration by Church of<BR>Uganda Archbishop Livingstone Nkoyoyo to the effect that the church<BR>would take action against &quot;corrupt and inefficient bishops&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Church of Uganda officials say this announcement by the Anglican<BR>Archbishop was facilitated by the amendment of the church's constitution<BR>&quot;empowering&quot; the Anglican prelate to discipline bishops in the wrong and<BR>take overall charge of the Church affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglican Christians here see the move as a result of widespread<BR>dissent in the church over alleged corruption and abuse of power by<BR>church officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Archbishop Nkoyoyo did not cite any concrete examples, it is<BR>generally believed that he was targeting the Church of Uganda eastern<BR>diocese of Busoga where some Christians have accused their Bishop<BR>Cyprian Bamwoze of mismanagement of funds and church affairs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURUNDI - Extremists from Burundi's Tutsi minority brought business<BR>in the capital Bujumbura to a standstill on January 16, the second day<BR>of a strike launched to force President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya to<BR>resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite a major deployment by crack army troops, residents of the<BR>troubled city appeared unwilling to go to work for fear of ethnic<BR>clashes, and banks, many offices and public services did not open their<BR>doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The standstill was brought about without violence by a Tutsi<BR>movement, Youth Solidarity for the Defence of Minorities (SOJEDEM), led<BR>by Deo Niyonzima and Tutsi extremist organisations, which accuse<BR>Ntibantunganya, a Hutu in charge of a shaky coalition, of conniving with<BR>Hutu extremist gangs fighting a guerrilla war against the TutsiWith its turnout early last week the army clearly distanced itself<BR>dominated army.<BR>from the extremists, but it is frequently accused of collaborating with<BR>them in the small central African highland nation, where relief workers<BR>estimate that ethnic killings claim about 30 lives every day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hardliners in the main Tutsi opposition party, the Union for National<BR>Progress (UPRONA), had also planned to hold a demonstration in front of<BR>the party's headquarters, which were under tight military security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UPRONA radicals want their party to withdraw confidence in<BR>Ntibantunganya and pull out of the coalition and the national assembly,<BR>formed in September 1994 in a bid to stave off mass bloodletting between<BR>Tutsis and Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi, like neighbouring Rwanda, is a powderkeg where 50,000 people<BR>were massacred after the first elected Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye,<BR>was killed in a foiled military coup in October 1993, which the then<BR>government survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 15, diplomats said the authorities had put up a remarkably<BR>united front against the Tutsis, but the extremists gained ground the<BR>next day despite an overnight warning from Defence Minister, Lieutenantsame basket as &quot;those who wreck bridges, sabotage power lines and water<BR>Colonel Firmin Sinzoyiheba, who said he put the Tutsi extremists in the<BR>supplies -- all those whom we are fighting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For three months, Bujumbura has been without electricity and has also<BR>seen water stoppages caused by sabotage.  The Defence Minister called on<BR>the security forces, which have taken a battering from Hutu extremists<BR>in attacks to &quot;act with firmness, lucidity and serenity&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCRA - Religious leaders in Ghana announced on January 16 they had<BR>met Vice-President Kow Arkaah in a move to heal the deepening rift<BR>between him and President Jerry Rawlings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The row between the two men, rooted in a split between the formerly<BR>allied political parties they respectively lead, came to a head when<BR>Arkaah accused Rawlings of punching him during a December 28 cabinet<BR>meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rawlings has since repeatedly and publicly suggested that Ghana's<BR>parliament should find a way to get rid of Arkaah, but Arkaah has said<BR>he would not bow out voluntarily under any circumstances since the<BR>president has no power to sack him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But two dozen leaders from six religious bodies, including Ghana's<BR>Catholic Bishops' Conference, the Council of Independent Churches and<BR>the Federation of Muslim Councils, met Arkaah on January 15 to work<BR>towards resolving the dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegation's spokesman and general secretary of the Christian<BR>Council of Ghana, David Asante Dartey, said the six bodies were very<BR>concerned about the rift and wanted to ensure the prevailing peace in<BR>the country is not threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dartey commended Arkaah's prompt response to the delegation's request<BR>for an audience and said a similar request had been made to the<BR>president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is because of my love for peace and conviction in finding a<BR>lasting solution to the country's problems that I consented to meet the<BR>religious bodies,&quot; Arkaah said of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the alleged attack, Arkaah had claimed cabinet meetings were a<BR>focus for high-level corruption in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the official version of events, Rawlings did not assault<BR>the Vice-President, but simply pushed him to encourage his departure<BR>from the meeting on account of the insults he had allegedly made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The intervention by the religious leaders came shortly after Arkaah,<BR>who had accused Rawlings of punching him during the cabinet meeting,<BR>boycotted the opening of Parliament on January 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would appear as if I offer myself as a punching bag to offer<BR>someone political enhancement,&quot; Arkaah said, referring to &quot;insults&quot; from<BR>Rawlings and his supporters which followed Arkaah's allegation that the<BR>President had punched him in full view of ministers during the December<BR>28 cabinet meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Today's occasion was one only for the president to make a statement,<BR>just like last January 8 parade. I attended the parade and was subjected<BR>to a tirade of insults without the opportunity to exercise the right of<BR>reply, so I wanted to avoid a repetition,&quot; Arkaah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During anniversary celebrations on January 8, Rawlings said of<BR>Arkaah: &quot;He tends to subvert the government from within.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his 90-minute address on January 12, Rawlings repeated a<BR>suggestion made on January 8 that Parliament should find a way to sack<BR>the vice president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cardinal Wamala told Christians at the function presided over by<BR>President Yoweri Museveni; &quot;Taxation should be aimed at improving the<BR>well being of common people --- but to tax medicines meant to save their<BR>lives is not only making their lives difficult but condemning them to<BR>death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cardinal Wamala's remarks come at a time when the Ugandan business<BR>community is complaining about high tax rates in the basically import<BR>oriented economy of this East African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chairman of Uganda Importers, Exporters and Traders Association<BR>Captain Mike Mukula, told President Museveni during a meeting he held<BR>with the association on January 16 that the Anti-Smuggling Unit of<BR>Uganda's tax body is so high-handed that it confiscates a loaf of bread<BR>from a poor Ugandan simply because he has bought it from neighbouring<BR>Kenya, where 90 per cent of Uganda's manufactured goods are imported<BR>from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But President Museveni defended his government's tax policy saying it<BR>is meant to protect up-coming Ugandan industries from foreign products.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - The giant Kenya Co-operative Creameries (KCC), is broke and<BR>cannot pay farmers over Kshs.1.5 billion (US$.27 million) owed them for<BR>deliveries made since August 1994, the Minister for Agriculture,<BR>Livestock Development and Marketing Mr. Simeon Nyachae admitted in a<BR>press statement on January 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister Nyachae noted that a total restructuring was necessary if<BR>KCC was to be rescued.  &quot;There is need to re-formulate the future role<BR>of KCC in the short and long-term,&quot; Nyachae said in the press statement.<BR>&quot;KCC continues to pay over Kshs.30 million (US$ 54,000) interest per<BR>month for its overdraft and farmers are not being paid,&quot; said the<BR>Minister.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Agriculture Minister added; &quot;In the short-term , this would mean<BR>immediate selling of stocks to pay farmers and clear the overdraft,<BR>overhaul the management, and introduce a new pricing system to take care<BR>of both domestic and external markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About the medium and long-term plans for saving KCC from imminent<BR>collapse Nyachae said that there was need to legally establish the<BR>status of KCC and &quot;hand over the responsibility (of running it) to the<BR>original owners (farmers) who can decide to run it either as a coThe giant dairy farmers' organisation is said to be holding rotting<BR>operative or a company.&quot;<BR>products worth Kshs.2.4 billion (US$50 million) in its store.  The items<BR>cannot be sold either locally or abroad due to &quot;poor management and poor<BR>marketing strategies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A section of the local press reported that the &quot;cash strapped Kenya<BR>Co-operative Creameries has in the past sabotaged private individuals<BR>out to market the company's products out.&quot; It further said that the<BR>organisation was receiving 800,000 litres of milk daily but was able to<BR>sell only 500,000 litres, with the rest going to waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya Farmers Association (KFA) Chairman, Mr Mark Too also called for<BR>the immediate decentralization of the KCC.  He said that farmers and the<BR>public have been kept in the dark about the operations of KCC. &quot;Previous<BR>directors used their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of<BR>farmers,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since its inception in 1925, the Kenya Co-operative Creameries has<BR>grown to become a monopoly in dairy processing and distribution in<BR>Kenya.  Today, KCC is the oldest and largest co-operative society with<BR>more than 40,000 members in the country.  It operates 11 collecting<BR>centres, 11 processing factories and has workforce of well over 4,000<BR>employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1968 the Kenya government rationalised milk distribution by<BR>withdrawing operating licenses from KCC's main competitors thus giving<BR>it monopoly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the next decade KCC was rapidly expanded through provision of<BR>government loans and government guaranteed external loans.  In 1980, the<BR>company surplus reportedly started declining and in 1987 KCC started<BR>experiencing loses altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between May 25, 1989 and August 9, 1991 KCC was managed by a<BR>government appointed management commission, following an outcry from<BR>dairy farmers about mismanagement of their organisation and an appeal<BR>from them to save it from imminent collapse.  The commission was also<BR>enjoined to write a prescriptive report which is yet to be made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the second half of 1994, KCC started experiencing serious<BR>financial and management problems and the government appointed a task<BR>force in May 1995 which has run the dairy firm to date under the parent<BR>Ministry of Co-operative Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile dairy farmers across the country have added their voices to<BR>the nationwide condemnation of KCC's management.  Dairy farmers from the<BR>North Rift region, one of the leading milk producing parts of the<BR>country, are reported to have &quot;called for the total overhaul of KCC<BR>management and disbanding of the appointed Task Force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government should restructure KCC with the aim to streamline its<BR>operations to reduce overhead costs and have the current Task Force<BR>disbanded,&quot; Richard Barkoyet, one of the farmers' representatives said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the cash strapped KCC, the Chairman of the Kenya<BR>Farmers' Association Mr. Mark Too said; &quot;I can only compare KCC to a<BR>vehicle which veers off into a ravine.  You need a broader perspective<BR>to rescue what remained of it than the usual cranes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BENIN - Africa's traditional ancestor worship and appeasement of the<BR>spirits is now officially fashionable in the small West African nation<BR>of Benin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government of President Nicephore Soglo declared January 11 a<BR>national holiday to mark the recognition of voodoo as a religion. Voodoo<BR>is a religion based on belief in witchcraft and magical rites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Westerners still refer to voodoo variously as a &quot;cult&quot;, &quot;culture&quot;,<BR>&quot;animistic&quot; or &quot;paganism&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The curtain-raiser to the installation of voodoo as an officially<BR>recognised religion was the &quot;Ouidah 92&quot;, the first festival of voodoo<BR>culture and arts which took place from February 8 to 18, 1993 in Ouidah<BR>some 45 kilometers west of Benin's capital, Cotonou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time, the organisers of the international event which was<BR>opened by President Soglo, took care to suppress the religious basis of<BR>voodoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was accompanied by two high priests of voodoo - Sossa Guedehongue<BR>and Dagbo Hounon.  It was a carnival affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the inauguration of the festival, President Soglo emphasised that<BR>voodoo was the common link between Benin -- indeed the whole of the west<BR>coast of Africa that had provided the slaves during the era of slave<BR>trade -- and the black diaspora of the Americas and the Caribbean.  Many<BR>of the guests came from Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago and West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President pointed out that at least 4 million out of Benin's 7.5<BR>million people worship ancestors or spirits at one time or another.<BR>Those are clearly staggering figures for a country that is regarded<BR>mainly Catholic, with Islam considered the second mainstream religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benin is a poor country whose economy was ruined by the misguided<BR>marxist military dictatorship of former ruler Matthew Kerokou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By 1990, 40,000 civil servants had not been paid their salaries for<BR>at least six months.  Yet by 1992/1993 so highly regarded was the voodoo<BR>festival that the government undertook to pay CFA francs 400 million (US<BR>dollars 800,000) of the CFA francs 800 million (US dollars 1.6 million)<BR>budget for the whole extravaganza.  France offered about CFA francs 100<BR>million.  The rest of the money came from the diaspora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soglo claims 3 million Beninois or descendants of Beninois, migrated<BR>abroad either by the effects of slavery in the 18th Century or in later<BR>years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Voodoo preceded slavery on the west coast of Africa by three<BR>centuries.  The practice thrived in West Africa by the 15th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alan Anderson of the Centre for the Study of New religions in<BR>Birmingham, United Kingdom says Beninois are not alone in the practice<BR>of voodoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Voodoo is the traditional religion of West Africa,&quot; he emphasised.<BR>It was suppressed in the colonial period when it was equated with<BR>witchcraft and it continued to be sensationalised by magazines and<BR>Western writers in modern times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the prominent aspects of voodoo is appeasement of spirits<BR>through sacrificial offerings of children and domestic animals.<BR>Traditional liquor is offered as &quot;libation&quot; for the purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not yet clear how the Catholic Church in Benin views the latest<BR>developments.  Officially it has the largest number of followers of any<BR>one religion in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However it is interesting to note that the head of the Roman Catholic<BR>Church, Pope John Paul II, during his most recent visit to Africa last<BR>September, remarked about the similarity between the Communion with<BR>Saints in Catholicism and ancestor worship in African religions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, at the Resurrection Gardens in Nairobi, the Pope received an<BR>African traditional priest who officially blessed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Anderson points out that African traditional religions are being<BR>revived in many places in Africa.  Very often, traditional religions and<BR>Christianity exist side by side in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa recently hosted a special meeting for<BR>Rascom, a pan-African satellite organisation dedicated to providing<BR>Africa with its own satellite for relaying telephone, data and<BR>television signals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first Afrocentric Rascom satellite, the R750-million Intelsat<BR>804, is under construction by Lockheed and is scheduled to be launched<BR>in the first quarter of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This should be followed by the launch of the Intelsat 805. Both<BR>satellites are expected to be launched into orbit by Chinese Long March<BR>rockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 804 will provide high-power coverage of the entire African<BR>continent, South America, parts of Europe and the Middle East, and even<BR>the east coast of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We aim to pool African resources to create a network for 17 African<BR>countries for their domestic television, data and telephony needs. We<BR>believe that the best way for Africa to be developed is via a regional<BR>approach to be able to show a market big enough to attract regional as<BR>well as international players,&quot; Intelsat group director Hamadoun Toure<BR>told the delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while the 804 would pool the capacity needs of African nations<BR>currently served by some nine Intelsat spacecraft, Toure says that some<BR>services will not be moved -- primarily because of the need for costly<BR>upgrades to earth station equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The capacity on the 804 -- which is still under construction -- is<BR>already swamped and another satellite will be ordered. The 805 will be<BR>the first dedicated land-mass African satellite, orbiting in geoMany of the Rascom delegates expressed concern about funding for the<BR>stationary orbit above Zaire.<BR>project. Intelsat requires a prepayment of more than US$200- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Telkom's presence at the meeting surprised many observers considering<BR>it is not an official Rascom signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the three Telkom representatives all played an active part<BR>in the deliberations. Most of the capacity on the proposed 805 satellite<BR>has already been requested by Telkom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This appears to dovetail with Telkom's plans to integrate its planned<BR>South Africa to Far East (SAFE) fibre cable with the intra-African<BR>Rascom 805 satellite network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Telkom is likely to contribute handsomely in proportion to its usage<BR>of the 804 and 805 satellites. It is the largest Intelsat user in Africa<BR>by far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources in Rascom say that South Africa's official entry into the<BR>organisation will occur within months, if not weeks. They say that these<BR>assurances have been already been given by Telkom chairman Dikgang<BR>Moseneke.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A report on strike action in 1995 has shown that,<BR>despite disastrous predictions, there were less strikes last year than<BR>in previous years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Compiled by Andrew Levy and Associates, the report said that the 1995<BR>level was the lowest since 1988.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the industrial relations<BR>consultancy does not expect the same to happen this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With the new Labour Relations Act there will be a tendency to test<BR>its boundaries and this will cause an increase in strike action. It will<BR>become easier to go on strike,&quot; says Andrew Sparks of Andrew Levy &amp;<BR>Associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report an estimated 1,6- million mandays -- the<BR>number of workers multiplied by the number of days on strike -- - were<BR>lost to strikes in 1995. In 1994 the amount of mandays was 3,9-million<BR>while in 1993 it was 3,6-million mandays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main trigger causing strike action was found to be disputes over<BR>wages, &quot;indicating the wide gap between expectations and delivery&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think the reason there have been fewer days lost is because it<BR>seems as if there is an increased maturity between both parties,<BR>management and unions,&quot; comments Sparks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This maturity is not yet evident in the public sector and among state<BR>parastatals where the majority of strike action took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sparks attributes this in part to the fact that strikes in these<BR>sectors were only allowed recently and &quot;both management and workers are<BR>therefore relatively new to the negotiating process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is confident, however, that the maturity in the private sector<BR>would eventually spread to the public sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he predicts that most of the strike action this year will<BR>still take place in the public sector for some time to come.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The rand has stabilised remarkably compared to those<BR>heady days over 1985 to 1993 when it was in a free-fall against all the<BR>world's major currencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are numerous ways of looking at a currency's value.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The best measure is to consider its nominal effective value. This is<BR>an index comprising a basket of currencies weighted according to the<BR>value of transactions South Africa does in that currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Reserve Bank's index, with a base of 100 in 1990, averaged 81,25<BR>in 1993, 73,71 in 1994 and 69,52 in 1995, a depreciation of six percent<BR>which is not that different from the gap in the inflation rate between<BR>South Africa and its major trading partners. The index is currently at<BR>70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The real effective exchange rate of the rand, which is the nominal<BR>value adjusted for producer price differentials between South Africa and<BR>its trading partners, has barely changed from 98,66 in January 1995 to<BR>98,57 in September (the last available figure). In 1994, it averaged<BR>97,18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over 1995, the rand depreciated by only two percent against the US<BR>dollar (nine percent in 1994), five percent against the British pound<BR>(10%), 11% against the Japanese yen (18%) and 16% against the German<BR>mark (11%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Compared to May when the rand was at its year's low, the currency has<BR>actually appreciated against the dollar (from 3,7 to 3,64 this week),<BR>the pound (5,9 to 5,62) and the mark (2,66 to 2,51).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The average daily turnover rose from $4- billion in the last quarter<BR>of 1994 to $4,9- billion in the second quarter of 1995 and $5,2-billion<BR>in the third quarter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Perhaps the most tricky decision facing South Africa's<BR>monetary authorities is when to lift exchange controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It might be too slow for some, but South Africa has adopted a phased<BR>approach. The abolition of the financial rand system in March last year,<BR>the granting of limited permission for financial institutions to swap<BR>assets with foreign investors, and the Reserve Bank's (RB) phased<BR>withdrawal from the forward cover market all reconfirm the authorities'<BR>determination to liberalise South Africa's foreign exchange market and<BR>to create an investor-friendly environment for foreigners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some see the smooth transition from the dual to a single currency<BR>system as an argument for the quick abolition of all exchange controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But RB governor Chris Stals' firm conviction is that South Africa<BR>must first prepare the way and lead the country into a situation where<BR>the lifting of exchange controls is a non-event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The million-dollar question is when does South Africa reach this<BR>situation. Some feel that reserves have improved sufficiently and the<BR>exchange rate stabilised satisfactorily that the time is now right to<BR>lift exchange controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals has said it will take to 1997 or 1998. He notes that backlogs<BR>have built-up for international diversification in the asset structure<BR>of South African investors and is concerned about the huge pent-up<BR>demand with institutional investors and managers of portfolio funds for<BR>some diversification into foreign assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a start, since July last year, the RB is allowing insurance<BR>companies, pension funds, and unit trusts to invest abroad if the<BR>investment is swapped by a foreign investment in South Africa, thus<BR>leaving no net loss of foreign exchange reserves. By mid-November, the<BR>RB had approved asset swaps worth R5,6- billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RB is also reducing its role in the forward foreign exchange<BR>market where it allows banks a greater role. The RB's share of forward<BR>transactions fell from 18,5% in July to 14,2% in September and its<BR>short-term forward book dropped by $5,7-billion from the end of March to<BR>the end of November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals' cautious approach is based on the presumption that South<BR>Africa must first ensure greater stability in the underlying market<BR>forces before entrusting the determination of important prices to market<BR>forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RB's exchange rate policy is still one of a floating exchange<BR>rate system operating within the constraints of certain foreign exchange<BR>controls. In this situation, it is extremely difficult to assess the<BR>rand's level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals notes that in a new global environment, where exchange rates<BR>are determined by volatile capital movements, the conventional concepts<BR>of over/under-valued currencies, based on the principle of purchasing<BR>power parity, have little meaning. In today's world the rand can easily<BR>appreciate as a result of capital inflows despite a growing deficit on<BR>the current account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ultimately, net capital inflows and a stable exchange rate cannot be<BR>achieved or maintained through superficial intervention or controls.<BR>There is no alternative for sound monetary, fiscal and other macroadjudicators of these policies.<BR>economic policies. International capital markets will be the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this regard, South Africa has virtually fully normalised its<BR>international financial relations and cannot ignore the norms and<BR>standards for financial discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the past year, South Africa has re- established normal relations<BR>with multi- national bodies such as the United Nations and the World<BR>Bank, and joined various international regional bodies such as the<BR>Organisation of African Unity and the African Development Bank. The<BR>country obtained various international credit ratings which enabled it<BR>to raise new funds on the international capital markets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - They trampled through the dust in their droves to hear<BR>the rotund tenor from Modena: elderly matrons in bridesmaids' dresses,<BR>beautiful youngsters in cocktail minis and clumpy designer shoes, and<BR>sensible folk in gear more befitting the rugby stadium in which the<BR>concert was held. Inside, vendors of snacks and cold-drinks cried out<BR>their wares, seemingly oblivious to the occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not even a brief downpour could dampen the determination of the<BR>assembled throng to hear their idol. A pity, then, that the<BR>circumstances should have been so unfavourable. Over a woefully<BR>inadequate sound system Pavarotti sounded like he was singing on a<BR>scratchy 78 recording; bad acoustic planning had the singers' voices<BR>echoing around the stadium, and the odd sound balance had the orchestra<BR>playing far away. And the giant television screens which were supposed<BR>to allow one a close-up view of the singers mostly flickered and went<BR>blank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How does one judge the quality of any performance under these<BR>circumstances? With great difficulty. What was clear was that, at 60,<BR>Pavarotti's voice is still in excellent condition when amplified and not<BR>subject to the strain of projecting without help in a big auditorium.<BR>One was struck by the ease of his delivery, by those hallmark top notes,<BR>and by his unique ability to sculpt the Italian texts exquisitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, there was frustration at the sameness of his<BR>characterisations and at his predictable recipe for pleasing the masses:<BR>his matter-of-fact vocal delivery, slightly rushed, with top notes being<BR>belted out for all their worth and sustained far longer than required by<BR>the composers. And then there was the surprising memory lapse in the<BR>middle of Che gelida manina, an aria he must have sung literally<BR>hundreds of times around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was only in the closing Neapolitan songs and E lucevan le stelle<BR>from Puccini's Tosca that one heard a true artist at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rightly, the greatest applause was reserved for soprano Kathleen<BR>Cassello, who outsang and outacted her mentor in their duets and her<BR>solo excerpts. Her heartfelt E strano from La Traviata and closely<BR>characterised Si, mi chiamano Mimi from La Boheme brought the house<BR>down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conductor Marco Armiliato impressed with his understanding of the<BR>various operatic styles on the programme. Unfortunately the same cannot<BR>be said for the ragged National Symphony Orchestra and the surprisingly<BR>hopeless SABC Choir and the Bonisudumo Choristers. Why bother with this<BR>odd collection, so clearly unfamiliar with operatic style, when there<BR>was a superb opera chorus and orchestra just down the road? It was,<BR>perhaps, simply another instance of bad -- should that be arrogant? ---<BR>artistic judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - After Luciano Pavarotti's concert in early January,<BR>many were heard to wonder about Kathleen Cassello, the stunning young<BR>soprano who so completely stole the limelight at this event. Few were<BR>aware that it is almost exactly 10 years ago that she was a prizewinner<BR>in the Unisa International Singing Competition in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cassello took third place in what was arguably the best field ever<BR>assembled for this competition. Her fellow victors are also household<BR>names today: Sumi Jo is the queen of twittering coloratura sopranos,<BR>while Marilyn Mims is a regular at New York's Metropolitan Opera.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cassello, an American whose family hails from Naples, won a string of<BR>vocal competitions during the 1980s. As the 1985 winner of the Pavarotti<BR>Competition in Modena, she sang Musetta in Puccini's La Boheme with<BR>Pavarotti as Rudolfo. After her European debut the same year, she<BR>travelled the globe, giving more than 200 performances as the Queen of<BR>the Night in Mozart's Die Zauberflste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today she sings a wide repertoire, including all the major Mozart<BR>roles and Verdi heroines such as Leonora in Il Trovatore, Gilda in<BR>Rigoletto and Violetta in La Traviata. Her Gilda has already proved to<BR>be rather special: she made her La Scala debut in this role under the<BR>baton of Riccardo Muti, and was acclaimed last year when she sang as<BR>Gilda opposite the current tenor heartthrob, Roberto Alagna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the evidence of her Pavarotti concert, Cassello (who, admirers<BR>will be sad to hear, has not yet made any recordings) is one of the most<BR>versatile sopranos around. In one evening she was a moving Mimi in<BR>Puccini's La Boheme, an agonising Violetta, and a powerful Lucia in<BR>Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One can only hope someone from Pact Opera was there. A house that has<BR>been so unlucky in the repertoire in which Cassello excels will never be<BR>forgiven if it fails to secure the services of this exciting singer, in<BR>the early stages of what promises to be an astounding career.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Mexican artist Frida Kahlo appears on T- shirts,<BR>calendars and in stage plays. Why are we so fascinated by her?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Little Frida, a cafe catering to the lesbian and gay community in<BR>West Hollywood, is a shrine to the memory of Mexican cult-painter Frida<BR>Kahlo. Surrounded by neo-Mexican decor, inspired by Kahlo's house in<BR>Mexico City, you can even order a &quot;Frida salad&quot;. Little Frida is but one<BR>outpost in a merchandising empire that churns out T-shirts, earrings,<BR>aprons, clocks, pins, calenders and posters bearing Kahlo's now worldFrida Kahlo masks.<BR>famous images. You might even come upon such fetishistic objects as</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kahlo's life has been documented in Spanish, English, German, French<BR>and Japanese. A number of serious biographies can be found on the<BR>shelves of bookshops and museums; one has even been written for<BR>children. She has been the subject of documentaries, feature films,<BR>stage plays -- a character becomes obsessed with her in Harry Kalmer's<BR>Frida Kahlo's Eyes, now running at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre --<BR>numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing. In May<BR>1989 Elle magazine ran a 16-page feature on Kahlo as embodying the<BR>&quot;spirit of Mexico&quot;, while in Vogue of February 1990 there was a 10-page<BR>interpretation of the &quot;romance of Frida Kahlo&quot;. It comes as no surprise<BR>that Madonna has invested a sizeable sum in the hopes of bringing the<BR>Kahlo myth to the silver screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, who was Frida Kahlo? And what is it about this strikingly<BR>beautiful but tragically handicapped artist, who painted her life story<BR>on tin and masonite, that has inspired a huge cult following?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kahlo began painting as a teenager in Mexico City in the 1920s, while<BR>recovering from a near-fatal bus accident in which she was impaled on a<BR>metal pole. At 21 she married renowned muralist Diego Rivera. Although<BR>she lived in a conservative, patriarchal culture, and in the heyday of<BR>murals, when a woman making small, highly personal paintings could not<BR>win much respect, she valued her idiosyncratic talent. Kahlo challenged<BR>and refashioned social codes, sometimes by cross- dressing -- appearing<BR>in photographs or paintings in men's clothing -- or by montaging her<BR>head on to the bodies of male patriarchs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her self-portraits express the burdens that weighed on her:<BR>unbearable physical pain, the grief that Rivera's affairs prompted, her<BR>homesickness when living abroad and her sorrow at not being able to bear<BR>a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is tempting to draw parallels between the tragic life of Van Gogh,<BR>an artist recently made &quot;sexy&quot; by the media, and that of Kahlo. But Van<BR>Gogh is known primarily for his work. In the case of Kahlo, the popular<BR>image is of the artist herself: the characteristic eyebrows which she<BR>connected to create the illusion of masculinity, the elaborate hair, the<BR>light moustache which she darkened, and, of course, the dressy Mexican<BR>traditional costumes which she adopted to affirm her identity and to<BR>hide her broken body. It is her appearance, not her art, that has graced<BR>the pages of Elle and Vogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite Kahlo's larger-than-life standing, she painted less than 150<BR>pictures in her brief career, with barely half of them considered toptwo shows during her lifetime. Today, prices for her works have<BR>notch. Admired by Picasso and adored by the Surrealists, she held only<BR>skyrocketed to more than $3-million a piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current fascination with Kahlo began in the 1970s, when her work<BR>generated excitement in the women's liberation movement. But it was<BR>Hayden Harera's 1983 biography of Kahlo, simply titled Frida, which<BR>elevated the painter to the level of superstar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Looking at Kahlo's contemporary appeal, Harera writes that '&quot;as a<BR>Hispanic woman, a bisexual, an invalid and an artist, Kahlo had all the<BR>qualifications for a cult figure; she embodied everything not straight,<BR>male and Anglo ... For a people preoccupied with psychological health,<BR>fearful of Aids and appalled by drug abuse, the gritty strength with<BR>which she endured her illness is salutory. Although her painting records<BR>specific moments in her life, all who look at them feel that Frida is<BR>speaking directly to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, many say, has led to the representation of Kahlo as a kind of<BR>mascot of marginalisation. It is the portrayal of Kahlo as a victim that<BR>has encouraged the many myths that have been formulated around her.<BR>Stories of her childhood accident and her obsessive relationship with<BR>Rivera become more brutal and bizarre as they are retold. One story<BR>maintains that Kahlo's clothes were ripped from her body during the bus<BR>accident. As she lay naked, a bag of gold-dust that a fellow traveller<BR>was carrying split open and covered the artist's body. But it is not<BR>only devotees who have enjoyed fabricating fantastic twists to Kahlo's<BR>already unconventional life. The artist herself, although born in 1907,<BR>insisted she was born in 1910 -- the start of the Mexican Revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So Kahlo herself contributed to her status as a symbol of cultural<BR>diversity -- a status some critics say has diluted the significance of<BR>her work. Yet by demystifying the work of Kahlo and other artists the<BR>privileged doors of the art world are opened to consumers of popular<BR>culture. In a 1992 travelling exhibition organised by the Studio Museum<BR>of Diego Rivera in Mexico City, a number of &quot;Fridita&quot; artists<BR>participated, while cross- dressing performance artists paid campy<BR>homage to Kahlo. Many gay artists find Kahlo, who paraded her liaisons<BR>with other women, a source of strength because of her unconventional<BR>approach to gender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parodoxically, although Kahlo is considered a populist, she was<BR>intensely annoyed when she noticed that some of her admirers were<BR>attempting to adopt her meticulously constructed image. As early as 1933<BR>she was mocking: &quot;... some of the gringa women are imitating me and<BR>trying to dress _ la Mexicana but the poor souls only look like cabbages<BR>and to tell the truth they look absolutely impossible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frida Kahlo's Eyes is at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre until<BR>February 24</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Yo! You and you! Yo!&quot; The big Texan is standing<BR>beneath the thudding turbine of a chopper in the middle of the<BR>Mozambican bush. He is whooping and yelling and pointing at a group of<BR>bewildered peasants who huddle behind a tree to protect themselves from<BR>a sandstorm whipped up by the helicopter as it swooped into their<BR>settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gradually, above the cacophony, the villagers realise the American is<BR>telling some of them to &quot;stop fiddle fucking&quot; (a phrase repeated so<BR>often it could be called his company's motto), get into the air and take<BR>a look at the natural beauty that surrounds them. This is John Perrott,<BR>general manager for flamboyant millionaire James Ulysses Blanchard III,<BR>and he is bringing his employer's version of rural development to one of<BR>the poorest countries in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vision of Blanchard Mozambique Enterprises is to create a massive<BR>wildlife and tourism mecca stretching from Inhaca Island off Maputo<BR>through the staggeringly beautiful Machangulo Peninsula, across the<BR>Maputo Elephant Park, where one of Africa's last free-ranging elephant<BR>herds lives, and then down to the South African border in the south.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Machangulo Peninsula has the world's highest forested dunes which<BR>jut, south of the island, into a subtropical sea abounding with coral<BR>reefs, dolphins, rays, sharks, marine turtles and endangered dugongs<BR>(strange sea mammal which gave rise to the mermaid legend because it has<BR>breasts to suckle its young).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The $800-million masterplan, outlined in a book called the Black<BR>Bible by Blanchard's men, includes hovercrafts to ferry jetsetting<BR>tourists from Maputo to Inhaca; a Mississippi Steamer which will become<BR>a floating hotel and casino off the island; a chain of upmarket lodges<BR>on the beaches and inland lakes that dot the pensinsula; a national park<BR>that will be supplied with the big five and other animals in the biggest<BR>game restocking exercise ever undertaken in human history; scuba diving<BR>schools; game fishing expeditions; an aquarium; and a steam train to<BR>ferry tourists through this wonderland of wild game and marine life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African consultants have advised Perrott that his dream to<BR>import a group of Bushmen from the Kalahari into the Mozambican theme<BR>park is likely to discredit the project. So has he given up the idea?<BR>&quot;Hell no! If I get my way, I'll bring some of them little guys out here.<BR>Can you imagine tourists on the steam train looking out of one window<BR>and seeing elephants and rhino? Then they'll look out of the other and<BR>see the little bastards running around with their loin clothes and<BR>poison-tipped arrows ... The way I see it we'll bring them rhino here<BR>and save them from going extinct so why not bring the little guys who<BR>are also going extinct?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is unlikely that either the Botswana or Mozambique governments<BR>will grant permission for Bushmen to be part of the scheme. But the<BR>masterplan is being taken seriously by the government in Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The biggest obstacle in Perrott's way is that in 1987, at the height<BR>of Renamo's civil war, the Frelimo-led government granted South African<BR>timber giant Sappi a concession to plant more than 30 000 hectares of<BR>land with a plantation of bluegum trees -- in partnership with two<BR>Mozambican firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Maputo government's aim was to bring a big South African business<BR>into the area as a bulwark against bands of Renamo rebels, who waged a<BR>destructive civil war in the area, with clandestine support from<BR>elements in the South African military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Little thought was given, at that stage, to the fact that the<BR>concession zone is part of an incredibly rich area of plant diversity,<BR>known as the Maputaland Centre of Endemism, and that the commercial<BR>plantation will destroy botanical species which occur no where else on<BR>Earth and also one of the last tropical grasslands left in southern<BR>Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An environmental impact study commissioned by Sappi has recognised<BR>that the plantation could have serious negative impacts on the<BR>biodiversity and water resources of southern Maputo province and has<BR>recommended the planted area be reduced from 32 000 to 21 000 hectares<BR>so the bluegums can be kept away from rivers and inland lakes in the<BR>area. The study points out that the plantation, which could earn<BR>Mozambique some R80-million (about $23-million) a year and create 12 000<BR>new jobs (not all of them full-time), does not prevent other companies<BR>from implementing ecotourism programmes in the Elephant Park and on the<BR>Machangulo Peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Perrott will have none of this. The Blanchard proposal, he<BR>explains, could bring in an investment of $800-million and will create<BR>20 000 jobs in the long run. However, it depends on &quot;critical mass&quot;, a<BR>realisation of the grand plan, and it cannot have a patch of bluegums in<BR>the middle of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So James Ulysses Blanchard III has presented an ultimatum to the<BR>Mozambicans. He will not go ahead unless Sappi is out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perrott's job is to persuade the local population and the media that<BR>his boss is right, which is why he is now in the middle of the bush with<BR>a chopper and a convoy of four-by-fours conducting an exercise in what<BR>the newspaper contingent on the trip dubbed the Texas School of<BR>Community Communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the local chief, his wife and two other volunteers from the<BR>village are taking a flip in the helicopter, the Texan begins dishing<BR>out colourful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T-shirts with a huge map of southern Mozambique on the front<BR>proclaiming that the area is now a national park. The logo on the back<BR>says -- in English even though the villagers speak only Shangaan or<BR>Portuguese -- &quot;Nix to water guzzling bluegums&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women, men and children scramble for the T-shirts while a group of<BR>men gather around Perrott and his Mozambican translator. &quot;Tell them they<BR>gonna have shares in this project,&quot; says Perrott. &quot;The elephants we<BR>bring here are gonna belong to them too. Now you tell them that in your<BR>best Shingaan (sic).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perrott insists that a democratic approach is vital for conservation<BR>to work and that his company will treat the local communities as equal<BR>partners. &quot;We're gonna put a fence up and make this place a national<BR>park and they will be able to choose. We gonna come here and say: 'Okay,<BR>now you're in a national park. Your village can either get fenced in or<BR>you can have them wild animals walking right through your main street'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early in February the Cabinet will meet in Maputo to decide on the<BR>bluegum-plantation-versus-ecotheme-park row. The debate has become<BR>Mozambique's equivalent of the St Lucia controversy in South Africa and<BR>is likely to be the biggest and most complex economic decision the<BR>Mozambican government has ever had to make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cabinet members appear divided on the issue. The agriculture ministry<BR>favours the plantation because it is ready to proceed and will bring<BR>immediate jobs to the depressed area. The environment ministry wants the<BR>ecotourism plan because the plantation will cause irreversible damage to<BR>Mozambican wildlife while it provides raw materials for the South<BR>African paper industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another source of concern in the Cabinet is that Blanchard -- a<BR>cold-war warrior from the 1980s with close links to far-right groups in<BR>the US -- has good friends in Renamo and also the Inkatha Freedom Party<BR>in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the time being though, it appears that opinion in Maputo's<BR>government and intellectual circles is swinging Blanchard's way. The<BR>government will insist on a proper land-use plan and assurances that the<BR>ecotourism project will not be used to benefit Renamo during the next<BR>elections, or link up with seccessionist movements in KwaZulu-Natal. It<BR>also plans to set up a group of monitors to ensure that the rhetorical<BR>commitment to a partnership with the local landowners is put into<BR>practise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it now seems that the man who once bankrolled a rebel army to<BR>wage a war of incredible destruction and brutality (the US State<BR>Department once described Renamo atrocities as worse than those of the<BR>Pol Pot regime in Cambodia) is likely to be rewarded with control over a<BR>huge chunk of Mozambique's richest province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is just one of the many paradoxes that pervade this poor country.<BR>&quot;To understand it,&quot; says one of the officials who works with Perrott on<BR>the project, &quot;you must realise that Mozambique in the past hasn't had<BR>bulldozers that work. Now we have one that does.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A row has broken out over International Monetary Fund<BR>(IMF) plans to impose tight curbs on wage hikes and the few social<BR>security benefits that still exist in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country has one of the poorest economies in the world and one of<BR>the lowest annual incomes per head for its 15-million people: $90 to<BR>$100 (about R315 to R360).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The row began when the IMF started negotiating a new agreement with<BR>the Mozambican government in September last year. The Mozambican<BR>government had just agreed to increase the minimum wage of $14 (about<BR>R50) a month by 37,5%.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IMF responded by pointing out the post-election government had<BR>not met all its budget-cutting targets and issued a hard-line statement<BR>about the need to tighten up the fund's basic controls for Third World<BR>economies. These include cutbacks in state expenses, curbs on inflation<BR>and monetary circulation, financial reform and further privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials from the IMF have since softened their stance after a<BR>number of Mozambique's donor countries -- which usually back the<BR>organisation's medicine for ailing economies -- wrote a letter saying<BR>the Frelimo-led government, which won the election last year, was<BR>actually doing well in terms of economic reform and that the fund should<BR>relax its hard line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, IMF officials have indicated they will not relax monetary<BR>constraints and availability of investment capital until the government<BR>slashes the country's inflation levels, currently running at around 40%,<BR>down to 15%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fund has also been criticised for ignoring the informal sector in<BR>Mozambique. It says this accounts for 30% of the country's GDP, while<BR>senior government sources insist that it is as high as 60% -- and<BR>operates as the most important cushion against starvation, rampant crime<BR>and redistribution of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet average wages for children on the dumbanengues (black markets)<BR>range from 30 000 to 75 000 meticais (R10 to R25) a month, plus one meal<BR>-- much less than the already abysmal R50 minimum in the formal sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Confederation of Trade Unions (ICFTU), which held a<BR>workshop in Maputo in November last year, urged the IMF to realise that<BR>the country's informal sector had mushroomed as a byproduct of the tough<BR>austerity programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government must begin to accord proper attention to the needs of<BR>workers in this sector, with a view to integrating them into the formal<BR>economy,&quot; says the ICFTU report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ICFTU also urges the fund to negotiate its new package of<BR>financial constraints for the next three years -- which is expected to<BR>be finalised in Maputo next month -- with organised labour and emerging<BR>civic organisations. The international union organisation also wants<BR>measures designed to ensure food security and social spending for<BR>vulnerable groups such as women, youth and the aged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Monday afternoon at the Old Eds Health &amp; Racquet Club<BR>in Houghton. It's only 48 hours after they were crowned national heroes,<BR>and the Bafana Bafana seem bemused, rather than irritated, by the fact<BR>that only a few autograph-hunting children recognise them. &quot;Excuse me!&quot;<BR>calls a fluorescent kugel, &quot;what team are you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctor and Shoes have led an invasion of the aerobics class, pealing<BR>with laughter as they throw their gold around. Zane, meanwhile, is<BR>throwing indignant teenage girls off exercycles. Augie is primping his<BR>pecs down in freeweights. Coach Clive is gamely puffing his way through<BR>a circuit. The Feesh, it goes without saying, is in the water, doing<BR>laps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, signature bird's-nest hair tamed by a back-to-front baseball<BR>cap, the youngest member of the South African squad -- and the one most<BR>likely to hit the international big time -- lopes across the floor to<BR>laugh at his buddies in the aerobics class.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There's something mesmerising about Mark Fish. The gangly white boy's<BR>jerky, too-long limbs sometimes seem to be caught in adolescence (he is<BR>21), beyond his control, until they snap, in a moment, into the machineSaturday when South Africa trounced Cameroon.<BR>like precision which earned him the &quot;Man of the Match&quot; vote last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There's no white player black South Africans love more; there's no<BR>South African defender who gets as much attention from the crowd.<BR>&quot;Feeeesh!&quot; the supporters cried every time his boot tapped the ball on<BR>Saturday. &quot;Feeeesh&quot; they cry every time he plays for Orlando Pirates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it's not just because his name, like &quot;Shhhhoooeees&quot;, rolls easily<BR>off the collective tongue of a stadium-full of people. It's not just<BR>because he is a defender who never loses a tackle, no matter how<BR>aggressive the striker, who is given to blazing lone storms across the<BR>length of the field into the other team's goal-box and who reads a game<BR>like no one else on the field. No, it's because he is raw, a rebel, easy<BR>to find (that hair!), easy to read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There's something intimidating about the artistry of a Khumalo or a<BR>Mosheou, something inaccessible about the lofty Masinga; through Feesh,<BR>though, you can live the match, following the fortunes of your team as<BR>they ripple through his posture and register on his features.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coach Clive Barker puts it best: &quot;What impresses most people about<BR>Mark Fish is his body language. He's unpredictable, a character. A Jonty<BR>Rhodes, a James Small. He betrays to the crowds what we're trying to get<BR>across.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barker clearly adores his youngest ward: &quot;He's not my first choice<BR>for the national team! He's my first, second and third choice!&quot; The<BR>bluff, no-nonsense coach plays his part so perfectly you wonder if he<BR>hasn't stepped off the pages of Whizzer &amp; Chips. But Fish stirs even the<BR>coach to poesy: &quot;If I were in the trenches of World War I and I had Mark<BR>Fish next to me, even if there were 1 000 soldiers storming us, I'd be<BR>convinced we'd still win. He's a fighter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's no secret there are talent scouts from the European clubs here<BR>for the African Cup of Nations, and they've got their eyes on Fish.<BR>There have been rumours about Manchester United, and it's believed the<BR>Italians are also showing interest. Soccer writers caution, though, that<BR>a star in malnourished South Africa might not even register a blip on<BR>the Italian or British landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barker believes that Fish &quot;may have the potential to hit the jackpot,<BR>to make the big league if he manages things right. But he may yet go<BR>into the category of the George Bests.&quot; Fish, you see, is Party Animal<BR>Number One in the South African squad. He loves to drink and he can get<BR>unruly. The squad still chuckle at how he told Mike Atherton he was<BR>&quot;ugly&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He loves a good party,&quot; says Barker, &quot;and his parties go on longer<BR>than anyone else's.&quot; As does his hair, even though Barker's caught wind<BR>of a rumour that, if the Bafana Bafana get to the finals, a certain<BR>Feesh might be sporting an &quot;exotic, punk, short, blue do&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There's none of that Mark Fish sitting opposite me at the bar of the<BR>Sunnyside Hotel. He is the consummate Pretoria Boys High alumnus: wellMandela&quot;.<BR>spoken, very polite. He talks, for example, of &quot;Mr Barker&quot; and &quot;Mr</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's clear he doesn't really like the limelight, but he plays ball<BR>anyway, attempting to answer questions and admitting, sheepishly, that<BR>his mind is elsewhere. Despite his youth, he is one of the most popular<BR>members of the squad: it's hard not to like him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is not self-conscious about being a white boy in a black sport.<BR>His best buddy -- and room mate at the Sunnyside -- is Pirates captain<BR>and fellow Pretoria homeboy (and rabble-rouser) Edward Motale. &quot;Fish,&quot;<BR>says Motale, &quot;is not like other whites. I take him to Mamelodi, to<BR>Tembisa, and he'll get up and dance even though he's the only white. He<BR>won't give a damn, he'll just boogie and then others will join him. With<BR>other whites it's different. They need special attention one cannot<BR>afford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Saturday's victory, Fish chose to go with his mates to a bar,<BR>&quot;Tings and Times&quot; in Pretoria, rather than joining the team at the<BR>Randburg Waterfront. Johannesburg, he says, is &quot;flashy and phoney and<BR>false, all these guys who dress to impress&quot;. Motale often accompanies<BR>him on his Pretoria sorties -- a place not known for its mixed venues --<BR>where the pair has become known as &quot;New South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fish lives in one of our land's strange interstices, unrecognised by<BR>his home culture, but a folk hero to millions. &quot;I'll go to a restaurant<BR>with a girlfriend and the only one who'll recognise me is the waiter,<BR>and he'll insist I go into the back and meet all the kitchen staff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps his ease with this is a function of his youth: he was in<BR>nappies during the Soweto uprising. He is, truly, a post-apartheid babe.<BR>Although he is &quot;not rushing to join the ANC&quot;, he acknowledges that,<BR>because soccer has taken him across the railway line, he does have an<BR>insight into the ravages of apartheid his white peers may not have. But<BR>there is something a little too defensive -- or perhaps just young -- in<BR>his comment: &quot;I know about apartheid years, but I wasn't there. It's got<BR>nothing to do with me. I never hated blacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fish, like Eddie Motale, spent most of his childhood playing soccer<BR>at Pretoria club, Arcadia Shepherds. But, while Fish remembers Arcadia<BR>with unqualified warmth, Motale's stories are full of the slights of<BR>petty apartheid. He was left behind in the showers when the white boys<BR>went to the pub, he was dropped from the Colts team even though he was<BR>clearly the best player and at rival Berea Park he was not allowed to<BR>use the facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fish -- like most white South Africans -- wants to erase race; Motale<BR>-- like most black South Africans -- can't. Motale lives with his<BR>parents in Mamelodi; Fish lives with his grandparents in Arcadia.<BR>Motale's mother is a cleaner at Pretoria University; Fish's mother is a<BR>sales manageress at Edgars. Motale had a hard time finishing school and,<BR>aged 29, lives for and through soccer. Fish is in the middle of a Unisa<BR>marketing degree and thinks he may want to move into sports psychology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are intimations that Fish had a difficult childhood -- his<BR>parents are divorced, and those who know him well say, elliptically,<BR>that his drive on the football field is related to his &quot;background&quot; --<BR>but he does not talk about this. The greatest conflict of his youth<BR>seems to have been that timeworn one of white South African schools:<BR>soccer versus rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria Boys High is a great rugby-playing school. They wanted him<BR>to play rugby, he wanted to play soccer. At primary school, he was head<BR>boy. But in white South African high schools, soccer -- the terrain of<BR>dagga-smoking rebels -- is positively unpatriotic, so at &quot;Boys High&quot;<BR>Fish assumed a more marginal existence. He speaks, now, with<BR>indignation, about how the school &quot;did nothing for me, and now has the<BR>cheek to ask me to donate money to a new library. When Robbie Brink made<BR>the national rugby team, they said he was Boys High's first Springbok.<BR>Well what about me? I was already playing for the national soccer<BR>squad!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He clearly doesn't like authority. Soccer administration in this<BR>country is &quot;corrupt ... the administrators get all the money and the<BR>players don't get the respect they earn. I tell you, if I get picked for<BR>a European club, if it's Clive Barker as coach I might consider coming<BR>back to this country. Otherwise, forget it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Right now he's listening to the group LIVE on his walkman,<BR>particularly &quot;this one song, Lightning Crashes, about the world and how<BR>fucked up it is&quot;. It figures that his favourite movie is What's eating<BR>Gilbert Grape? Even though he is as gregarious as Johnny Depp is dark,<BR>there's something unmistakably teen-rebel about him. It's not<BR>nihilistic, wear-black, fuck-you or gangsta-rap rebellion; it's rather<BR>the indie-rock rebellion of vague social conscience, long sideburns and<BR>mellow attitude -- REM and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers are two of his<BR>favourite bands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yes, he is a poet. A promising one at that. Changes (see above)<BR>is filled with the nostalgic romanticism of an alienated Generation-X<BR>yearning for more essential times, when there was nothing to mediate our<BR>experience and we were mad bodies &quot;dancing on the hillsides&quot; rather than<BR>&quot;pair(s) of eyes&quot; staring, through the dark, at TV sets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He wrote the poem for Clive Barker's wife, a ballet dancer, but it is<BR>clearly a meditation on his own career. We are no longer all &quot;dancers&quot;,<BR>but now &quot;cleaved&quot; into &quot;actor and spectators&quot;, soccer-stars and fans.<BR>&quot;We are obsessed with heroes who live for us/ and whom we punish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark Fish must know that he has now become one of those heroes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - National Party leader F. W. de Klerk has yet again had<BR>to insist that rumours of his party's imminent demise were exaggerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk's irritation was not so much with the &quot;disgruntled<BR>individuals&quot; who, by leaking a strategy document to the Afrikaans Sunday<BR>newspaper Rapport had set themselves &quot;on a course of sabotage&quot;, but with<BR>the fact that the document had been interpreted as saying the NP was<BR>preparing to dissolve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk faced having to correct this misinterpretation by saying<BR>what was really intended -- that far from dissolving, the NP meant to<BR>act like an alka-seltzer on the political digestive tract, saving it<BR>from the indigestibility of a one-party state threatened by the ANC's<BR>dominance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But his ire was compounded at having to show more of his hand than he<BR>would have liked. The plan was for him to unveil the vision of a new,<BR>right-of-centre political movement, aimed at injecting fluidity into<BR>South Africa's democracy, on February 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seeing De Klerk, flanked by NP executive director Fanus Schoeman,<BR>media head Marthinus Van Schalkwyk and Cape leader Dawie de Villiers, a<BR>question arose. How could they expect the public to have confidence in<BR>their ability to transform the political landscape when rearranging the<BR>furniture within their own party was proving so problematic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, De Klerk does not see the NP as necessarily leading the<BR>movement it is proposing, which will need substantial black support to<BR>survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has been engaged in intensive talks with business, religious and<BR>community leaders he wants to support the formation of a movement,<BR>founded on Christian values, that could draw support on issues like<BR>bringing back capital punishment, retaining anti-abortion laws, lowering<BR>taxes and limiting state power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He wants to establish common ground with the other minority parties<BR>through &quot;regular discussions&quot;, but an alliance is not necessarily going<BR>to emerge. Essentially, NP strategists are looking for growth to<BR>congregants in the ANC's church who might be encouraged, ahead of 1999<BR>and a new general election, to cross the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are non-racial issues, around which De Klerk hopes to rally<BR>people on the basis of shared values as a way of shattering what NP<BR>strategists see as racially-based voting patterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A clause in the interim constitution demands that MPs crossing the<BR>floor resign their seats. It is not repeated in the draft new<BR>constitution, but may yet appear: the ANC would not want members elected<BR>by voters who backed the party, rather than voting for an individual,<BR>free to do political waltzes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But members -- and supporters -- might just be tempted, if there was<BR>a viable opposition amounting to more than tiny parties relegated to<BR>being permanent opponents of the majority party without any hope of ever<BR>coming into power. To be viable, it would have to be non-racial and<BR>forward-looking, with no hint of being concerned with furthering narrow<BR>ethnic interests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Intelligence officials hope to have their own<BR>investigation into the police bugging scandal wrapped up as early as<BR>next week and will be forwarding a report to both President Nelson<BR>Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will get to the bottom of this -- the who, the how and the why,&quot;<BR>deputy co-ordinator of intelligence Moe Shaik said this week of the<BR>spying row which saw police and intelligence chiefs all but accuse each<BR>other of lying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The investigation by the National Intelligence Co-ordinating<BR>Committee (NICOC) centres on allegations that former security policeman<BR>Dirk Coetzee, now an National Intelligence Agency operative, told SAPS<BR>member Inspector H Moodley he had been assigned to spy on top-ranking<BR>policemen -- a charge Coetzee denies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The probe also focuses on whether or not listening devices or<BR>equipment were found connected to top-ranking policemen's telephones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shaik refused to comment this week when asked whether an<BR>investigation by Telkom had thrown doubt on whether bugs were in fact<BR>found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He did however concede a failure to properly assess the impact the<BR>allegations could have if made public. Shaik said he discussed &quot;rumours<BR>circulating&quot; with SAPS commissioner George Fivaz as soon as he heard of<BR>them. Fivaz &quot;was aware of them and could put them in context&quot;. In what<BR>proved a serious miscalculation, they agreed to let the matter rest<BR>there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shaik said this week: &quot;Our collective response was sluggish. A story<BR>we dismissed as media hype, that we thought was essentially a non-issue,<BR>threatened to become a national crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The lesson to be learned is that we need mechanisms to deal with any<BR>issue that -- whether deliberately or unintentionally -- could threaten<BR>the fragility of the transition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The investigation, by the NICOC, is one of three launched in the wake<BR>of newspaper reports that the National Intelligence Agency was bugging<BR>top-ranking policemen. Coetzee, Moodley and his commander, the head of<BR>the National Priority Crimes Unit, Major-General Suiker Brits had all<BR>been interviewed, Shaik said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A judge to head an independent inquiry announced by Deputy President<BR>Thabo Mbeki last week has yet to be appointed, although Minister of<BR>Justice Dullah Omar told the M&amp;G he expected an announcement would be<BR>made during the course of next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence will be meeting<BR>on February 7 to consider reports it has called for from both the SAPS<BR>and NIA and to decide whether to call individuals to testify before it.<BR>Its inquiry begins officially on February 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shaik said NICOC's report would first be discussed within the<BR>committee, which brings together the National Crime Intelligence Service<BR>of the SAPS, the NIA and the South African Secret Service, before being<BR>forwarded to President Mandela and Deputy President Mbeki for a decision<BR>on how to proceed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The call by the University of the Western Cape's new<BR>rector, Cecil Abrahams, for the province's three universities to take<BR>joint responsibility for its disadvantaged students has prompted mildly<BR>defensive attitudes from two wealthier sisters, the University of Cape<BR>Town and the University of Stellenbosch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abrahams has called for the three universities in the Western Cape to<BR>share the burden of disadvantaged students and take some of the load off<BR>his own university with a streamlined, common admissions centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abrahams outlined his proposal in a graduation speech at UCT last<BR>month, calling for &quot;universities as a collective (to) establish a common<BR>applications centre where we agree to divide among ourselves a preoppressed.<BR>determined percentage of applicants who have been historically</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I propose as well that we address together the difficult financial<BR>situation facing students. It is vitally important that the university<BR>sector in this region develop in an orderly and financially viable<BR>manner. This is not a time for any one of our universities to gloat at<BR>the struggles and misfortunes of a particular university,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abrahams told the Mail &amp; Guardian the educational and financial<BR>poverty of disadvantaged students should be the responsibility of all<BR>three institutions. &quot;This would reduce the responsibility of one<BR>university to deal with all the backlogs apartheid created.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he feared a repeat of last year's admissions saga at UWC<BR>which resulted in scores of students being turned away for non-payment<BR>of fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abrahams said that UCT's response had been &quot;polite&quot;, and Stellenbosch<BR>had not yet responded. He hoped however to schedule a meeting on the<BR>issue next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UCT acting Vice-Chancellor Wieland Gewers said he was &quot;very<BR>interested&quot; in the line taken by Abrahams, but suggested that many cobeen aware.<BR>operative developments had taken place of which Abrahams had perhaps not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've been very active in inter-technikon and university cothree Western Cape universities, Peninsula Technikon and Cape Technikon,<BR>operation in the Western Cape.&quot; A group of five institutions, namely the<BR>has established a vice-rectors' group that meets frequently to promote<BR>co-operation on issues of common concern like staff development and<BR>sharing of libraries, said Gewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Western Cape Tertiary Institutions Trust had already raised funds<BR>for all the institutions and a single mechanism for all five libraries<BR>was being implimented. Gewers hinted that Abrahams was &quot;not fully<BR>conversant with the number of students we do have that are black (51%). &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that his university was flooded with 17 000 applications this<BR>year and had only 3 000 places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The University of Stellenbosch was also keen to remind Abrahams of<BR>existing regional co-operation structures and of its own numbers of<BR>disadvantaged students, which the university was already battling to<BR>fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stellensbosch Vice-Chancellor A Van Wyk said the university had been<BR>increasing its admission of disadvantaged students at an &quot;exponential<BR>rate and 17% of 1995's intake of first year students were from that<BR>group.&quot; Van Wyk said Abrahams suggestions, which he noted with<BR>&quot;interest&quot;, should be taken to the National Commission on Higher<BR>Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abrahams said he was aware of the Committee of Five Tertiary<BR>Institutions but believed the issue was &quot;urgent enough&quot; to be dealt with<BR>by top leadership as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - TENS of thousands of teachers around the country will<BR>soon have to pack up their bags and move to under-resourced schools or<BR>be retrenched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government's commitment to equity in schools and the severe<BR>constraints on the education budget mean many schools will have to cutThe squeeze on the education budget, and the fact that many provinces<BR>back on the number of teachers they employ.<BR>have already overspent on last year's budget, is forcing schools to cut<BR>back on the number of teachers they employ by increasing teacher/pupil<BR>ratios to 1:40 in primary schools and 1:35 in high schools over a period<BR>of five years and cutting back on subject choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, the subjects the country needs the most in terms of human<BR>resource development, like science, will be the first to go, because<BR>these are the smaller, and more expensive classes to run. So too will<BR>the better, more experienced teachers bear the brunt of the cut-backs,<BR>as they are the more expensive to employ.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the only way that provinces can balance their books is by<BR>slashing back on teachers salaries -- which swallow 85% of the education<BR>budget. According to some, the number of teachers currently in<BR>employment is roughly adequate for the country as a whole. For others,<BR>no amount of redeployment will absorb the excess number of teachers<BR>generated by the new teacher/pupil ratios. The 1994 national<BR>teacher/pupil ratio was 1:34 in primary schools and 1:27 in high<BR>schools, implying that enforced new ratios will generate a surplus of<BR>teachers. There are already as many as 15 000 unemployed teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Glaring inequities exist in terms of teacher distribution, with an<BR>abundance of teachers and small classes in most formerly white schools.<BR>It is in the many township schools, in peri-urban informal settlements<BR>and in rural areas, where teacher shortages exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Teachers wanting to keep their jobs will have no option but to<BR>relocate to the areas where they are needed. But moving teachers to<BR>poorer areas brings with it a host of legal, financial and social<BR>obstacles, said Peter Buckland of the National Business Initiative. In<BR>terms of the Educators' Employment Act, affecting state-aided or model C<BR>schools, schools have the right to choose which teachers to employ. To<BR>redeploy teachers would mean amending this legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moving teachers to other schools also implies the need for travel<BR>costs, relocation costs and in some cases, accommodation costs -- money<BR>which the government doesn't seem to have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there is teachers' resistance to moving on the one hand, and<BR>communities' antagonism towards &quot;outside&quot; teachers coming to take up<BR>jobs when their own teachers are unemployed. Many white teachers would<BR>balk at moving to volatile informal settlements where they may not be<BR>welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Teachers Union has agreed in principle to<BR>redeployment, if it means that jobs can be saved. &quot;We are backing<BR>redeployment in that we are backing teachers' jobs. But we need a<BR>strategy to attract teachers to impoverished areas,&quot; said general<BR>secretary Thulas Nxesi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Issues such as housing arrangements and travel allowances would have<BR>to be negotiated, Nxesi added, warning that last-resort retrenchments<BR>would meet with resistance. &quot;We don't believe there's an oversupply of<BR>teachers. If they talk retrenchments we will do whatever we can to<BR>protect our members' jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gauteng MEC Mary Metcalfe said travelling expenses could not be paid<BR>however. She said redeployment had already been negotiated with the<BR>teachers' unions for the moving of teachers &quot;from the better-off to the<BR>more under-resourced schools to be phased in over the next two years.<BR>People will be offered redeployment to areas within reasonable distances<BR>from where they live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Educationally we'd agree that smaller class sizes are better but we<BR>are going through a period of massive reconstruction and we simply<BR>cannot afford smaller classroom sizes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Metcalfe added however that even if the new ratios were complied<BR>with, the province could still not meet its budget. This would point<BR>towards inevitable retrenchments. Metcalfe refused to confirm this in<BR>the absence of a finalised budget or negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Jane Hofmeyr, also of the NBI, &quot;teachers will have to be<BR>retrenched unless we relook at the teacher/pupil ratios and the<BR>education budget&quot;. In her view, it is time to consider loans from the<BR>World Bank. &quot;We don't want a debt trap forever but there are few<BR>countries that don't use loans at some time or another. It is a critical<BR>time for us in terms of human resource development.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Rian Oberholzer, Louis Luyt's son-in-law, has left<BR>his job as South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) tournament<BR>director to take up a permanent appointment in Australia as chief<BR>executive of Sanza -- the company which will control rugby broadcasts in<BR>the southern hemisphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sanza came into being after a R2-billion deal Luyt, together with<BR>Australia's Leo Williams and New Zealand's Richie Guy, signed with media<BR>mogul Rupert Murdoch.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Effectively, this contract gives Murdoch exclusive television rights<BR>to all southern hemisphere provincial and international rugby for the<BR>next 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oberholzer's appointment as head of Sanza is being seen in some<BR>circles as a transcontinental expansion of the Luyt dynasty -- which<BR>includes Luyt's son, Louis Luyt junior, who is general manager of Ellis<BR>Park and Luyt senior's personal assistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oberholzer is also a trustee of the Transvaal Rugby Sports Trust. The<BR>trustees control voting rights and rights to dividends and interest in<BR>respect of the Transvaal Rugby Football Union's investment in Ellis<BR>Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oberholzer's move and reports of Luyt's property sales have fuelled<BR>speculation that Luyt intends to leave the country. Two weeks ago the<BR>Mail &amp; Guardian reported Luyt's house in the plush Johannesburg suburb<BR>of Saxonwold had been placed on the market, apparently for a staggering<BR>R7-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has also been reported that Luyt's luxurious Ballito holiday-home<BR>was up for sale over the festive season, but was inexplicably withdrawn<BR>after a short period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The SABC's news and actuality coverage -- the mainstay<BR>of the broadcaster's operation -- has lost more than a quarter of a<BR>million viewers over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The corporation's eight o'clock English news slot has suffered a drop<BR>of a minimum of 100 000 viewers, while the equivalent 30-minute<BR>Afrikaans bulletin lost 200 000 viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new, &quot;improved&quot; Agenda Newsline also suffered a decline of about<BR>100 000 viewers, but it is not clear from market research where the<BR>audience has moved to.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been a &quot;steady decrease&quot; in the number of people who watch<BR>news and actuality, said SABC news and actuality research manager, Dr.<BR>Stoffel Blaauw, adding that people either watch only half the news,<BR>change channels, or just switch off their television sets for the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blaauw said the decline began when the SABC shifted from being a<BR>commercial broadcaster to becoming a public broadcaster, adding that the<BR>drop of 300 000 viewers was a &quot;minimum average&quot; of the total number of<BR>people lost to news and actuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The drop began as early as September 1993, when the political agenda<BR>of the SABC changed and it had to adapt to a changing South Africa by<BR>ridding itself of the stereotyped black television channels -- the<BR>former TV2 and TV3 -- and market a television service that was more<BR>representative of the broader spectrum of South Africans,&quot; Blaauw said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the SABC's top brass was trying its best to broadcast to all<BR>language groups but, because it was a mammoth task and one could not be<BR>all things to all people, certain local English and Afrikaans groups<BR>were becoming &quot;increasingly annoyed&quot; with the drop in standards of<BR>television, especially news and actuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With about 10,5-million households connected to television, a steady<BR>decline of this nature could see a drop of close to a million viewers by<BR>the time the next elections are due.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blaauw predicted that people would be increasingly incensed to find<BR>that, with the relaunching of channels, the corporation was using<BR>material which was &quot;currently on the shelf&quot; because of time and<BR>budgetary constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said top management was, despite having its own agenda, open to<BR>suggestions gathered from research conducted and keen to improve the<BR>image of the SABC, but added that the &quot;new look&quot; SABC would be a case of<BR>&quot;let's wait and see what happens&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The grand plan for a spectacular relaunch of the SABC<BR>to shake off the last vestiges of its heritage as a bastion of Afrikaner<BR>nationalism, has been dampened by a last-ditch bid by the language<BR>lobby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the Rapportryers and other bodies dedicated to the protection of<BR>the Afrikaans language signalled that they would fight -- through the<BR>courts, if necessary -- any downgrading of their language on the<BR>national broadcaster, the Independent Broadcasting Authority had to sit<BR>up and take note. In the interim Constitution, the Afrikaans language<BR>lobby has a powerful weapon, and the Independent Broadcasting Authority<BR>(IBA), which had been relaxed about the formalities of SABC's planned<BR>changes, would be vulnerable to legal attack if it did not follow the<BR>letter of the law and hold public hearings, which would allow the<BR>language lobby to pursue its objections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That sparked off this week's power struggle between the two premier<BR>bodies of South African broadcasting, both of which are determined to<BR>show that they are in charge of reshaping the public broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SABC for the moment lacks IBA approval to amend its television<BR>broadcast licences in such a way as to allow the corporation to spread<BR>South African languages equitably across all three new channels as it<BR>had planned to do next month. The IBA is refusing to give this approval<BR>until public hearings have been held in terms of the Broadcasting Act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SABC is to press on with its plans to relaunch its TV services on<BR>February 4, but the still-unchanged broadcast licences mean the<BR>corporation now has two weeks to revise schedules which took months to<BR>compile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IBA and SABC accuse each other of provoking this crisis. The SABC<BR>said it had held discussions with the IBA as early as September and that<BR>the regulatory body was &quot;well aware&quot; of what was coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IBA sources in turn said the authority had repeatedly informed SABC<BR>top management of the need to make a formal application to amend its<BR>broadcast licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SABC further alleges that, based on discussions held between the<BR>parties, there &quot;did not seem to be a problem&quot; until earlier this week<BR>when press reports alerted the SABC to the IBA's decision against<BR>granting an immediate amendment. The possibility of legal irregularities<BR>in the SABC's plans was first made public when Afrikaner organisations<BR>threatened the SABC with court action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rapportryersbeweging said programme restructuring and language<BR>changes by the SABC were being done single-handedly by the corporation.<BR>The Rapportryers threatened to take the SABC to court and to make<BR>submissions to the IBA regarding the planned relaunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IBA was alerted and the SABC was informed that it would have to<BR>comply by amending its licence and allowing for public scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu said the launch on February 4<BR>was not challenged by the IBA at the parties' last meeting in midamendment would be a minor technicality&quot;. The IBA denied this.<BR>December, adding that the corporation was &quot;made to understand that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some sources see the IBA-SABC wrangle as a misunderstanding due to<BR>bad communication; others believe it is a power struggle over who has<BR>the greater authority, while others insinuate that were it not for the<BR>stir caused by the Afrikaner men-only movement, the stand-off between<BR>the parties would have been averted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question that remains is whether the two had agreed in principle<BR>on the amendment being granted as a mere formality and whether plans<BR>were upset by a small Afrikaans fringe group insisting on its democratic<BR>right to scrutinise the new SABC changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SABC communications head Ken Modise insisted that no individual was<BR>responsible for the misunderstanding, since each meeting between the<BR>parties was attended by at least three representatives from each<BR>organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IBA spokesman Amos Vilakazi denied that there was a power struggle<BR>between them, adding that the IBA was merely doing its regulatory duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SABC is adamant that it was complying with the Broadcasting Act<BR>by handing in its application for an amendment when it did. According to<BR>one SABC official, the IBA had dragged its heels in getting the<BR>application gazetted and this contributed to the delay in notifying the<BR>public of imminent changes within the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a feeling within the SABC that the IBA was whipping up a<BR>logistical storm in a teacup, and that it did not have the right to<BR>dictate the language preference used on the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IBA, however, felt that the handing in of the application two<BR>months ago -- in early October rather than in mid-December -- would have<BR>been more acceptable and would have allowed for public scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The effect of the application is that it transforms public<BR>broadcasting in this country and, while we are not opposed to the SABC,<BR>we are opposed to the procedurally incorrect manner in which it has gone<BR>about doing it,&quot; an IBA source said. He stressed the IBA was merely<BR>doing its job as a media regulator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the wake of this week's fiasco, SABC management has asserted its<BR>commitment to public consultation, and has argued that going ahead with<BR>its revised plan was the best way to give the public an idea of what the<BR>changes involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We believe the public will be better informed once they have seen<BR>what is offered,&quot; Modise said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Modise confirmed that the corporation is to go ahead with its<BR>February 4 relaunch while still abiding by the terms of its existing<BR>licences. This will, however, involve a rearrangement of the schedules<BR>in order to keep the dominant languages on each channel the same as at<BR>present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SABC sources suggest the corporation paid little attention to the<BR>need to seek a formal licence amendment, lulled into false security by<BR>the fact that the IBA had raised no objections when African languages<BR>were introduced into TV1's Good Morning South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, licences stipulate the dominant languages for each channel.<BR>While the GMSA changes did not change the status of English and<BR>Afrikaans as the dominant languages on TV1, the changes that were<BR>planned for February 4 would have reached much further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Briefing TV staff on Wednesday, Jill Chisholm, head of Television<BR>News Production and acting head of television, pointed out there was no<BR>precedent for a South African broadcaster applying for a licence<BR>amendment as opposed to a fresh licence, hence the lack of clarity over<BR>correct procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chisholm also expressed disappointment that changes which &quot;are part<BR>of a root and branch transformation&quot; of the SABC had been stymied by the<BR>problems raised by the IBA, when in fact the IBA and SABC were in<BR>agreement on the kind of transformation which the corporation needed to<BR>undergo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stressing the need for discretion, Chisholm expressed concern about<BR>&quot;running into IBA sensitivities about power and authority&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wednesday's briefing was the first time that staff who will be<BR>implementing the new programme format had been officially informed of<BR>the plans. Chisholm apologised to staff for the fact that they had heard<BR>about the changes in line-up in the press before being briefed by the<BR>SABC. The briefing was intended to take place earlier but had been<BR>delayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Staffers have in the meantime voiced frustration at what they see as<BR>the superficial nature of the changes planned at the SABC, at the<BR>confusion over the lines of managerial command, and at the corporation's<BR>tardiness in informing them about the changes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial will then focus on the assassination of human rights lawyer<BR>Bheki Mlangeni whose head was blown apart by a bomb planted in a<BR>cassette recorder.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of witnesses -- including the man who manufactured the<BR>Mlangeni bomb -- are likely to tell the court that De Kock, former<BR>commander of the notorious Vlakplaas unit, arranged for the deadly<BR>parcel to be sent to his old enemy, renegade policeman Dirk Coetzee, in<BR>London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coetzee was unable to pay demurrage costs in Lusaka and it was then<BR>sent back to lawyer Bheki Mlangeni who had been listed as the sender.<BR>When Mlangeni received the package, he placed a cassette in the<BR>recorder, put on the headphones and detonated the device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Transvaal Attorney General's office may interrupt the trial after<BR>it resumes in order to charge De Kock in connection with the smuggling<BR>of weapons to Inkatha Freedom Party paramilitary camps during the early<BR>1990s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Department of Military Intelligence was heavily<BR>involved in the illegal sale of elephant tusks from Angola between 1978<BR>and 1986 -- and a commission of inquiry, established by the South<BR>African Defence Force in 1988 to probe these deals, was a white-wash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the main finding of the Kumbleben Commission which this week<BR>released a 200-page report about its inquiry into the smuggling of rhino<BR>horn and elephant tusks in South Africa. The commission was appointed by<BR>President Nelson Mandela in October 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice ME Kumbleben also criticises Operation Lock, the<BR>controversial covert operation by former British special forces officers<BR>to combat poaching in Southern Africa in the late 1980s, and says the<BR>World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the head of its South African branch must<BR>take some responsibility for the behaviour of this unit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kumbleben report finds there was large-scale destruction of<BR>wildlife, including elephants and rhinos, in north-eastern Namibia and<BR>Angola as a result of the 1980s wars in those countries. Most of the<BR>ivory and rhino horn obtained by poachers during this period was<BR>illegally exported through South Africa by SADF military intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Roos Commission, set up by the defence force in 1988 to probe<BR>press reports of military involvement in the illicit trade, claimed that<BR>only about 500 tusks captured by Unita from poachers were handled by the<BR>military from 1978 onwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kumbleben describes this commission as a &quot;charade&quot; designed to<BR>exonerate the SADF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report lambasts a scheme hatched by conservationists in the late<BR>1980s to use former British special forces officers to combat poaching<BR>in Southern Africa. It describes Operation Lock -- financed by Prince<BR>Bernhard of the Netherlands and set up by John Hanks (then the WWF's<BR>project manager at its headquarters in Geneva) -- as being &quot;accountable<BR>to no one&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kumbleben also suggests that more than 100 rhino horns provided to<BR>these officers by the Natal Parks Board and conservation authorities in<BR>Namibia for supposed sting operations were later misappropriated by<BR>members of Operation Lock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sections of the report contain extracts from a secret document<BR>(called Q in the report) which shows that the anti-poaching operation<BR>was infiltrated by members of South African military intelligence after<BR>it set up headquarters in South Africa. This was apparently designed to<BR>ensure Operation Lock could be &quot;put to good use by the necessary South<BR>African information collecting departments&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document claims that Colonel Ian Crooke, the commander of<BR>Operation Lock, had offered to help in &quot;the monitoring of anti-South<BR>African bodies which are situated overseas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evidence presented to the commission suggests that document Q --<BR>which appears to be an internal Operation Lock memo -- was drawn up by a<BR>South African military intelligence officer called Mike Richards, who<BR>had managed to infiltrate the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kumbleben questions claims by Hanks that the WWF, the world's biggest<BR>conservation NGO, was not aware of Operation Lock's activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It goes on to stress, however, that &quot;those responsible for putting<BR>Lock in place did not have the ulterior motive of Lock functioning as<BR>some sort of espionage or intelligence collecting agency for the RSA. It<BR>was intended by them to be an anti-poaching or anti-smuggling operation<BR>and nothing more. It may have later been contaminated by other<BR>objectives and considerations referred to in document Q.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hanks said his involvement in purchasing rhino horn to entrap<BR>smugglers was a sincere attempt to save Africa's dwindling black rhino<BR>stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was nothing to do with Operation Lock, it was a totally different<BR>project. The WWF had done nothing wrong in this regard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the assistance of Prince Bernhard, Hanks raised R250 000 to<BR>purchase rhino horn to trap smugglers. Although the horn was never again<BR>accounted for, Hanks believes it was money well spent. &quot;There was a<BR>group of people tested to do the undercover work. They never reported to<BR>the WWF.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hanks said he could not comment further until he had read the<BR>Kumbleben report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Former Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) deputy president<BR>and now chairman of Telkom, Advocate Dikgang Moseneke, has been<BR>approached to lead the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was confirmed by PAC MP Patricia de Lille late this week. De<BR>Lille, however, said she did not yet know what his response has been.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This follows the resignation of general secretary Maxwell<BR>Nemadzivhanani early this week, which renewed attention to the troubled<BR>party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nemadzivhanani said he had received a lot of criticism from party<BR>members, and so felt he should hand over to other &quot;capable&quot; people. He<BR>told the Mail &amp; Guardian he planned to look for work in the government,<BR>but he was keeping his options open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since its disastrous results in both the 1994 national elections and<BR>last year's local government elections, the PAC has been plagued by<BR>allegations of leadership ineptitude which were particularly directed at<BR>its dour president Clarence Makwetu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Makwetu held on to the party's senior position by eight votes in<BR>1994, against a last-minute challenge from Motsoko Pheko, who had<BR>arrived from overseas on the penultimate day of the party's four-day<BR>congress in Mmabatho. Pheko is now deputy president and most likely to<BR>be elected president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month the PAC's student wing the Pan Africanist Students<BR>Organisation (Paso), declared the party was in an &quot;anarchical state of<BR>affairs&quot; and was experiencing a &quot;leadership crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paso called for the ousting of Makwetu, Maxwell Nemadzivhanani (whom<BR>they described as &quot;arrogant and devisive&quot;), MP Gora Ibrahim, and former<BR>deputy president Johnson Mlambo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following Paso's call the PAC National Executive Committee decided to<BR>change the status of the party's annual general conference, scheduled<BR>for Easter weekend, to a congress where a new leadership can be elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Lille confirmed there was a lot of agitation within the party, but<BR>denied it was crumbling to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moseneke told the M&amp;G: &quot;No. I decline. It's great to know I'm still<BR>loved out there, but I have no interest in a political career.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Over drinks in hotel bars in Germany last week, new<BR>friendships were formed that bode well for the writing of the final<BR>constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During a week-long, fact-finding tour to Germany, Inkatha Freedom<BR>Party (IFP), African National Congress (ANC) and National Party (NP)<BR>politicians were able, for the first time since the IFP walked out of<BR>the Constitutional Assembly last year, to talk to each other --<BR>sometimes late into the night -- about South Africa's constitutional<BR>future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back home this week, the delegates were cautiously optimistic about<BR>the effect the mission would have on the constitution-writing process<BR>and, in particular, on the stand-off between the IFP and the ANC over<BR>international mediation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At this stage -- and it is early days yet -- the signs of a new<BR>interparty rapport are good, with even the IFP delegates taking a more<BR>amiable line than usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP negotiator, Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela, said<BR>this week he had already briefed party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi about<BR>the trip and Buthelezi had been &quot;positively surprised&quot; at what he had to<BR>say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mzimela said of the trip: &quot;I think we got the chance to interact<BR>across party lines ... if the group had had the power to make decisions,<BR>certainly there would have been movement on issues because we were able<BR>to understand a lot of things collectively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mzimela believed there would be follow-up talks between parties on<BR>what had been learnt, but would not commit himself on whether the IFP<BR>would return to the Constitutional Assembly to participate fully in the<BR>final, and most important, phases of the constitutional negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said international mediation had not been mentioned during the<BR>visit, and in any case &quot;the media have overplayed the whole issue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we in South Africa could solve our problems, we would not need<BR>international mediation ... what we did realise abroad was that the<BR>international mediation was not just an IFP and ANC problem, it was a<BR>problem to be resolved by all the parties,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A source in the German delegation said that a particularly good<BR>relationship had been established between the three M's -- Mzimela,<BR>National Party Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer, and his ANC<BR>deputy Valli Moosa -- the same trio who met to resolve the international<BR>mediation crisis last year, and abandoned the attempt in bad humour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democratic Party constitutional expert Colin Eglin said this week the<BR>trip could be intepreted as a &quot;diluted form of international mediation&quot;,<BR>as it was away from home and because they learnt from the Germans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report on the tour is being drawn up by the three technical<BR>advisers who accompanied the team. It is possible that this report will<BR>form the basis of further discussions with the IFP and parties within<BR>the Constitutional Assembly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - A report issued by the authoritative London-based Economist<BR>Intelligence Unit (EIU) has predicted a Museveni victory in the forthcoming<BR>presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It will be very surprising if President Yoweri Museveni, is not returned<BR>to office next April as the elected president,: the just released 1995 4th<BR>quarter country report, says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report, however, doubts whether all sections of society will accept the<BR>legitimacy of his election.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time it casts a shadow over the loyalty of the army towards any<BR>other person other than Museveni. &quot;The army remains Mr. Museveni's trump<BR>card,&quot; it states, therefore disqualifying the possibilities of the army<BR>supporting any other democratically elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also suggests that the legislative elections in May 1996 will produce a<BR>better political balance in parliament, and thereby defuse some political<BR>tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report, NRM is already confident of victories in Karamoja<BR>-- because NRM has allowed the K'jongs to keep their guns. Busoga--VP<BR>Kazibwe's home area, Bugisu, Kapchorwa and his traditional base the SouthThe report further states that, &quot;Mr Museveni is even trying to tempt former<BR>west.<BR>president, Idi Amin, back to Uganda in order to capitalise on his support in<BR>the North West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The EIU report which briefly portrays the current political and economic<BR>state of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, cites the new constitution and the<BR>escalating military expenditure of the Uganda government as a possible source<BR>of disagreement between the donor community and the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report, &quot;the USA clearly believes that a five-year wait<BR>before the issue of multi-partyism can again be tested is too long. It adds<BR>that European countries previously reluctant to show their resentment on the<BR>matter, have now formally joined the US in pressing for an early<BR>constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government reduced the defence share of budget expenditure from 36% in<BR>1990/91 to 13% in 1991/92, but then raised it again during the following two<BR>years and brought it up to 30% this year (1995),&quot; the reports notes. The donor<BR>community is not at all happy with this trend regardless of the insecurity in<BR>the north and along the Sudan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report says that the rift between president Moi of Kenya and Museveni<BR>which used to be portrayed as a largely personal matter, has developed into &quot;a<BR>more substantial rift based on the different approaches to systems of<BR>government.&quot; It blames the failure to achieve regional cooperation on this cat<BR>and mouse relationship between these two leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike by medical workers last September is cited in the report as a<BR>possible beginning of demands to be floated by the public sector workers.<BR>This, the report goes on, would result into an inflationary wage spiral that<BR>would threaten the climate of economic stability which has been achieved in<BR>recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is expected to be compounded by unfavourable economic prospects<BR>especially following the recent decline in coffee prices. The end of this<BR>coffee boom was marked by the October fall in the value of the shilling, after<BR>a two year spell of stability, the EIU report notes.</SPAN></P>

SSS agents also confiscated 20,000 copies of &quot;Tell&quot;<BR>magazine's Christmas Day edition with the cover story &quot;Abacha is<BR>Adamant: Terrorizes the Opposition.&quot; On December 27, SSS agents made a<BR>failed attempt to search his office for the company's tax records and<BR>staff pay records.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Authorities continue to hold Igiebor in solitary confinement without<BR>charge, and are demanding that he reveal his sources for articles<BR>published in Tell criticizing the military government. During<BR>interrogations at Lagos State Command of the SSS facility in Shangisha,<BR>Igiebor repeatedly stated that he receives financial support from<BR>neither outsiders nor Nigerian citizens, and that any information he<BR>receives arrives by mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ also denounces the following attacks against the independent<BR>press during the last two weeks of 1995:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * On December 31, the office of the magazine division of the<BR>Independent Communications Network Limited, publishers of &quot;The News,&quot;<BR>&quot;Tempo,&quot; and &quot;Tempofootball,&quot; was torched by arsonists using a petrol<BR>bomb. According to Dapo Olorunyomi, editor -in-chief of &quot;The News,&quot; the<BR>fire destroyed property (including a new line of Gateway 2000 Pentium<BR>computers) worth millions of naira. The arsonists managed to escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The office, located on the first floor of Tejumola House in Ikeja,<BR>Lagos, houses the newsroom and production center of the three magazines.<BR>It was the only floor of the four-story building that was torched.<BR>Management expects publication of The News and Tempo to be suspended for<BR>approximately two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 19, photojournalists Peter Obe, Bayo Ewuoso, Abiodun<BR>Ajala and Segun Olakitan were assaulted and detained by police during<BR>the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) rally in Lagos. Their offense<BR>was photographing the confrontation between NADECO supporters and the<BR>over five hundred policemen who shot tear gas into the crowd to disperse<BR>the protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ewuoso, a senior photojournalist with &quot;AM News&quot; was severely beaten<BR>by over ten policemen who later transported him to the Surulere Police<BR>Station for interrogation. Ajala of &quot;This Day&quot; newspaper, Olakitan of<BR>&quot;Tell&quot; magazine, and veteran photojournalist Obe were also beaten and<BR>seriously injured by police. Ajala and Olakitan were rushed to a nearby<BR>hospital for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 16, ten security operatives lay siege to the &quot;AM News&quot;<BR>office, demanding to know the whereabouts of editor-in-chief Bayo<BR>Onanuga. They were seeking Onanuga to place him under arrest. Onanuga<BR>remains in hiding. The security operatives reportedly did the same at<BR>the offices of &quot;Tell&quot; magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 16, all 55,000 copies of &quot;Tell&quot; were seized at the<BR>printing house. The seizure followed the magazine's publication of an<BR>article titled &quot;The Release of (Chief Moshood) Abiola: The World Waits<BR>On (General Sani) Abacha.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 15, arsonists torched the circulation department of &quot;The<BR>Guardian&quot; newspaper. Damage was minimal because the fire was quickly<BR>brought under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 15, Adedisi Dejo, Emmanuel Piper, Yeni Oldwolabi and Iyi<BR>Isaac, reporters and contributors to the paper, were held for<BR>questioning by Lagos police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, CPJ intensified its call for the release of the four<BR>journalists (Christine Anyanwu, George Mbah, Ben Charles Obi and Kunle<BR>Ajibade) who were convicted to fifteen years in jail for their alleged<BR>participation in an alleged coup plot against the military regime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Text of several recent news alerts by the New York-based<BR>Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 12 January 1996, Stanton Peabody, acting managing director of the<BR>&quot;Daily Observer&quot;, was released after Press Union of Liberia attorneys,<BR>through the Justice &amp; Peace Commission, filed a bill of habeus corpus on<BR>his behalf. Peabody was released on bail of $20,000 Liberian (US$ 400).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peabody will return to court on 16 January, as will editor-in- chief<BR>of the &quot;Daily Observer&quot; James Seitua. However, the two journalists will<BR>be tried separately on charges of &quot;criminal malevolence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Immediately after the court ordered Peabody's release, Director of<BR>National Police Joseph Tate ordered seven police officers to re-arrest<BR>him in the courthouse. However, the presiding judge announced that any<BR>re-arrest would place Tate in contempt of court. Peabody plans to remain<BR>at home until the upcoming court date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 11 January 1996, representatives of the Press Union of Liberia and<BR>the management of the &quot;Daily Observer&quot; obtained a bill of release for<BR>James Seitua, editor-in-chief of the &quot;Daily Observer&quot;. Bail in the<BR>amount of $25,000 Liberian dollars ($350 US) was paid. Under the<BR>conditions of his release, Seitua cannot travel outside of Monrovia, and<BR>must report daily to the police until the matter is resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charge against Seitua, as stated in his bill of release, is<BR>&quot;criminal malevolence.&quot; No charges have been filed against him in a<BR>court of law. On 29 December 1995, the &quot;Daily Observer&quot; published an<BR>article that disputed the claim made by United Revolutionary Front of<BR>Sierra Leone spokesperson Eddie Hebron that he was interviewed in the<BR>Ivory Coast by the British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of<BR>America. The article claimed that Hebron was in Monrovia, the Liberian<BR>capital, during the interviews. James Seitua was subsequently arrested<BR>on 9 January and detained; he has since been released on bail. Stanton<BR>Peabody, in an attempt to intervene on Seitua's behalf, was also<BR>arrested on 10 January. He remains in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 8 January 1996, D. Sompon Weah II, reporter for &quot;The News&quot;, and<BR>&quot;The News&quot; photographer Pewee S. Flomoku were attacked in Po River<BR>(northwestern Liberia), where they were covering skirmishes between West<BR>Africa peacekeeping forces (ECOMOG) and warring factions of the United<BR>Liberation Movement (ULIMO-J).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack occurred shortly after their arrival, as they were<BR>recording the state of security in the region. At the directive of the<BR>executive director of the Liberia Refugees Repatriation &amp; Resettlement<BR>Commission, Mrs. Weade Kobbah Wreh, they were beaten by her personal<BR>bodyguards and some ECOMOG soldiers. Flomoku's camera was destroyed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LIBREVILLE, Gabon (PANA) - As it was confirmed that 13 people had died of the deadly ' Ebola' virus in Gabon, the country's media organs have been urged to use local languages to spread the message on how the population can avoid infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The advise was given here Wednesday by a World Health Organization (WHO), Philippe Stroot from the Un health Agency's Media Relations section.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the Gabonese News Agency (AGP) that infection prevention messages in the vernaculars should be aired on provincial radio stations for easy reception by population in remote areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stroot was speaking on his return from Mayibout II in the north-eastern Gabon Ogooue-Ivindo Province, where 10 villagers were confirmed to have died of hemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola on Feb. 5 and 6, after eating a dead chimpanzee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stroot had visited the infected area in the company of two experts from the WHO, Bobacar Ndiaye and Dr. Maka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He commended Gabonese health authorities for the precautions they were taking to curb the further spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest report by the WHO said that 20 cases have been diagnosed.Out of these, 13 people had died. Among them was a six-month old baby who was infected by her mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to WHO experts, no new fresh cases had been diagnosed after the virus's incubation period, which is between two and 21 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The existence of Ebola was confirmed Monday by Gabon's Health Minister, who quoted research findings by the Franceville-based International Medical Research Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A similar outbreak of the Ebola-caused hemorrhagic fever in neighbouring Zaire killed 283 people between April and July 1995 in the Central region of Bandundu.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - As a cost cutting measure, the Zimbabwean health ministry has decided to remove kidney patients who are HIV-positive or have Hepatitis B from the renal programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Announcing this last Friday, Health and Child Welfare Minister timothy Stamps said said new patients would not be admitted to the programme until sustainable funds were available.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have taken a hard decision and decided to exclude any patient who is HIV positive or has Hepatitis B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will also not be admitting new patients until sustainable funds are available,&quot; he said in a speech at Mpilo hospital in the South Western Matebeleland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stamps told senior government officials and kidney patients that the decision was with immediate effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting was called by Makokoba member of parliament Sithembiso Nyoni whose constituency covers Mpilo hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He convened the meeting after being informed that the hospital's renal unit was deprived, for two weeks, of haemodialysis concentrate solution, a special drug used during dialysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stamps told the patients, some of whom have resorted to selling their cattle and clothes to buy medication, that the situation had not yet reached crisis proportions and the renal programme would not be abandoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bulawayo-based Orap-Zenzele clinic donated 100 litres of dialysis concentrate while five doctors from the city donated zd 3,000 (IUSD=9.058zd) for buying more medication for the kidney patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe health sector has been among the most affected in the cost-cutting measures introduced under the country's Structural djustment Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The budget cuts have forced hospitals to ask relatives of patients to buy the prescribed medicine and to feed the inpatients.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The Netherlands government Wednesday granted Zambia some USD 11 million for the importation of essential medical drugs during the next four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the agreement signed in Lusaka Wednesday by the two governments, the funds will enable the Zambian government procure a variety of essential drugs, mainly those against common diseases which afflict the rural populations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's National Commission for Development Planning deputy minister, Danny Pule, signed for his country, saying the funds would enable his government redirect limited resources to other needy sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Netherlands ambassador to Zambia Jan Peter Dijkstra, who signed for his government, said Zambia's reforms in the pharmaceutical sector had been lagging behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He disclosed that a coordinator had been assigned with the task of coodinating the process intended to result in a draft pharmaceutical policy for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dijkstra said under the agreement, some of the money would be used for technical assistance and the rest for the supply of drugs to rural health centres, including support for community health workers up to the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Zambia was one of the first countries in the Southern African region that had seriously shifted the focus on health services to the district level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On average, the Netherlands government has recently spent some USD 8 million per year to support the health sector in Zambia. The assistance has covered the payment of Dutch doctors in the country and the purchase of esssential drugs for rural health and community health workers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organization, which spearheaded the campaign, said that all the cases and deaths occured around the port city of Buchanan in Grand Bassa County.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the WHO, the campaign, which was launched in late November 1995,&quot;has succeeded in vaccinating 1 million people in the wartorn West African country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nearly 80 percent of the original target of 1.3 million people have now been vaccinated, including refugees, out of a total national population of 2.4 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign was &quot;the largest emergency vaccination campaign against the disease,&quot; said the United Nations health Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, according to Dr Fabrizio Bassani, director of WHO's Division of Emergency and Human Action (EHA), &quot; in a number of areas, access had to be negotiated in order for the vaccination teams to do their work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the WHO, there have been no confirmed cases in Monrovia, the capital although the city's population has swelled to three times its pre-war level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, as precaution, from Dec. 21 to 5 January, more than 600,000 of Monrovia's residents and the refugees were vaccinated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency said poor water and sanitation provide &quot;fertile conditions for the Aedes Aegypti mosquito which spreads the disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The majority of Zimbabwean children whose parents died of AIDS are facing severe economic problems and many of them have resorted to begging for food and other needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairperson of Emakhandeni home-based care group, Evelyn Magonya, told ZIANA in Bulwayo, the country's second city, that the situation was particularly desperate for children both of whose parents succumbed to the pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revival of Hope, an organisation that looks after children whose parents died of AIDS had by the end of 1995 identified over 500 orphans in two low-income suburbs in Bulawayo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health experts estimate that countrywide over 300 people were dying of AIDS every week in Zimbabwe, creating a frighteningly high orphan population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is estimated that one million people in Zimbabwe live with the Human Immunedeficiency virus (HIV) which causes the incurable Acquired Immunedeficiency Syndrome or AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Magonya, who appealed for assistance, said the children were suffering silently due to the harsh economic environment as most of them were being forced to drop out of school, ending up on the streets begging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The situation is now desperate. The department of social welfare says it has no money to help out,&quot; lamented Magonya, after a visit to some of the affected children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the family of five orphans aged between four and 13 years, now being looked after by an unemployed 92 year old grandmother, had virtually no food in the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three of the orphans have been forced to abandon school because their fees had not been paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sipathisiwe Mhlanga, the 14-year eldest child said since the death of both parents the family had been surviving on handouts from individuals and churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Magonya said social welfare efforts were being overwhelmed by the increase in aids orphans, most of whom were of school-going age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The general high cost of living is making it difficult for home-based care groups to assist these children. Their future is now doomed because they cannot even go to school or fend for themselves,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Lymphatic diseases have prevented Mashala Kalogi, a peasant in Tanzania's Mwanza region, from wearing trousers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For two decades, Kalogi has been suffering from elephantiasis or gross swelling of both legs and hydrocoele or grotesque enlargement of the male scrotum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kalogi is a famous paddy grower who lives in village near one of the most mosquito-infested shores of Lake Victoria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is just one of the 106 million people who are afflicted by those diseases, identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as &quot;the world's second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the United Nations health agency, the mosquito-borne diseases have already infected &quot;a minimum of 120 million people in 73 endemic countries worldwide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Africa, only Algeria, Botswana, Lesotho, Libya, Namibia, Morocco, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tunisia and Western Sahara are free from the infectious diseases, according to a map provided by the WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO says the prevalence of these diseases is growing due &quot;to rapid unplanned urbanization in many endemic countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lymphatic filariasis is caused by three types of filarial parasites--Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori-- which are transmitted to humans by mosquitos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mosquitos transmit them in the form of adult worms or microfiliarae which settle into the human lymphatic system and mature over a period of three to 15 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When fertilised, female adults produce large numbers of microfiliarae which are then ingested by mosquitos and transmitted to other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If not eliminated, the majority of microfiliare remain in the body in immature forms for six to two years &quot;moving, secreting, excreting and dying as foreign bodies, and doing immense damage to the host in the process,&quot; says the WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elephantiasis and hydrocoele occur when the macrofiliarae become longer and damage the lymphatic glands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the health UN agency's Task Force for Disease Eradication has already placed lymphatic filariasis as one of the world's six ' eradicable' or ' potentially eradicable' infections diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent document, the WHO said the transmission of filarial infection can be reduced by the selective treatement of of people who actually have the disease with the drug ' Ivermectin' .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said that an optimal single dose of ivermectin plus diethylcarbamazine (DEC) results in 99 percent reduction of microfilaraemia after one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, this treatment should be accompanied by effective measures to control the mosquito vector by using insecticide-impregnated bednets and curtains, long-lasting indorr sprays &quot;and community participation in vector management.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO regretted the &quot;low priority often accorded filariasis by health authorities&quot; and suggested its integration into other health care delivery packages.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - The secretariat charged with implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity has moved to Montreal, Canada, following a decision taken by governments in Jakarta, in November 1995, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UNEP statement said here Monday the Executive Secretary, Calestous Jumo of Kenya and a staff of 21 professionals will service the treaty and its 140 member governments from the new headquarters at Montreal's World Trade Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Thanks to strong support from the city of Montreal, the Province of Quebec, the government of Canada, and UNEP in Nairobi, we are already operational,&quot; Juma said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This spirit of cooperation will be invaluable to us as we carry out our ambitious work programme in the months and years ahead,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the secretariat's first tasks will be to prepare for the next session of the subsidiary body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA), to be held from September 2-6 in Montreal, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting will assess the factual information that governments will need for making policy decisions at the third annual session of the conference of the parties to the Convention, which will take place in Buenos Aires from November 4-5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release said the work programme for 1996 includes research on the safe transfer, handling, and use of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Governments agreed last year to start drafting a protocol on biosafety that would help to minimize potential risks from both accidental releases and trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next meeting on the subject will be held in Aarhus, Denmark, from July 22-26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Work will also begin on the publication of a global biodiversity outlook, a series of in-depth reports on the implications of the convention for key sectors, such as agriculture and marine and coastal areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another important focus this year will be indigenous and local knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The convention recognizes the special role that indigenous and local communities play in the protection and sustainable use of bioldiversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biological diversity refers to the number and variety of living oganisms on the planet. Recent estimates suggest that the earth is host to between 13 million and 14 million species, of which only 1.75 million have been scientifically described.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These species and the ecosystems they form are being destroyed at an unprecedented rate, primarily by human activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recognizing the immense value of the earth's biological resources, governments negotiated the convention on biological diversity ahead of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 139 countries have become party to the treaty as of February 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The convention's objectives are &quot;the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arishing out of the utilization of genetic resources&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has endorsed Senegalese government plans to construct a road through the Niokolo Koba national park, a ' world heritage' .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 165-kilometer road between Dialakoto and Kedougou, in the eastern Tambacounda region, is to be inaugurated by President Abdou Diouf on Feb. 29.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Endorsing the project, UNESCO however asked the government to meet several pre-conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of them requires Dakar to establish 40-meter wide fire breaks on both sides of the road, before it is open to traffick. This is to guard against bushfires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN agency also asked the government to rehabilitate the land around along the road to allow for afforestation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also demanded that game rangers be provided with adequate equipment to enable them curb poaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNESCO has designated several sites around the globe considered important to the whole of humanity part of the ' world heritage' .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers here believe UNESCO made these concessions to Senegal because of the proposed road's local and regional importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The road serves as a vital link to the major cotton growing southern Senegal and with the neighbouring states of Guinea and Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because the road passes through a rainy area with fragile soils, a series of drainage systems have to be established to prevent soil erosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The road is expected to cost 20 billion F CFA. The funding is to be provided by the government and several international financial institutions including the Saudi Development Fund, the Kuwaiti Fund, the Islamic Development Bank, the West African Development Bank and the Ecowas Fund.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MONROVIA, Liberia (PANA) - Six years of civil war is threatening Liberia with serious deforestation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prior to the war, which started in Dec. 1989, 80 percent of Liberia was covered by forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The indiscriminate felling of trees for sale, started in earnest by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia, followed by the Liberia Peace Council, is now posing a serious threat to the country's forest reserves.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prior to 1992, when the NPFL controlled 98 percent of Liberian territory, logging was one the mainstays of its economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The establishment of a Forestry Development Authority by the rebel government failed, however, to control logging by its officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By mid-1991, Liberian logs had flooded the French and other European markets. The glut led to a sharp drop in European timber prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NPLF's loss of several areas to the Liberian LPC in the south east and Ulimo in the west only exacerbated the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Realizing the immense profit they stood to gain from logging, the warlords in the two factions put their very souls into the dark enterprise.  Forest areas soon became the source of much fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, environmentalists began to voice their concerns. They noted that the felling of certain species would cause deforestation even in thickly forested areas. The warring factions, however, took little heed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Logging has to a large extent been restricted to the south east which is the most thickly forested region in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the war has resulted in the destruction of forests even in areas where logging is not possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western Liberia, which benefitted from a reforestation programme funded by the German Technical Assistance Programme (GTZ) has also borne the consequences of this breakdown of law and order. In Foya district, where hundreds of hectares of trees were cultivated under the scheme, bush fires caused by fighters searching for hidden valuables as well as fuelwood have sabotaged the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not much logging has gone on in the south eastern county of Bomi where a forestry training institute was in operation before the war, and where extensive reforestation was carried out under the German sponsored programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a flourishing charcoal industry has been a threat to the ecosystem in this region as well. Hundreds of citizens have become engaged in the trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charcoal production is a booming business even in the Monrovia area. The fact that 75 percent of the production sector is inactive due to the fragile security situation has resulted in the the trebbling of unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Self-employment has thus become the most reliable means of survival.  This has caused even educated residents to take to charcoal burning, an enterprise which does not require much capital outlay and has been traditionally looked at an occupation for the lowly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia's reconstruction programme after the war will require immense capital inputs to repair not only damaged infrastructure, but also restore the country's once huge forest reserves.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A biological control of weed in one of Zambia's most economically viable rivers, the Kafue, has been launched by the Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) in collaboration with the Commonwealth Science Council of London and the Plant Protection Research Institute (PPRI) in Pretoria, South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project is aimed at reducing the spread of the weed, water hyacinth, in the lower Kafue, southern Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambian environmental officials said in a recent report on the project that it had been observed that the weed reduced water quality, reduced fish catches by making the river less navigable, and had an adverse effect on the generation of hydro-electric power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambian government is currently rearing some weevils (weed-eating insects) imported from South Africa which are to be released on to the weed this month, according project leader, Israel Zandonda, a biologist with the ECZ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zandonda said in his report that the weed had some very serious consequencies and negative environmental impact on the river and that there were fears it could spread to other water basins in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Water hyacinth is said by scientists to have originated from Brazil and penetrated Africa through various water channels including the Suez Canal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECZ officials have said that native river weeds such as ' hippo grass&quot;, or ' vosnia' , and cyperus papyrus have now mixed with recently introduced foreign weed species, particularly the water hyacinth, a stud forming weed, resulting in the formation of large floating mats of weeds which sometimes became permanent floating islands on the river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the water scientists involved in the project, the weed's disadvantages include rapid loss of water by a process called &quot;evapotranspiration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scientists say that places covered by water hyacinth lose 46 percent more water than that lost by normal water surfaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The weed also makes the water &quot;tasteless&quot; for drinking purposes. It also changes the colour of water as it dies, rots, and sinks to the river bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This causes chemical treatment of drinking water from places covered by the stud-forming water hyacinth more expensive than normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts have said that it was possible that parts of, or the entire Kafueriver, could become blocked to traffic including speed-boats, canoes and even swimmers if the weed was left uncontrolled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kafue, one of Zambia three major rivers, along with the Luangwa and Zambezi, is a major source for commercial and domestic water and serves large concentrations of both fish and wildlife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are two major hydro-electric power stations on the river in central and southern Zambia. Electrical engineers at the stations are said to be encountering problems preventing the weed from being sucked into water turbines that generate electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's main electricity supplier, the Zambia Electricity Supply Corportation (ZESCO, recently set up an environmental division to deal with the weed problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Growth of the weed is thought by scientists to have escalated during the 1991/92 rain season when Zambia had its worst drought in living history.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MASVINGO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's largest inland dam, Lake Mutirikwi is now over 30 percent full and only needs about 60 million cubic metres of water to contain more water than any other dam within Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutirikwi had 426.2 million cubic metres of water as of February 12, representing 30.93 percent, but more water has since poured into the giant reservoir.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dam's water level is now only 12.86 metres below the spillway but experts say there is little chance the dam will spill this season as Zimbabwe's rain season is drawing to a close.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Uganda has accumulated over 440 million dollars in international rserves, the highest ever attained by the east African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reserves rose from 219 million dollars in June 1994 to 386 million in June 1995, the Governor of the (central) Bank of Uganda, Charles Kikonyogo told chief executives of commercial banks in Uganda at the weekend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the second annual dinner of the Institute of Bankers that the reserves kept in various international banks abroad were equivalent to about four months of the country's imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The performance of Uganda economy during the past year has been exceptionally strong&quot; Kikonyogo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All evidence suggests that the crown in national production has been well sustained in the current financial year. The rate of increase in domestic prices remains under control and the shilling is stable in terms of other currencies,&quot; he aadded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda was generally perceived by the international finance community as a country that has followed sensible economic policies and a model for other countries to emulate, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the governor warned that there was no room for complacency. &quot;Much remains to be done if the nation is to sustain and improve growth and stability&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kikonyogo said over time, banks must increase financing options open to borrowers saying the central bank's main obligation was to act in the interests of customers if the commercial banks were unable to meet minimum standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman of Uganda Bankers Assocation Ezra Suruma called for immediate reform in the banking sector saying banks should be privatized and capitalized to avoid unacceptability in the financial sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The public must be convinced that the banking system is safe and sound today, tomorrow and for decades to come&quot; said Suruma who is also the chief executive the giant Uganda Commercial Bank.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - South Africa's Department of Customs has rejected appeals by Zimbabwean shippers to rescind a decision to raise duties on transit cargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secretary for Zimbabwe's Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Kelbert Nkomani, said on Monday the South African Department of Customs had decided to implement the new measures with effect from March 1, despite appeals against the move by the Zimbabwe government and the Shipping and Forwarding Agents Association of Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other measures to control smuggling, the South African Department of Customs was demanding that exporters from such landlocked countries as Zimbabwe pay a cash deposit to cover 125 percent of the duty which would be payable if the goods in transit were imported into South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, the department said it would not accept road bonds as security for removal of goods in transit, and wanted all transit goods destined for other African countries by road to leave through the border posts of Beitbridge and Komatipoort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The implementation of the measures had been temporarily suspended until the beginning of this month, pending the outcome of negotiations with the affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it seems the talks broke down without agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are informed that the South African authorities have decided that the cash deposit to cover 125 percent of the duty payable will become a requirement with effect from March 1 1996,&quot; Nkomani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the duty would apply to textiles, clothing, electronic goods such as video recorders and televisions, tyres, wine, beer and cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Industry sources said the new measures could force Zimbabweans to divert their cargo to ports such as Beira and Maputo in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly 40 percent of Zimbabwean tobacco is now being exported through Beira.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - Winnie Mandela, the estranged wife of South African President Nelson Mandela is to visit Nigeria at the invitation of the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS), the official News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency said the invitation was given to her by the NCWS' president Amina Sambo, who visited South Africa recently.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAN quoted Sambo as saying Winnie, a member of the South African parliament, was &quot;excited&quot; about the visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Winnie last visited Nigeria four years ago with his husband shortly after he was released from 26 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sambo said Winnie, a South African woman activist had been invited because of &quot;her positive contribution to women's cause...and her support for Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The invitation is part of our networking program among African women organizations aimed at improving their lot and to develop a coordinated effort at articultaing women issues,&quot; Sambo added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said her trip to South Africa was at the invitation of South African women's group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian women's council, she said, had also been invited to the August 40th anniversary of South Africa's ruling African National Congress womens' wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was unclear how the planned visit would be taken in South Africa, which is locked in diplomatic row with the Nigerian government over the November 1995 executions of nine Nigerian minority leaders, among them author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to preliminary results issued here, only 45 per cent of those eligible voted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least 200,000 voters were expected to cast their ballots in the poll in which Monteiro was the sole candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the strong backing of the ruling Movement for Democracy (MPD), Monteiro campaigned on the theme he is &quot;President of all Cape Verdians&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He repeatedly called upon the islands' political parties to put aside electoral bickering and seek the national interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presidential election marked the end of a two-month electoral process, which started with parliamentary and municipal polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the legislative elections, the ruling MPD swept 50 of the 72 seats while the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV), formerly the sole party, got 21. One seat went to the Party for Democratic Convergence (PCD).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts attribute the fall to what they described as the &quot;socio-economic situation of the moment&quot;, in reference to the introduction of new higher denomination bank notes by the Kinshasa government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA)- The government-owned Times of Zambia newspaper's managing editor, Arthur Simuchoba, was sacked by his board of directors Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement from the holding company, Times Printpak Zambia Limited, gave no reason for the dismissal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company chairman, Ravi Devalia, said the company directors had at a meeting Monday &quot;unanimously resolved&quot; to sack Simuchoba on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simuchoba in September successfully filed an injuction to restrain the board from sacking him and has been acting managing editor since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has been replaced by Emmanuel Nyirenda, formerly managing editor of the government-owned Zambia Daily Mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the Times said Tuesday that they believed Simuchoba could have been sacked for his sometimes &quot;scathing&quot; editorials against the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government of President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simuchoba had recently, in one of his hard-hitting editorials, suggested that government was being naive by showing open fear for former president Kenneth Kaunda in this year's presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was commenting on the current constitutional controversy involving government's recommendation in the new constitution that only second-generation Zambians should be allowed to contest the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two weeks ago, Chiluba banned an edition of the independent Post daily newspaper which contained a story claiming the president had planned to call a snap referendum on selected constitutional clauses in a bid to catch the opposition unawares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post's three editors, including the paper's managing editor Fred M'membe, have since been charged with publishing &quot;classified material&quot; and possessing prohibited publications.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A Zimbabwean media consultant has proposed the formation of an African media diversity trust funds to facilitate public ownership of newspapers, currently monopolized by governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tawana Kupe, a consultant in the media and communication department at the University of Oslo in Norway, said this at a recent media management workshop in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that the media was in the Southern African sub-region in particular slowly being undermined by censorship and a weak economic base.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The media, Kupe said, was open to pressure from economic interests and had to sometimes practise self-censorship because of real and imagined fears of upsetting dominant economic interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kupe, who presented a paper on the &quot;Media and Democracy&quot; at the first media management course for journalists from Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe, said the proposed media diversity trust funds could be funded by governments, donors, foundations, private corporations and individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The money could also be used to fund new media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He observed that while a lot could be done in reorganizing the media to play its role more effectively, it was necessary for other institutions that impact on the media to restructure, reform and democratize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kupe expressed concern at the unethical decisions by media organizations in Africa who tend to push out editorial matter in order to accomodate advertisements so as to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Papers need advertising to survive but as the press becomes more commercialized information becomes less and less (important),&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Veteran Zimbabwean journalist William Saidi said at the same course that in the southern region, the ideal editor was a myth. He said most editors in the region were directed by governments of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said it was pathetic to find that some news editors actually conspired with their governments on what to publish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a tragedy to have a paper which always praises government.  Journalism in this region faces a big problem and editors are being killed slowly by government through pressure,&quot; Saidi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-week course sponsored by the NORDIC/Southern African Development Community Journalism Centre in Maputo, Mozambique, ran from January 29 to February 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also looked looked at gender in the newsroom, media law, and journalism ethics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's miliary ruler Gen. Sani Abacha and Cameroonian President Paul Biya are to meet in March to iron out their differences over the disputed oil-rich Bakassi peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian foreign ministry said the planned meeting came as a result of the mediatory talks held last week between the foreign ministers of both countries, Tom Ikimi of Nigeria and Ferdinand Oyono of Cameroon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those talks were held under the auspices of Togo President Gnassingbe Eyadema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ikimi and Oyono will meet in the first week of March to work out details for the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian foreign ministry said the planned summit was &quot;without prejudice&quot; to the ongoing process at the International Court of Justice in the Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hostilities between Cameroon and Nigeria began in 1981 and resumed in 1994 over the peninsula situated on the southern border separating the two countries. A meeting scheduled in that year between the two leaders was called off at the last minute without any reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then, Cameroon filed a complaint at the International Court. Nigeria responded in 1995 by filing preliminary objections to Cameroon's suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fresh hostilities broke out February 3, 1996 with both countries suffering military casualties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MBALE, Uganda (PANA) - Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has told rebels fighting his government in the north of the country to surrender or be wiped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a strong statement he made Monday at a public rally at Mbale, eastern Uganda, Museveni said the national army had already gained the capacity to wipe out the Lord's Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Uganda government, LRA rebels infiltrated northern Uganda from Sudan last Wednesday and attacked Prongo trading centre in Gulu district, killing 14 civilians and burning two trucks and scores of homes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebels, estimated at some 500, on Saturday again ambushed a civilian vehicle convoy headed for the capital, Kampala, from the northwestern West Nile region. The number of casualties was not disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government said in yet another battle between the Uganda People's Defence Forces and the rebels in Akalo-Chan, Lamogi division, 22 rebels were killed while three soldiers were seriously wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni said unlike in the past government troops were now highly mobile, making it easier for them to deal with the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Anybody who tries to bring insecurity into Uganda again will be wiped out on the battlefield or go to jail,&quot; Museveni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni, whose National Resistance Army (NRA) took over power in Kampala in January 1986, is expected to stand for his first election this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The polls are to be held under a &quot;no party system&quot; which bars aspirants from standing as representatives of political parties. They can stand as individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The electoral method, endorsed by a constituent assembly last year, has been criticized by opposition leaders as a trick by Museveni to easily win the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently, the country's major opposition parties -- the Uganda People's Congress and the Democratic Party -- chose Paul Kawanga Semogerere as their joint candidate to challenge Museveni.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - There was a lull in Lagos currency market at the weekend following the announcement last Friday of the country's budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Open market currency dealers better known here as the &quot;black market&quot;, had expected the 1996 budget to scrap the dual exchange rate of the local currency and the central bank window, the autonomous fereign exchange market (AFEM), because it had been affecting business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government in the 1995 budget reregulated the exchange rate of the naira by fixing its official exchange rate at 22 to the dollar. The central bank also introduced AFEM from which investors bought hard currency through bidding often more favurable than the prevailing rate in the parallel market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1996 budget maintained the status quo, thereby depriving currency dealers of possible spin-offs that would have resulted from a total liberalisation of the exchange rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between Friday and Monday, activitty on Braod Street, the &quot;Wall Street&quot; of Lagos, was dull with little movement in the value of currencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dollar which had rebounded in the market to 86 naira was static just like the Deutsch mark which continues to exchange for 57.50 naira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The British pound was in no better shape. Two days before the budget was released, it lost about 1.50 in trading, closing at 131 naira from 133 naira previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since last year, the money market has been affected by events in AFEM as rates of the hard currencies usually dropped after an intervention or build-up prior to the next intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since November when the Nigerian Central Bank regularised trading at its window, most foreign currency rates fell in the black market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, the naira gained in value from an aveage of 95 to one United States dollar to to an average of 85 to one greenback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In January, this rate dropped further to 84 after AFEM intervened for the first time in the new year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts attribute the fall to what they described as the &quot;socio-economic situation of the moment&quot;, in reference to the introduction of new higher denomination bank notes by the Kinshasa government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The S. African department of trade and industry says in a report obtained from its high commission in Harare that the country's exports to Zimbabwe were increasingly becoming important and should be taken seriously.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa expected its exports to African markets, especially Zimbabwe, to have climbed to 9.1 billion zimdollars (1 billion USD) in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe is South Africa's top African trading partner, and trade between the two countries shot up 40 percent between 1993 and 1994 and surged a further 45 percent during 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1994, Zimbabwe imported 6.5 billion ZIMDOLLARS (722 million USD) worth of products, exporting products worth only 2.6 billion ZIMDOLLARS (289 million USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report says South Africa's intra-African exports were mainly chemicals, base metals, processed foods, vegetable products, paper and board, textiles, animal products, mineral products, manufactured items like furniture, cement and instrumentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Partial lifting of exchange controls allowing South African companies to invest more freely in the region, and this was expected to further promote growth and trade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - World trade in goods which had fallen to an all-time low in 1993 grew 12.5 percent in 1994, the highest growth rate since 1990, according to International Monetary Fund balance of payment statistics year book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trade in services also increased in 1994 by 7.3 percent, but while this marked a sizeable gain for services trade, growth rate was well below that of 1990, when services trade grew by 20 percent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of 1994 increase in trade in goods and services was accounted for by industrial countries and developing nations in Asia and the western hemisphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Industrial countries posted a current account deficit of some 1,117 billion zimdollars (13 billion USD) and net capital inflows of about 387 billion zimdollars (43 billion USD) in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was in contrast to 1993, when these countries registered a current account surplus of about 180 billion zimdollars (20 billion USD), accompanied by net capital outflows of roughly equal amounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Developing countries and economies in transition saw their combined current account deficit narrow by 30 percent in 1994, while their net capital inflows slowed down considerably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IMF said the reversal between 1993 and 1994 from a surplus to a deficit in industrial countries' combined current account can be traced to current transfers and the income components of the balance of payments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The wheat market in Zimbabwe is expected to be liberalised by April this year, allowing for the first time the private sector to compete with the state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) to import the crop, producers said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chief Executive of the Zimbabwe Cereal Producers Association, Peter Wells, said the liberalisation of wheat marketing would benefit producers, although they would have wished the government allowed them to export the wheat as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Wheat marketing is to be further liberalised in April and the GMB will no longer have the sole right to import wheat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But because of the lead time, from ordering to delivery, the GMB will probably carry on importing wheat up to June or July when the private companies will be able to bring their own supplies,&quot; Wells said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said farmers expected agriculture minister Dennis Norman to make a major agricultural policy statement soon, which was expected to include more details on liberalising agricultural marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has, however, made it clear it would not allow export of wheat until national requirements have been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wheat growers have been urging government to completely liberalise wheat marketing, as has been done with the coffee crop, which led to the formation of a privately-owned processing company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are concerned that the liberalisation applies to imports and not exports as it puts producers at a disadvantage.  otherwise, I think it will benefit the industry,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wells, meanwhile, said up to 200,000 tonnes of wheat was expected to be imported this year to meet domestic shortfalls caused by reduced production during 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wells said the GMB had been importing about 25,000 tonnes of wheat per month since the programme started last year, and supplies had come from as far as the United States, Australia and India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The GMB on Monday announced it would soon go to tender for the importation of another consignment of wheat, but did not say how much it wanted to procure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Output in 1995 was estimated at 85,000 tonnes compared with the 288,000 tonnes produced from 52,000 hectares in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwean wheat is usually grown during the winter months using irrigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wells said indications were that production this year would increase, mainly as a result of improved water supplies following above normal rains during the 1995/96 season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unrestricted national demand, once estimated at 400,000 tonnes a year, has been revised to between 325,000 and 350,000 tonnes, following the decontrol of bread and flour prices in line with the government's market reforms launched in 1990.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Horticulture Promotion Council chief executive Stanley Heri said in an interview that despite the heavy rains which damaged some of the flowers, the 1995/96 season had been good and exports were on target.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Damage from the rains was very minimal and according to our export projections, we are on target. Fresh produce has been excellent due to the good weather,&quot; Heri said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the current season, the Council plans to export 12,300 tonnes of flowers compared to 9,200 tonnes the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between July last year and January this year, 6,233 tonnes of flowers had been exported, Heri said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the 1994/95 season, 8,000 tonnes of fruit and vegetables were exported and 11,685 tonnes were expected to be exported by the end of June this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of January 1996, 6,000 tonnes had been exported since July last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earnings from flower and fresh produce exports in the 1994/95 season were 675 million zimdollars (75 million USD) and this was expected to reach 900 million zimdollars (100 million USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe is Africa's second largest exporter of flowers and fresh horticultural produce, and was increasingly strengthening its position in Europe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Uganda has accumulated over 440 million dollars in foreign reserves, the highest ever attained by the east African country in many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reserves rose from 219 million dollars in June 1994 to 386 million in June 1995, the Governor of the (central) Bank of Uganda, Charles Kikonyogo told chief executives of commercial banks in Uganda at the weekend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the second annual dinner of the Institute of Bankers that the reserves kept in various foreign banks were equivalent to about four months of the country's imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The performance of the Ugandan economy during the past year has been exceptionally strong&quot; Kikonyogo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All evidence suggests that the crown in national production has been well sustained in the current financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Domestic prices remain under control and the shilling is stable in terms of other currencies,&quot; he aadded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda was generally perceived by the international finance community as a country that has followed sensible economic policies and a model for other countries to emulate, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the governor warned that there was no room for complacency. &quot;Much remains to be done if the nation is to sustain and improve growth and stability&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kikonyogo said over time, banks must increase financing options open to borrowers saying the central bank's main obligation was to act in the interest of customers if the commercial banks were unable to meet minimum standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman of Uganda Bankers Assocation, Ezra Suruma, called for immediate reform in the banking sector saying banks should be privatised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The public must be convinced that the banking systen is safe and sound today, tomorrow and for decades to come&quot; Suruma who is the chief execuitive the giant Uganda Commercial Bank, told bankers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - There have been mixed reactions to Nigeria's 1996 budget released last Thursday by military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some key business captains commend the seemingly liberal monetary policies it introduced while others say there were doubts on how they would be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayode Familoni, an economics consultant at the University of Lagos, is among those who support the government's decision to &quot;consolidate&quot; the gains of the fiscal and monetary policies of 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he suggests a fine-tuning of the policies &quot;to match existing realities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some financial operators are however, adopting a a wait-and-see attitude to the budget, which maintains a 1995 ceiling of 21 percent on interest rate and a dual foreign exchange rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 22 naira to the dollar rate is strictly for government transactions, while the currency floats at a rate of between 80 and 85 naira to the greenback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Familoni said the 1995 inflation rate estimated at 80 percent by the Central Bank of Nigeria, coupled with the existing lending rate resulted in &quot;negative real rate, and this in the long run, will discourage savings and investment in the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 125 billion naira or 5.68 billion dollars budget, is predicated on oil sales at the price of 16 dollars per barrel for fiscal 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil accounts for more than 80 percent of Nigeria's total foreign exchange earnings and the country currently lifts some two million barrels of crude daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, some economists say basing the budget on oil price of 16-dollar-a-barrel appears too &quot;ambitious,&quot; pointing out that the 15 dollars for a barrel on which the 1995 budget was based would have been ideal, given the unstable international oil market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A former Nigerian finance minister, Onaolapo Soleye, has dismissed the budget as &quot;vague and empty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soleye, minister during the 20-month military regime of Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, claimed the 1996 budget was silent on how to reduce poverty in the populous west African country of some 100 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha had announced tax relief and employment generation as some &quot;poverty alleviation&quot; measures in the budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Soleye argued that the budget did not elaborate on how to arrest run-away inflation, which aggravates poverty in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), michael Oladeinde, also picked a hole in the government's proposed measures against &quot;double-taxation&quot; imposed on companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said lack of clarity on the issue and the setting up of panels to punish economic saboteurs, was a &quot;delay tactic&quot;, and could continue to hinder economic growth in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, many industrialists, including Erastus Akingbola of the Nigerian International Merchant Bank, have praised the consistency in the 1996 budget, which they consider a welcome departure from previous budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Akingbola said government deserved praise, especially for retaining key aspects of the &quot;guided deregulation&quot; policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christopher Kolade, chairman of Cadbury Nigeria Plc, a leading foods and beverages retail outlet, also expressed happiness there was no &quot;reversal of the positive moves made last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But like most other economic operators, Kolade feels it is too early to judge the estimates, warning that implementation remains a key factor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team is in Zambia for consultations with government officials before Lusaka starts to draw from the fund's new Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team, led by the IMF director for Africa, Ekis Calamatis, is on a regular two-week annual consultation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia in 1995 qualified to borrow under the more favourable ESAF after successfully executing a three-year Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambian officials have expressed confidence that under ESAF, with its low 0.5 percent interest rates and longer repayment periods, the country could achieve an estimated six per cent annual growth rate from this year up to 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Paris Club donor community in December gave Zambia some USD 850 million aid under ESAF terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The donors have said that Zambia needs to complement economic development efforts with improvements in the quality of life for its nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambian officials have acknowledged that about 70 percent of the country's nine million people are poor and that life expectancy is down to an all-time low of 40 years while the infant mortality has seen an upward spiral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About one third of Zambia's 1996 budget, presented by finance minister Ronald Penza in January, has been financed by donors. Penza said that about two thirds on this year's capital expenditure would go to areas intended to stimulate economic growth and the social sector, to help improve the living standards of the poor majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister is next week expected to leave for Paris for further consultations on the country's USD 850 milllion loan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - The highly respected human rights figure and former chief of staff to Martin Luther King, Jr. in the early 1960's, Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker, was elected President of the American Committee on Africa (AC0A) at a recent Board Meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Walker is the Senior Pastor of the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ in New York's Harlem Community. His Presidency will significantly strengthen the efforts of the American Committee on Africa for human rights and justice at a time when there is an immense attack on programs for the poor in the U.S. and on development assistance for correcting centuries of injustices in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The American Committee on Africa was formed to support the struggle for African freedom and self determination in 1953, at a time when there were only four independent African countries. Forty three years later, it continues to mobilize Americans on behalf of justice for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On accepting his new position as President, Dr. Walker indicated that &quot;the assaults on the poor by the right wing radical leaders in our country is a travesty to the ideals of freedom, justice and democracy our people have been struggling for historically; this is true here in the U.S. as in Africa, where liberation and democratic successes are more and more overshadowed with social and economic injustices. Nevertheless, we are determined to wage our struggle for justice forever forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In April 1994, he led a Religious Action Network delegation to South Africa to observe the historic all-race election to end apartheid and returned a month later as an invited guest to celebrate the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as the first President of a free and democratic South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Walker's book, &quot;Soweto Diary&quot; gives an account of his experience during the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Secretary General of the Religious Action Network, Wyatt Tee Walker addressed national and international gatherings, including the U.S. Congress and the United Nations on human rights, economic justice and development issues concerning Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - When it comes to any visiting cricketer's diet on the sub-continent, it is generally a case of forewarned is forearmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stories of the debilitating effect of &quot;Delhi belly&quot; and &quot;Bombay bug&quot; are legion in both Test and one-day international cricket and many a player touring this part of the world has had to settle for run-accumulation of the erratic kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few years ago an English agency journalist (who shall remain nameless) became such a victim and had to rely on his initiative while covering a Test series in India. Spending most of his time during the hours of play firmly rooted to the &quot;gents&quot;, he arranged for a television to be placed in his line of sight and was then able to deliver accurate, running copy of the reliable kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To date, the 1996 World Cup has been no exception and several players have fallen victim to one or other virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seven members of the Netherlands side were laid low after eating spaghetti bolognaise in Baroda on the eve of their tournament opener against New Zealand, and Australians Shane Warne and Ricky Ponting had to miss a few training sessions in Bombay with upset stomachs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surprisingly, even one of the home countries was affected when Indian leg-spinner Anil Kumble contracted viral fever and came close to missing his side's victory over Kenya at Cuttack on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet one side which has not been affected during their time in Pakistan is South Africa. This can be attributed to their astute, scientific preparation and the meticulous monitoring by the team fitness specialist Paddy Upton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the risk of stating the obvious, it's no good having a team that's extremely fit and perhaps the best batting or fielding team in the world if the guys are sick,&quot; Upton says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to give everyone the best possible opportunity of performing at their optimum and, to keep the guys away from 'Delhi belly', we have prepared from a long way out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Upton foucuses on two measures that can be taken to prevent the cricketer's nightmare on the sub-continent. &quot;First of all, the guys in our team twice a week take a broad spectrum antibiotic to prevent it. Then the other method of prevention that we use is probably one of our strongest weapons against it -- and that's education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A year ago when the guys were first introduced to a way of eating in terms of a diet for weight maintenance -- be it for loss or gain -- and also for performance, I found I was needing to prescribe meals for the whole team.  But now, instead of prescribing, I've more facilitated and educated them so they can sit down and pretty much know exactly what they should be ordering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As all visitors to the East know only too clearly, the water is usually the common denominator with &quot;Delhi belly&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Obviously the water is a bug danger,&quot; Upton says. &quot;There is a lot of virus in the water here and we try to stay away from it as much as possible.  The players brush their teeth with bottled water and in the shower, and even with general horse-play in the swimming pool, they are very aware of not swallowing the water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Also, with fresh vegetables and lettuces which have been washed in water, the guys stay away from that. Normally, fresh vegetables and fruit are good for you but here we only eat fruit where you have to peel the skin off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When it comes to the question of food and what to eat, Upton keeps everything simple and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> logical: &quot;The guys tend to avoid food where you can't really see what you are eating, and the favourites there are 'chicken a la king' where old chickens can be used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A few of the guys have eaten spaghetti bolognaise, but I think that's also a pretty dodgy one because old meat can be used and pretty much anything can be chopped up to look like bolognaise. But, with a piece of meat or a piece of chicken, you can actually see what you're eating and that can't really be doctored in any way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Then again the guys know that the number one food type they should be eating is carbohydrates -- which is your rices and breads -- and it is very difficult to get ill from eating that type of food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of Upton's stringent preparation of the team food relates to match days. &quot;On match days, the meals have been prescribed before we even arrive at the ground. Menus went out to the hotels so we know exactly what goes into them. And all the food at the ground is catered by the hotels that we're stayng at, so we have plenty of time ahead of the match to chat with the food and beverage managers about what they're going to prepare and how they are going to prepare it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We stay away from oils and fats on a playing day because that can impare performance or it impares the body from getting to the carbohydrates which is really your energy food. We also discuss things like spices for chicken curry and how hot it must be. All the hotels in Pakistan have so far been really good in that respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Upton says, there is so much that can be done to educate the cricketer, but it is then up to him to call the shots: &quot;The guys must then be able to choose for themselves. We've gone through every scenario where you can pick up Delhi belly or eat inappropriately and the guys in the team are all 100 percent aware of that and are on the lookout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Intriguingly, Upton believes the local cuisine on the sub-continet is often a better alternative than Western food: &quot;As long as the guys are eating in the top restaurants and the top hotels, the Pakistan dishes are often the best bet. But to eat from a corner cafe or a side-street cook-up is courting danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the players can see what they are eating, and it's not a minced up dish but a chicken dish or a chicken curry -- one of the specialities of the country -- in a lot of places that's probably safer than the Western option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With Western food, they're bound to be less familiar with its cooking, and because of that, the food sits in the fridge for longer and it might be re-used the next day. Then, on the other hand, the traditional dishes are being served up all the time and hsould be a lot safer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although South Africa are only a couple of weeks into their World Cup journey, the Upton philosophy of safe eating and fitness maintenance has been a resounding success. Not only are South Africa considered to be the fittest side at the World Cup, but their collective bill of health has been remarkably clean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There have been no problems so far,&quot; Upton admits, &quot;and we very affectionately and jokingly call Tim Noakes (the team doctor) Doctor Dolittle because we haven't had many illnesses or many patienst to take care of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A few of the guys have had a few sniffles but nothinbg serious.  Everything's been tidy so far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the secret to continued success lies in Upton's preparation, then that should remain the situation for the rest of South Africa's journey through the sub-continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The cola wars are lighting up Johannesburg, providing a new landmark and much pleasure for the city's bugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new 15m-high sign on top of Hillbrow's Ponte building -- the largest and tallest in Africa -- is attracting the attention of passers-by and insects. Tenants say the lighting is attracting swarms of night-time bugs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After several attempts by Ponte management to lure companies to advertise on top of the 12- year-old residential block, Coca-Cola recently took the gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Pepsi was also approached by Ponte, their advertising agency felt that the sign was an unnecessary tactic in the cola war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We were approached before Coke, but decided not to use the space as we felt that Coke needed the exposure more than we did,&quot; said David Haley, media group head at Saatchi and Saatchi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pepsi, although reluctant to reveal details on how it would counteract the sign, said that it had &quot;something in the pipeline&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sign, equivalent to a five-storey building, was installed by Johannesburg-based Natanya signs. Work began on the sign at the beginning of the Rugby World Cup last year and it was lit up at the close of the Africa Cup of Nations on February 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lights are switched on every day from 5:30 pm until 5 am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a total weight of 6,4 tons, the neon sign consists of 20km of neon glass (84 000m of white neon and 12 3 000m of red neon). Manufacturers of this glass spent almost two months making the 4 250 individual neon units with 21 000m of wiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most residents spoken to at Ponte City this week said they don't really mind that the top of their building now looks like a beacon for incoming air traffic. But the bright lights has also attracted a few unwelcomed visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although most of the residents said they were happy with the sign, Jerry Kae, a tenant said that although the sign gave the building a different look, especially at night, it did attract swarms of insects which started to annoy some of the residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a tenant who lives in the penthouse said that unless it is cloudy the sign does not reflect into his home. &quot;However when it is misty the the combination of the red from the sign and the white of the clouds transforms the place into a pink palace.&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lebonetse Baloyi, who moved into the building at the start of construction, said he welcomed the sign but was annoyed that the construction company did not remove any of the rubble generated during construction of the sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to recent statistics from Coca-Cola, South Africans consume at least 50 Coca-Colas every second throughout the year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - First, there is the annual budget, in which government spells out its expenditure and revenue targets for the next year. But, running parallel to this is the Reconstruction and Development Programme Fund, which also makes allocations to various departments to build clinics or feed schoolchildren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When departments find they are running out of money before the end of the financial year in March, they ask for additional funds, which are approved in the Adjustments Appropriation Bill. This bill also details those departments that have not been able to spend all their money for the year and need to get permission to roll it over to the next year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African National Congress MP Barbara Hogan told the committee she found it &quot;very difficult&quot; to keep track of exactly what government was spending.  The sooner the government moved on to multi-year budgets under a medium-term expenditure plan, the better the committee would be able to do its job of being the nation's budget watchdog, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee was drafting its report on the Adjustments Estimates Bill and the issue of roll-over funds was of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The principle of allowing departments to roll-over funds not spent in one year to another was introduced in 1993/94 to prevent departments from going on a spending spree at the end of each financial year if all funds were not used up. The roll-over funds cannot be spent on recurrent expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year, the roll-over funds have almost doubled to R6,9-billion and Hogan said this made it difficult to assess the budget allocations properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Defence's roll-over was a sizeable R1,2-billion but, Hogan said, there was no indication whether this was because it had ear-marked the money for a long-term project that had not yet got off the ground. Thus the need for multi-year budgets to give a clearer picture of what is happening.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The plush Hyde Park offices of the World Bank in Johannesburg are more in keeping with a corporate bank than an organisation dedicated to alleviating poverty. And that dichotomy is reflected in the bank's role in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa last borrowed money in late 1993, from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and since then has followed a strict no-loans policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judith Edstrom, the new resident representative of the bank in South Africa, says the government's position is clear. Organisations such as the bank, the IMF and African Development Bank are held at arm's length, encouraged only to play an advisory role. But as she says, a lending relationship is not imperative. Indeed, as South Africa is classified as a middle-income country, it does not qualify for the World Bank's favourable interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More importantly, the government does not want to send out the wrong political signals -- borrowing from the World Bank would, for one, indicate a freer spending policy, with concomitant reverberations around the financial markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank is not a popular institution in Africa; even supporters of unbridled capitalism have reservations about the impact of its structural adjustment policies on developing communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Edstrom admits mistakes were made; safety nets for the poorest were not always in place -- nor very effective. But she cautions against blaming structural adjustment per se; it has become a catch-phrase covering every bank initiative that ever went wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been successful policies, however, particularly in education and health -- of particular interest to Edstrom, who spent five years working for Unicef in Kenya. And it is in these areas, as well as on the bigger, infrastructure projects, that the bank's international experience is of value to the South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a dyed-in-the-wool World Banker, she believes in market-oriented development; on that score, the bank has no reason to be unhappy. Indeed, South Africa is seen as something of a success story; the extent of the Bank's collaboration at government level is significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Edstrom points to the informal channels of discussion with politicians and government institutions on the whole gamut of development issues, from primary health care to regional trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is still a huge need for aid agencies, as well as non-government organisations, and part of her job is to act as interlocutor between the various bodies. She emphasises their complementary r_les; being more specialised they cater to niche markets while, by virtue of the sheer size of its operations, the World Bank is often seen as blundering around like a &quot;big elephant&quot;, especially at grass-roots level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the bank's new head, James Wolfensohn, such collaborative relationships are actively encouraged. It worked in Vietnam, where non- financial support was provided for up to six years before a lending programme was signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the bank is not known for its altruism. So how long can it continue offering technical assistance and development advice with no pay- back? As long as it takes, says Edstrom. It's not as if the government has issued an unequivocal &quot;no&quot; to any prospect of borrowing; it is merely considering its options. And as long as that advice is appreciated, the World Bank is happy to stay.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Three industrial projects -- still just a glimmer in the eye -- may be built in Maputo, if the R1-billion infrastructural corridor project to improve road and rail links between South Africa and Mozambique is successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Primary aluminium producer Alusaf may consider building a second smelter in Maputo as part of its long-term strategic planning. &quot;The temptation would be to use power from Cahora Bassa,&quot; says managing director Rob Barbour, adding that it is still just a concept.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company is busy commissioning its R5- billion double-size smelter plant in Richards Bay with a production capacity of 460 000 tons. The first smelter was commissioned in December 1995 and completion of the second phase is expected by July this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barbour says other international companies had looked at the Maputo option before but rejected it because of the lack of infrastructure. &quot;Now, hopefully this won't be such a big factor in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two other projects, still under discussion, both involve state-owned Foskor and the international fertiliser market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first fertiliser project concerns Indian company Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation (Spic), expected to arrive in South Africa within a fortnight to evaluate building a plant in Maputo to process phosphate rock, mined by Foskor, into phosphoric acid for supply to India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foskor managing director Danie Vorster says interest has been expressed by certain companies in India to establish a phosphoric acid project in Maputo based on phosphate rock from Phalaborwa. &quot;It is possible that Spic is part of such a consortium but we have not had a direct approach from Spic in this regard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the company had previously had discussions with Spic about the possible supply of phosphate rock to its facilities in India, but to date no real interest has been shown on their part for such a supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foskor's phosphate rock is of a high grade and some 25% of production is railed to Indian Ocean Fertilisers in Richards Bay -- jointly owned by Foskor and the Togolese government - -- both for beneficiation and export.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the project in Maputo got the go-ahead, it is likely that the company would increase its production as its reserves are believed to be enormous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two options for transporting the rock to Maputo could be considered: one involves the building of a slurry pipe to transport the rock but this is dodgy because of the general shortage of water in the area. The second option would be to rail the rock, and this could be facilitated by the plan to build an artery off the main development corridor from Witbank to Maputo up into the Tzaneen region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At present, there are no pipeline facilities for the delivery of rock to Maputo and phosphate rock is not exported via Maputo by Foskor,&quot; says Vorster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the second proposal, Maputo is being considered as a second option only. It involves a large fertiliser complex being built in Richards Bay with players Sasol, Phalaborwa-based Foskor and Norwegian company Hydro Agri each bringing their competitive advantage to the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sasol would supply gas from Secunda, Foskor would provide the phosphate rock and Hydro Agri would supply its marketing network in the international fertiliser market. &quot;As an option, other sites such as Maputo could be considered because it is closer to Phalaborwa,&quot; says an industry source.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The top-down approach by governments and development agencies in dealing with rural poverty came under attack this week at the first regional conference to deal with the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Katherine Marshall, World Bank director in charge of the region, asked whether southern African governments were relying on rhetoric rather than real action on the ground to deal with the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Fawzi Hamad Al- Sultan, warned that this could be a short- sighted approach as it was contributing to the endless migration of poor people from rural to urban areas. &quot;It is the lack of opportunity in the countryside that pushes the migrants out, adding to urban unemployment and straining urban civic services to breaking point,&quot; Al- Sultan said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Poverty is increasing but we know we have the knowledge and the means to end it ... if we fail, the poor will tell us themselves and if we wait too long, their judgement will not be gentle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marshall said that in South Africa, 81% of the poorest people live in rural areas; in Lesotho, the figure is 91%, in Malawi 95%, in Zambia 76% and in Zimbabwe 92%. &quot;The gap between the rich and the poor may be wider in this region of the world than in any other,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She attributed this to the persistence of barriers bred in colonial times that still blocked the rural poor's access to fertile land and resources, as well as their isolation from major markets and poor access to social services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both she and Al-Sultan believe the answer lies in a more sustainable programme to make small- scale farming productive; and improved infrastructure and social services. Opening the workshop, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said an integrated process was needed that took all these factors into account, plus skills development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All speakers, however, stressed the need to &quot;hear the voices of the poor&quot; and involve them in all planning and implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marshall said the poor could not continue to be &quot;passive actors&quot; in their development if attempts to improve their lot were to succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This could be more costly and time-consuming than &quot;old ways of doing business, but it is the only way of guaranteeing that our efforts are effective and successful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a representative of the World Bank, Marshall talked about the need for macro- economic balance and especially the need to ensure that the &quot;myths&quot; surrounding the kinds of painful structural adjustment programmes undertaken by many countries in the region did not undermine political leaders and development programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As economic growth begins to return to southern Africa, we need to turn our attention to the more difficult policy issues by focusing on the quality of that economic growth ... to ensure that the poor are not bypassed, so ensuring they are not treated as some sort of economic afterthought,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Amid all the fuss about what to do with state assets, does the improved performance of South Africa's public enterprises make it easier or more difficult to privatise them? It is, as information service group BusinessMap points out, a &quot;double-edged sword&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Privatising these assets -- or in government-speak, &quot;restructuring these assets&quot; -- becomes less attractive to government the better they perform. Why get rid of something good and potentially lucrative both financially and politically? The unions are particularly sensitive about this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, on the other hand, the assets become more valuable and thus realise greater proceeds from any sale. Indeed, a primary objective of these enterprises over the past few years has been to make them commercially viable for any future investor. In this regard, government can talk about success.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consider Transnet, Eskom and Denel, by far the three largest public enterprises (Telkom and the Post Office are structured differently with the state their sole shareholder. they do not fall under the ministry of Public Enterprises).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transnet, the state-owned transport group, operates South African Airways (SAA), Spoornet (the railways), Portnet (harbours), Petronet (pipelines), PX (container distribution) and Autonet. Its assets are R39,2-billion. The 1995 financial year marked a significant milestone for Transnet when it reported its first profit (R118-million) in four years. Of this, Spoornet contributed R734-million (R576- million in 1994), Portnet R1,1-billion (R766- million), SAA R217-million (-R23-million), Petronet R144-million (R149-million), Autonet R20-million (R17-million) and PX a R297- million loss (-R344-million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without its almost R1,8-billion pension contribution, the group would thus have made R1,9-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BusinessMap reports that Transnet is doubling its capital investments from R1,2-billion in 1994/95 (of which R750-million was for expansion) to R2,5-billion this year (R1,5- billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eskom has seen its net income rise 20% over 1995 to R2,7-billion and operating income rise 6,5% to R5,8-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Total revenue is up 11% to R17,1-billion and the debt/equity ratio dropped to 1,45 (1,73 at the end of 1994). Its assets are R41-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arms manufacturer Denel (formerly Armscor) began trading as a private company in 1992. Its assets are worth R4,1-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its two-pronged strategy of exporting and diversifying have seen military exports double from R480-million in 1992 to R996-million in 1995 and commercial exports grow from R31- million to R186-million over this period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Total income is up from R2,8-billion in 1992 to R3,2-billion in 1995 and net income before tax is up from R290-million to R325-million in 1994. Denel paid a R70-million dividend to government last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says BusinessMap: &quot;The reports are so glowing that it might well be asked why government thinks it's necessary to have a national strategy of restructuring its enterprises -- rather than simply addressing a few problematic ones and leaving the ownership of the rest intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;However, all that glitters is not gold. Profitability is improving, but it can be argued that with restructuring, government could get more from its enterprises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The public enterprises form an integral component in shaping and supporting the economic infrastructure behind government's reconstruction and development programme (RDP). Because of their strategic products and size -- -- the Financial Mail ranks Eskom and Transnet as South Africa's 10th and 11th largest businesses respectively in terms of assets -- they are in a position to play a dramatic supportive role in South Africa's socio-economic transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their products, particularly electricity and rail, ship and air transport, are the engine room for the economy's development and well- being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, what to do with these state assets has immense consequences politically, socially and economically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister Stella Sigcau has overseen the shift in policy from being broadly neutral -- neither privatise nor nationalise, but commercialise -- to one of accepting their &quot;restructuring&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Telkom, not under Sigcau's authority, is likely to be the first state enterprise to test government's new restructuring policy when it obtains a strategic equity partner, possibly this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The rand's slide shows no sign of abating and sentiment is still heavily weighted against a turnaround. At the time of going to press, the dollar rate was heading for R4, while sterling had already broken through the R6 barrier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Intervention by the Reserve Bank has been sporadic and light, underlining the government's reluctance to fight the markets. And comments made earlier in the week by governor Dr Chris Stals and finance minister Chris Liebenberg did little to calm the jitters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many economists believe the correction was justified and anticipated -- only the extent and timing of the slump came as a surprise. But credibility among foreign investors, in particular, has been badly dented. Between now and the budget, the markets are going to want some clear signs of action on exchange controls if the rand is to recover some lost ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Peter Hilsenrath, chief economist at Syfrets: &quot;The rand's slide has created a window of opportunity for the government to relax exchange controls. With high real interest rates and a very weak currency, there is less chance of hefty capital outflows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keith Lockwood, South Africa Chamber of Business economist, agreed: &quot;The authorities should push ahead with easing exchange restrictions to demonstrate their faith in the economy and their policies. Foreign investors need a concrete sign that the government is committed to freeing up the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against a basket of currencies, however, the rand's depreciation is less severe, providing some consolation on the inflation front. Indeed, most economists had factored a depreciation into their inflation calculations, so 6% still looks a reasonable bet for this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An early cut in interest rates is now ruled out, however; Stals will need all the help he can get to prevent a further free-fall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa this week patched up its friendship with Algeria after an earlier meeting between President Nelson Mandela and Algerian exile leader Anouar Haddam sent tempers soaring in Algiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela received Haddam, the United States- based leader of a faction of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), at his Cape Town residence last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algerian President Liamine Zeroual's government accused Mandela of fraternising with a &quot;terrorist&quot; and threatened to recall its Pretoria ambassador, Said Kitouni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa moved fast to patch up the relationship. On Tuesday night Mandela phoned Zeroual, and Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo met ambassadors from 12 Islamic countries, including Algeria, on Wednesday.  Foreign Affairs defended the Haddam meeting, saying it had been &quot;in the context&quot; of South Africa's stance on democracy and human rights, but blamed Haddam for &quot;misrepresenting&quot; the nature of the contact. It announced Nzo's deputy, Aziz Pahad, would visit Algeria at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That seemed to mollify Algiers, but it is unclear why Zeroual was so offended by the Mandela-Haddam meeting; after all, there have been moves towards dialogue between the Algerian government and the FIS, which is potentially more conciliatory than the extremist Armed Islamic Group. One explanation is the Algerian government is scared it will lose control of the process. Pat Chacker, of the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: &quot;They (the Algiers government) signal that they want to talk, but it's that they want to talk on their own terms.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) February 23, 1996 by David Beresford</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Outside Malawi's administrative capital of Lilongwe, above the gate at the entrance to a country estate, a life-size lion stands on its hind legs leaning languidly on a spear. At the end of the 2km driveway is New State House, the nine-bedroom palace with bowling-green lawns tended by 190 gardeners which was the home of Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The self-styled &quot;Lion of Malawi&quot; only spent one night in his new residence before being turfed out of power in the 1994 multiparty elections.  His successor, Bakili Muluzi, has scorned the pretensions of his predecessor, refusing to take occupation. So it stands as a bizarre memorial to one of the more eccentric dictators thrown up by a continent of despots.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Eccentric&quot; is perhaps too affectionate a term to describe the 30 years of Banda's rule. There was the delightfully dotty side to him, the Mr Chips who found himself president -- giving expression to a passion for Plato by creating a society of serfs, guardians and would-be philosopher kings. But when one considers the basket-case status to which he reduced a potentially vibrant nation the charge must be of a more criminal nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country's cabinet ministers no longer need fear having their heads stoved in with tent- peg hammers. The Tontons-Macoutes-like &quot;Young Pioneers&quot; no longer haunt the bars and other public gathering places in hopes of over- hearing chance remarks which could be crafted into leg irons, or worse. But the ravages of Banda's rule are still overwhelming in their legacy for this country of some 11,5-million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His concern solely for the interests of a small elite translates into contemporary statistics, Malawi being not only the ninth- poorest nation in the world, but ranking only after Brazil for the highest level of income inequality between the haves and have-nots. Nearly one in four children cannot be expected to live beyond the age of five. Every other child displays signs of stunted growth. Girls can expect to have nearly seven children in their life-time -- contributing to a population explosion running at 3,2% per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the last count, 80% of the people were living on $55 (about R220), or less a year. Only 45% of the population is literate in vernacular languages (30% in English) thanks to Banda's contempt for the educational requirements of the masses which matched that of Hendrik Verwoerd. The country has no television station, one radio station, no cinemas and a grand total of seven traffic lights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It all amounts to the most basic of base lines from which the nation can hardly fail to progress. And progress is at least there, in such gestures as President Muluzi's edict that primary school education is free (if not yet compulsory) and the withdrawal of state funding for Banda College, President Chips' notorious Eton-in-the-bush where expatriate teachers force-fed the children of the political elite a diet of such as Cicero and Caesar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most striking manifestation of multiparty democracy is a familiar one -- the flowering of the newspaper industry. There are about 20 extant titles struggling to find a corner in a tiny market. They tend to be party-aligned. But they show a fine disregard for the sensitivities of the political elite, glorying in the exposure of such ministerial pecaddillos as failure to declare to airport customs first-world goodies culled on overseas trips and berating the polygamous Mr Muluzi for such breaches of constitutional niceties as politicking on the presidential budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That blight of African politics, corruption, does rear it head from time to time: one minister piously justifying the award of a state haulage contract to his own transport company on the grounds that it is the best in the country; another inexplicably accepting a UK tender three times as expensive as a South African bid. But an anti-corruption commission was voted into existence during the last session of parliament and the principle of clean government is at least established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democratic rule looks safe, at least in the interim. The coalition government seems shaky on occasion; recently the junior partner, the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), threatened to pull out in protest against regional favouritism -- charging that 50 of the government's 57 &quot;principal secretaries&quot; were from Muluzi's stronghold in the south (the term &quot;permanent secretary&quot; was banned by Banda with the reported remark that &quot;I am the only permanent thing around here&quot;). But for the time being, at least, the Congress Party, still under the leadership of the now senile Dr Banda, is offering no coherent challenge for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Real power anyway belongs to the international community in Malawi at the moment, thanks to the country's overwhelming dependence on foreign aid.  The focus of that power is on a grandiose building in Lilongwe, the design of which local guide books liken to a grain basket -- symbolic of the wealth of the country. Mathews Chikaonda, the governor of the Reserve Bank which the building houses, likens it to an upturned saucepan, the symbolism of which is indicated by the snort of laughter which accompanies the sally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Chikaonda (41) was persuaded to give up a professorship at Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland in August 1994 to join Malawi's Reserve Bank. As governor he plays a role in Malawi today that can be likened to a receiver put in to oversee the affairs of a bankrupt business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In November 1994, the Malawian government, under heavy pressure from international donors to take radical measures to halt the nation's runaway economy, agreed to introduce a cash budgeting system. Aimed at forcing the politicians to cut their proverbial suits according to the cloth available, it tied government departments to a monthly budget based on the previous month's revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To police the new regime the Reserve Bank turned to the private sector, transferring ministerial accounts to the country's commercial banks to take advantage of their stringent supervision of overdraft facilities -- which were simply refused to government departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the first month under the cash budgeting system 47 departmental cheques were bounced. At Chikaonda's urging the cabinet passed a regulation by which officials responsible for presenting dishonoured cheques were given a warning on the first occasion, demoted with a cut in salary on the second and fired for a third infraction. In Malawi, government cheques no longer bounce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The system is a crude, if effective means of financial administration, bringing pressure for cut-backs in a parasitical civil service -- accounting for over 20% of formal employment in the country. A survey uncovered a body of some 30 000 workers hired on short- term contacts under the Banda regime who had mysteriously become permanent employees. A schools census magically cut the teachers' salary bill by some 15%, having apparently flushed out a legion of &quot;ghost-workers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, for all its effectiveness the system makes for harsh administration. This month the country's teachers and doctors were threatening a strike in protest against non- payment of last month's salaries. At Blantyre's Queen Elizabeth Hospital -- Malawi's biggest -- the operating theatres came to a standstill last month when they ran out of surgical gloves. This month they have run out of Paracetemol. Locals call the hospital &quot;the departure lounge&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Life is thin on the edge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - With both Western Cape MEC for Local Government Peter Marais and the African National Congress threatening court action, the elections scheduled for May 29 in the Western Cape are in jeopardy again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is disputing a model proposed by Marais for rural local government which it says disenfranchises farmworkers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marais counters that the model was proclaimed last December, and that the ANC's protests have come too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's objection is that if the model is implemented, it is likely to remain in force until the next local government elections, after 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC says Marais's proposal -- that transitional rural councils have 60% of their councillors nominated on the basis of half the positions going to farmer organisations and half to farmworker organisations -- gives unfair representation to farmers .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also objects to the definition of a farmworker, which excludes any person working on a farm for less than six months of the year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The &quot;fruit route&quot; which wanders through the Boland town of Grabouw is not as well known as the Cape's wine route, but the panorama it offers is easily on a par. Apple trees weighted down with starkings and golden delicious apples send a sweet perfume wafting through the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hidden behind the valleys and dales studded with trees are huge packing sheds, where conveyer belts send thousands of apples hurtling towards hundreds of women who grade and select the best for packaging and export around the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's apple season in the Cape and the harvest needs the labour of thousands of people to pick and pack the fruit. Seasonal workers are roped in for a three-month period until the end of the harvest in May. Most live in the area, raise their children and spend their income there, but will be precluded by Western Cape Local Government MEC Peter Marais from participating in the rural councils on May 29 if they work for less than six months a year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The majority of the seasonal workers at Mizpah Farm in Grabouw are women, colourfully decked out in green scarves and overalls and white boots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maria Windvogel has lived in Grabouw for 13 years. Every season she waits anxiously for the farm manager at Mizpah to let her know whether there is work for her at the packing shed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My mother, my sister and I only have fixed employment for three months every year. At the end of the season we have to ask for other work, and most of the time it's work outside in the orchards,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't really like working the orchards because it's so tiring. When the trees are pruned they expect the women to carry the heavy ladders all over the orchard all day. We're doing the work men used to do before because women work so much harder but they get paid less than men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But when the farmers give full-time work, the men get those jobs. A single mother like me can't find work and farm housing, but a young man without a family will find it easier to get a house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Windvogel would like to vote on May 29 as there are many issues she would like addressed by a rural council -- like housing and improved conditions at the farm school her children attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I voted in 1994, but didn't enjoy it at all. The farmer where I was working loaded all the workers on to his truck on the afternoon of the last day of voting and said we must all go and vote for the National Party. I did what he said and only found out afterwards that I could have voted for anyone I chose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This time round, I know who I want to vote for. I want to vote for the people who are going to make life better for the seasonal workers. If the union puts people up to stand in the elections, they will get my vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1991 Agricultural Survey, conducted by the Western Cape government, showed there were 79 281 seasonal workers employed in the region. The lowest income, in the Little Karoo, was R515 a year and the highest, in the Cape metropolitan area, was R1 010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to researchers Andrienetta Kritzinger and Jan Vorster, whose report was finalised in November last year, up to 72% of all seasonal workers are women. &quot;The use of female workers has increased on nearly half the farms over the past five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They added that the extension of the Wage Act to the agricultural sector could result in farmers decreasing their permanent workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But workers like Windvogel have seen an increase in their earnings in the past two years, largely because of the efforts of the South African Agricultural and Plantation and Allied Workers Union (Sapaawu).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joanie Fredericks, the gender co-ordinator of Sapaawu, works full-time at Mizpah and is the only female forklift driver in region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fredericks says if the union nominates her as a councillor, she will probably be prepared to stand, as the position offers a greater chance to improve the lot of seasonal workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Marais has made sure seasonal workers can't speak for themselves. But he's in for a big surprise if I get on to the council,&quot; she says with a cheeky grin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The next &quot;third force&quot; trial in the Pretoria Supreme Court will implicate senior members of the Inkatha Freedom Party in a massive gun- running operation that may have fuelled the high levels of violence in KwaZulu-Natal and the Reef at the time of the 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the marathon Eugene de Kock trial nears an end, officials in the office of Transvaal Attorney General Jan D'Oliveira have been collecting evidence that is likely to implicate KwaZulu-Natal's former safety and security minister, Celani Mtethwa, IFP senator Phillip Powell, then-Transvaal party heavyweights Themba Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu, plus other officials, in fomenting political violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Kock has also indicated he is planning to make a submission to the truth commission (probably in the hope of obtaining a presidential pardon or mitigation of the sentence expected in his current trial) that will provide extensive details about a massive gun-running and paramilitary training operation he helped run for Inkatha in 1992 and 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both hearings will come after the Magnus Malan murder trial, which begins in Durban on April 4 and will focus on the 1980s training of Inkatha hit squads by members of military intelligence and their involvement in the 1987 KwaMakutha massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Vlakplaas supply of weapons and training to Inkatha will probably emerge as a sequel to this earlier bout of the security forces' backing for Inkatha -- and De Kock has told reporters his evidence to the truth commission will implicate at least a dozen police and army generals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some evidence about the 1990s paramilitary operation has already emerged in the current De Kock case. Documents shown only to Justice Willem van der Merwe during the trial indicate that Mthetwa and Khoza were registered Vlakplaas informers and were paid between R1 000 and R2 000 a month each from the police's secret fund from 1990 to 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Kock's senior counsel, Flip Hattingh, has also admitted that his client personally supplied six truckloads of arms, ammunition and explosives to IFP officials in Ulundi in October 1993, &quot;at the request of IFP senator Phillip Powell&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The materiel -- which included 700 anti-tank mines, 182 RPG7 rockets, 1000 hand grenades, 120 mortar bombs and some 30 000 rounds of 7.62 ammunition -- has never been recovered. The forthcoming trial will explore evidence that some of it was used in political murders that have become endemic in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Kock's admission corroborates evidence given to the Goldstone Commission by the colonel's former colleagues Brood van Heerden and Willie Nortje. They provided details about a flow of arms to Inkatha units on the Reef in 1992 and continued links between De Kock and senior party officials after Vlakplaas was disbanded in April 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nortje gave details about military training that had taken place at the Mlaba camp near the Umfolozi game reserve in northern KwaZulu- Natal. The training was run by Powell assisted by De Kok and two Vlakplaas colleagues, &quot;Snor&quot; Vermeulen and Simon Radebe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Radebe told me about 500 IFP recruits on a two-week course had been trained in the use of SADF-issue rifles, AK-47s, RPG7s, explosives and the planting of land mines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nortje's evidence to Goldstone states that Humphrey Ndlovu, his brother Victor, and James Ndlovu were also on the police's secret payroll.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judge was appointed to head a one-man inquiry into Coetzee's allegations that death squads were operating in the police force in January 1990 by then-president FW de Klerk in the wake of sensational death squad revelations by Coetzee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harms was dubbed the &quot;Prince of Probes&quot; at the time and the president promised that the enquiry would &quot;cut to the bone&quot; allegations about politically sanctioned murder. In the end, the inquiry reported that it had failed to come up with evidence to back Coetzee's revelations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The (security police) &quot;mafia&quot; influenced Judge Harms to such an extent that he said to me: 'How must I believe this crap you're talking?' and in the end I was dismissed as mad,&quot; Coetzee told the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Judge Harms absolutely did not believe me. The things I said there, that the police denied under oath at a high level, have since proved to be the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evidence in the case also suggests that McNally, the KwaZulu-Natal attorney general who recently faced questions by a parliamentary committee about his alleged reluctance to prosecute Inkatha members for involvement in murder, was duped by failing to uncover evidence that the police's Vlakplaas unit took part in political killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McNally, then Free State AG, had been appointed along with CID chief General Alwyn Conradie in 1989 to investigate early claims by former Vlakplaas member Almond Nofomela that the police unit had murdered human rights activist Griffiths Mxenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The McNally report presented to the National Party government in November 1989 says: &quot;Nofomela's allegations in his statement do not correspond with the facts made available to the Committee&quot; and &quot;the Committee finds it difficult to attach any value to Coetzee's allegations and declarations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With respect, I think the two presiding officers (McNally and Conradie) have had to swallow their words, because it has since, I think, more than once, been shown that the bunch of lies and blind accusations against high-up people I have been accused of making left and right are true,&quot; Coetzee told the De Kock trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coetzee claimed the commission had made a fundamental mistake by accepting falsified police evidence that Joe Mamasela, one of the Vlakplaas operatives who participated in the Mxenge murder, had only been employed by the police unit in February 1982, some eight months after the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said of the McNally findings: &quot;Well, this was typical security police procedure in my time: smear, cover up and make out as a renegade the person that stands up, dares stand up, against the hierarchy ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier in the De Kock trial, Mamasela said in evidence that he has applied for indemnity with regard to his role in the Mxenge murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mamasela also described how he and other Vlakplaas officers had falsified records to show that he had only joined the police unit after the Mxenge murder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A line from one of Leonard Cohen's new, but still depressing, ballads sums up the message which has emanated remorselessly, almost every weekday for more than a year now, from Room DG3 in the Pretoria Supreme Court, where more than 80 witnesses have testified about the horrors committed by Colonel Eugene de Kock and members of his C10 police unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The song says there are killers in high places who still say their prayers at night and, unless we do something about this evil, it will envelop the cracks through which the light gets in. The problem is that, even with the truth commission and a revamped justice system in place, this is not going to be an easy task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The central theme of the De Kock trial, both in its content and the way it has been treated in the media, is that politically motivated murder had become so routine and so commonplace in the apartheid era that we have inherited a public realm filled with people who were directly or indirectly implicated in these acts -- and many of them already appear to have obtained an informal immunity from punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, paradoxically, the remorseless and repetitive accounts of outrageous acts that come out of the courtroom DG3 have, instead of outraging the public, created a kind of moral numbness -- as revealed in the following anecdote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Judge Richard Goldstone first received information about the activities of a host of senior security force members in early 1994 and then made his sensational allegations a month before the elections, it was decided between Nelson Mandela and then-president FW de Klerk that the country was too jittery for De Kock to be arrested then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The loyalty of the security forces, particularly the police, had not been secured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The investigators believed an enormous risk was taken in the delay. De Kock had sold his house, liquidated all his other assets, and his family had gone overseas. He was finally picked up two months after Goldstone said there was indeed a &quot;third force&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, as the year-old trial wraps up, most news media -- with the notable exception of the Sunday Times, Business Day, and to a lesser extent the Sowetan -- almost ignore it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a related theme which emerges from its proceedings. Former Askaris, Umkhonto we Sizwe guerillas who turned into brutal assassins for apartheid's police, spoke about the white officers who captured them and then &quot;forced&quot; them to murder. De Kock's old Vlakplaas buddies told the court about the extraordinary sway, sometimes through fear, but mostly because of the routine nature of their job, that their unit commander wielded over them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then, this week in court, De Kock's lawyers sent a strong signal that they will use details, ironically provided by witnesses for the state, to formulate two well-worn arguments when they try to mitigate the crimes their client committed. He acted on orders from above, some of them from men who still occupy high office. And, if De Kock is guilty, why should he be punished rather than the superiors and co-conspirators who still walk free?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next on the roll-call at the supreme court will be a massive case that hauls at least some of those generals implicated in the De Kock trial into the dock for their involvement in a massive gun-running operation to Inkatha paramilitaries based on the Reef and in KwaZulu-Natal -- an operation that fuelled the massive levels of violence there in the early 1990s (see story on facing page).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You can already see the words formulating on their lips as they glance upwards: &quot;We were just doing our jobs. It was the politicians and their policies who sanctioned what we did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk says he will appear at the truth commission. No doubt he will go armed with arguments about the &quot;political realities,&quot; the mindset, the milieu, the inheritances of the past ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This tendency by perpetrators to shift the blame for atrocities one level upwards and then to argue that their actions were part of their routine working environment endorsed by a superior order is reflected in testimony given by Sergeant Steve Bosch, the Vlakplaas technician who helped make the cassette bomb which blew apart the head of lawyer Bheki Mlangeni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sergeant told the court about a time when he was out driving with his commander. &quot;He (De Kock) turned to me and said he did not understand why he had to do all this dirty work ... It was difficult to refuse. If you didn't do it the following guy would do it. So the feeling was you must just do it and get it done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bosch's evidence suggests, to paraphrase Hannah Arendt's famous report on the Adolf Eichmann trial, that evil in the apartheid era was widespread not so much because its proponents were profoundly diabolical but because their work had become so routine, so banal, that they could do it without even thinking of its morality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The record of the trial is replete with similar examples. Vlakplaas operative Joe Mamasela participated either directly or indirectly in the murder of 53 people, including lawyer Griffiths Mxenge and Dr Fabian Ribeiro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Kock's lawyers read into the court record a description of Mamasela, made by Dirk Coetzee to the Harms Commission, which says: &quot;He is a killer. He had this so-called terrorist Vusi on his knees praying: 'Our Father who art in Heaven'. I don't know whether Joe knew that one (sic). And he kicked the poor guy to pieces. It was just blood running down in the heat of the sun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court record shows that Mamasela kept notes in a secret book about killings carried out by the Vlakplaas unit. Asked why he was selective in recording the names of people killed, Mamasela said: &quot;If I had to write all the names of the victims, I would be having a Bible ... I cannot be writing all the deaths. I mean, I will be a mortuary chap or what? I could not do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mamasela refused to incriminate himself during the trial but was prepared to make this point: &quot;Myself, I am a victim. I was acting against my own will and made a killer machinery against my own people. I was captured by the police. I was assaulted severely. I was brutalised. I am telling you. And then the police used me against my own people ... I did not commit one of them I will have been dead, I will have been Brian Ngqulunga today. If I did not become productive by killing these people, I will have been killed. I have no doubt in my mind about that.&quot; (The court was told Brian Ngqulunga, an Askari, was killed, as he was about to tell the truth to the Harms Commission.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What to do about the banality of all this murdering, and the determination of its proponents to throw up their hands and say they were acting on superior orders -- this is the great moral issue which will confront members of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee's amnesty committee, as well as the judges who will preside over the &quot;third force&quot; trials which will follow the one now wrapping up in Room GD3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prosecutors seem confident there is little doubt that De Kock should, and will, get a long prison sentence. But initial indications are that many of apartheid's other killers could slip through the net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of the Vlakplaas operatives who gave evidence against &quot;Prime Evil&quot;, as De Kock has been dubbed, have been told they will be indemnified from prosecution in connection with the 120-odd charges, including eight of murder, laid against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are reliable reports that Mamasela is working, at least informally, with one of the country's existing intelligence agencies and has also had a recent meeting with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. He earned some R400 000 in severance money from Vlakplaas, paid mainly to keep him quiet, and used it to start a business that still thrives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The truth commission legislation stipulates that people who committed crimes of a &quot;heinous&quot; nature will not be granted indemnity. Some of them appear to have it already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another potential problem is that the truth commission law promises that all revelations and confessions made in applications to the amnesty committee cannot, unlike evidence in a court of law, be used against a culprit -- even if the application is turned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some lawyers say this could make it very difficult, if not near impossible, to prosecute perpetrators of gross human rights crimes who talk to the amnesty committee before they have been independently investigated by any of the country's attorneys general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are also serious doubts about the capacity of the criminal justice system to prosecute all the crimes that emerge during forthcoming trials and truth commission hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there is Mandela's constitutional right to pardon anyone responsible for human rights abuses. So far, he has not exercised this enormously sensitive power. But at least one human rights lawyer says he is working with amnesty applicants from Umkhonto we Sizwe who are adamant that some political leaders are beginning to broker deals which promise this kind of pardon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the single most important lesson of the De Kock trial and the proceedings that will follow it: precisely because atrocious acts became so routine during our recent past, the granting of informal and formal amnesties could become just as commonplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If that happens, if those guilty of gross crimes against humanity are allowed to go free simply because they were &quot;given orders&quot; , then it will not be long before those in the public realm accustomed to killing will use the same argument to justify new crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leonard Cohen's song says the time has come to ring the bells that still will ring. To do that, and to prevent the evil of the perpetrators from contaminating the morals of the political system that replaced them -- that is the greatest challenge that faces this country's justice system and its new truth commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Just recovering from allegations that it had bugged some of the country's most senior policemen, South Africa's intelligence community is reeling under new charges that it is spying beyond the bounds of the law.  Now strong counter-claims suggest there is an &quot;agenda&quot; to discredit the spies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Minister Dullah Omar and Deputy Intelligence Minister Joe Nhlanhla joined forces at a press conference on Thursday to claim the anti-spy reporting was not incidental. Said Omar: &quot;The leaking of information was a deliberate attempt to destroy the intelligence capacity of our new democratic society.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omar's stance appears to be backed by a still- secret report of the National Intelligence Co- ordinating Committee (Nicoc), which brings together the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), the external South African Secret Service, Military Intelligence and the intelligence arm of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report details the findings of its investigation into claims that top police officers had been bugged, and that the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) had tasked former police hit-man Dirk Coetzee to spy on national police Commissioner George Fivaz and other senior officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The claims, which first surfaced early last month in reports by the Spectrum investigative unit of the Independent newspaper group, appeared at the time to be confirmed by Fivaz. Next week, Fivaz has to appear before Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence to give his version of the story. Just like the Independent titles that carried the story, Fivaz may have to wipe egg off his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hearing to be held by the parliamentary committee is one of three initiatives announced last month to get at the truth. Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said there would be a judicial inquiry, while Nicoc started its own investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judicial commission has not yet been appointed -- presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said this week an announcement can be expected soon -- and the parliamentary committee is only just starting its process.  But the Nicoc report is understood to be so firm in its exoneration of the NIA that the judicial inquiry may be redundant, save to help restore confidence in the country's spies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fivaz's liaison officer Sally de Beer this week declined to comment on the commissioner's apparent embarrassment in the face of the Nicoc findings, saying the separate inquiries first had to run their course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a source close to Fivaz pointed out that the commissioner had never directly blamed the NIA when he responded to questions: &quot;All he did was confirm certain information as had been reported to him at that time, and he did not blame anyone; in fact, he tried to exonerate the NIA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The source pointed out that Fivaz -- though he had repeated allegations that the NIA had told Coetzee to spy on him -- had told Spectrum he doubted the NIA was behind the &quot;bugging&quot; and that it could as well have been done by &quot;old guard&quot; police, by organised crime or by foreign agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood the report does not only exonerate the NIA as &quot;spotless&quot;, but finds that the reported incidents were without substance altogether. The &quot;bug&quot; found on police management forum chair Superintendent Gideon Oosthuizen's home phone, for example, was a misinterpretation by Telkom of a service interruption, while the wires in the office of Gauteng Commissioner Sharma Maharaj were from a previous &quot;in-house&quot; recording device not in use anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report also found in favour of Coetzee, apparently choosing his version above that of police Inspector HT Moodley, who told Fivaz that Coetzee had told him he was under orders to spy on the police top structure.  Omar said the report was also being handed to the parliamentary committee, and that he would ask for it to be released publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should the report -- which was unanimously drafted by all four agencies represented on Nicoc, including the police -- prove to be the final word, Fivaz may look silly, but no one has accused him of authoring the spate of spy-critical reporting that ensued. Instead, the report points a cautious finger in the direction of the source of the original leak of information to Spectrum; information which the Nicoc report holds to be misrepresentative of the true facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One among six terms of reference of the Nicoc investigation was to consider the source of the leak. The report points in the direction of an unnamed member of Fivaz's staff. The role of that person is understood to have been discussed with the Ministry of Safety and Security.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa's conservation organisations have split down the middle over a controversial offer by two international animal rights groups to give the National Parks Board (NPB) some R20-million in an effort to stave off this country's elephant culling programme and its traditional support for the international ivory trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Barritt, representative of the United States-based International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw), told the Mail &amp; Guardian his organisation had been holding sensitive negotiations with the parks board for more than a year about using the R20-million to purchase land for expanded elephant wildlife habitat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ifaw and the Humane Society of the United States are each offering US$2,5-million for the expansion of elephant reserves in an effort to deal with arguments from the parks board that the annual cull of Kruger's elephant population is neccessary because the country's existing protected area estate is not big enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A coalition of local wildlife NGOs -- including the Endangered Wildlife Trust, the Africa Resources Trust (ART) and the local branch of the World Wildlife Fund -- are vociferously opposed to this because they believe that the survival of conservation areas in Africa depends on the right to hunt animals and sell their products on local and international markets. They say this will allow parks to receive a financial return.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ART representative Victoria Hylton told the M&amp;G that the American groups are imposing an external agenda on African issues: &quot;A draft of the contract being negotiated stipulates that South Africa will not cull elephants for the next five years on land bought by this funding and that it will submit no elephant (trading) proposals to Cites (the Conference on International Trade in Endangered Species) in the next five years.We believe this is in an infringement of South Africa's sovereign rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hylton added that the Humane Society has stipulated its share of the proposed grant be used for research into elephant contraception, mainly the development of a pachyderm &quot;pill&quot;, that can be used as an alternative to culling the animals in wildlife reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said Art's information is that conservation agencies will not be able to manage elephant populations on land purchased with the two groups' funds unless they retain the right to control herd sizes through culling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;South Africa already has a policy on elephant management (that includes culling), which the parks board has placed under review. If these contracts are signed now, they will preclude a full review process from taking place.  All policy in South Africa has been opened to full public scrutiny -- why has the parks directorate done the same?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barritt said recent research had indicated that very little money from the &quot;consumptive utilisation&quot; of animals found its way to rural communities, as is often claimed by the proponents of culling and trophy hunting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said most of the revenues were appropriated by hunt organisers and conservation agencies -- and that South Africans stood to gain more from the expansion of widlife areas that can cater for the current tourism boom than from culling and hunting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a fight for the soul of conservation in South Africa. It is between those who want to preserve animals and those who want them as utility animals that can be killed and their parts sold&quot; he said. &quot;It will have repercussions for years to come. Our organisations are willing to put hard cash on the table and have a vision for a huge increase in wildlife areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Representatives of the NPB were not available for comment at the time of going to press. But it is believed that the organisation is caught in the crossfire between the lobby that wants game reserves to protect animals from all forms of hunting and the NGOs that insist African countries must have the right to trade in animal products if conservation is to survive on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parks board has recently adopted a flexible position on the debate and appears to have suspended its culling programme in Kruger, as well as its previous support for other Southern African countries that are lobbying Cites to relax its international ban on trade in ivory and other elephant products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is believed that the debate will be dealt with at an NPB board meeting at the end of March.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Potgietersrus gets up early. By 7am on Wednesday -- the last day of racial exclusivity for Potgietersrus Primary School -- four little girls were already on duty in their fluorescent orange vests. At the blast of the whistle they would raise their stop- signs to enable another barefoot blond child to trot across the road, their routine unshakeable despite the near-total absence of cars on the tree-lined street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Round the corner, a group of parents were conducting a different kind of vigil. The men in khaki shirts and boxer shorts, the women in dorp uniform, crimpolene and perms, had set up a mini-laager of plastic patio chairs inside the boundary fence and were drinking coffee. They would not say why they were there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was left to one of the patrol girls to explain the politics of the situation. &quot;It's fine for blacks to come to our school,&quot; she said. &quot;They just mustn't sit next to me.&quot; But little did this girl know that a few hours later parents of several black children would be registering their offspring at the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the Transvaal Supreme Court refused the school leave to appeal against a court order that the pupils be admitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of this, and local and international headlines, have gained the sweltering little Northern Province town a reputation as the new Ventersdorp.  Or, as the town council executive committee chair Doctor Ramaru puts it, &quot;a skunk among towns&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mayor Boysea Thole is worried investors will be turned away from the town by the strident noise of bigotry from the town's white community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the good burghers of Potgietersrus express almost as much confusion as the patrol girl's self-contradictory assessment of the situation -- -a babble of conflicting voices in a town which has yet to learn how to deal with conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the parents at the school, and white citizens of Potgietersrus in general, react with a defensive &quot;no comment&quot; when asked about the school.  Others shelter behind the need to preserve &quot;Afrikaner culture&quot;, an argument which has found no favour with the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's not about excluding black children,&quot; insists a Ray-banned, walrus-mustached man dropping his children at school. &quot;The media has misrepresented it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The black children can't speak Afrikaans or English,&quot; says Nola Venter who works in a hardware store, oblivious to the fact that parents such as Alson Matukane have sought to enroll their children at a school which offers English since they cannot write their mother tongue, Pedi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I know they are Christians, but their way of practising religion is different from ours. Look how they bury their dead. It's completely different from how we bury our dead,&quot; Venter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christians excluded from a Christian school, the Matakane children had an unexpected holiday on Wednesday. The Indian school they attended until this week, was closed for Eid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some white citizens are more forthright in their racism. &quot;Why don't they stay at their own school?&quot; asked an elderly woman who would not give her name, but who works in Potties Blanket Centre -- a shop whose clientele appeared to be entirely black. &quot;At their school an E is a high grade -- our children must get A grades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet many whites have come to accept the inevitable. &quot;They are mad!&quot; says florist Wendy Marshall of the school authorities. &quot;It was going to happen some or other time. They must accept it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while many white residents share the view that the end of segregation was the inevitability rather than a moral imperative, the parents encamped at the school have long since lost the support of apartheid's one-time moral apologist, the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk just across town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I respect other people's values and they don't threaten me,&quot; says Dominee Bernant Rademeyer. &quot;There is no need for fear. Besides,&quot; he adds, &quot;2,3% of the population in this province are white. They won't change anything with the protest action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The black parents whose children have been kept out of the school for more than a month agree that history is on their side. Yet caution persists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matukane, provincial director of water affairs, spent most of this week battling against floods, and looks weary as he tells of his protracted effort to enroll his children at Potgietersrus Primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matukane spent from 1992 to 1994 doing a master's degree in the United States and returned after the elections to find a much happier South Africa than the one he had left. Only having moved to Potgietersrus this year, he says, &quot;I didn't know my children would be the first black children at the school. So I was surprised to meet the forces at the gate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes most white parents are on his side, but won't speak out: &quot;There is a general fear of expressing oneself among the white community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leslie Phatudi, who also wants to register his daughter at the school, says he has encountered no racism while living in white Potgieterus, other than from the hostile school parents. But he distrusts the ability of the present school authorities to implement the court order which demands admission and fair treatment for the pupils, and hopes the provincial government will exercise its powers to appoint a new management committee and principal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matukane, who seems to be motivated equally by crusading zeal and the simple need to get his children into the nearest neighbourhood school, is ambivalent about whether he still wants his children to be educated by the people who tried to drive them away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over in Mahwelereng the number of parents who are considering the newly-open Potgietersrus Primary as a future option for their children is enough to cause sleepless nights in the laager. Yet local schoolteacher Rose Manyatela has no illusions. &quot;I wouldn't send my children there. They'd still oppress them,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parents on their plastic chairs, who'd held out against the government, the courts, and according to the NGK, God, realised the end was in sight on Wednesday when the court refused them leave to appeal. But they went down fighting, some talking of petitioning the Constitutional Court, some of using &quot;whatever means necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Returning from registering his children at the school, Matukane said: &quot;The battle is only beginning.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - If the old guard in the former South African Defence Force had had its way, the documents revealed on these pages would have stayed locked up in a supreme court vault. When Commandant Jan Anton Nieuwoudt sued the SADF for a payout on the eve of the elections in 1994, both sides called for the matter to be heard in camera as Nieuwoudt's job had included the recruitment of sources, the interrogation of hundreds of guerillas, and the identification of targets for overt and covert operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lawyers involved stated that the matter needed to be in camera to prevent exposure of current covert military operations, meaning clandestine operations under way the month the elections were being held.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case was initially held in camera, but after two days' evidence the judge replaced this ruling and opened the court. The proceedings halted the same day and an out-of- court settlement was reached in a hurry, apparently to stop any further exposures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The matter was considered so sensitive that the then SADF chief General Kat Liebenberg asked the minister of defence for authorisation to pay out Nieuwoudt more than the court awarded him, apparently in order to keep the details of the clandestine operations quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until this week it was believed that the matter had always been closed to the public. Then the records were discovered by Colonel Gerrie Hugo, who was looking for evidence about the clandestine unit Nieuwoudt ran in Ciskei to use in his own civil claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nieuwoudt documents essentially back up everything that Hugo previously accused the International Researchers-Ciskei Intelligence Services unit of doing, and show that the SADF still regarded the ANC and PAC as military enemies after 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an attempt to silence Nieuwoudt and prevent public access to these documents, the then SADF chief General Kat Liebenberg wrote to the minister of defence in March and again in April 1993, asking for authority to pay out Nieuwoudt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liebenberg suggested paying out Nieuwoudt the difference between what the supreme court ruled the military should pay him, and Nieuwoudt's own minimum demand, which amounted to R400 000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - After the military's discredited Civil Co- operation Bureau (CCB) was officially closed down in July 1990, many of its principal members and shadowy activities were taken over by a key Military Intelligence's (MI) front organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CCB was shut down after a year of scandals over its joint intelligence-gathering and operational activities, and allegations of its involvement in the assassination of prominent political activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But instead of shutting down completely, documents which emerged this week indicate the CCB's functions were taken over by the existing MI front, Pan Afrik Industrial Investment Consultants cc (PAIIC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PAIIC was based in MI's offices in Momentum Mews in Pretoria until those offices were raided by the Goldstone Commission in November 1992. It's existence was exposed in the Mail &amp; Guardian a year later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evidence from the civil case brought by former MI member Commandant Jan Anton Nieuwoudt against the military for a payout in early 1994, indicates that PAIIC was a crucial part of the military's plans for covert operations both locally and internationally in the run-up to the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nieuwoudt's evidence came to light this week. His case was initially heard in camera, but that ruling was quietly lifted, unknown to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nieuwoudt told the court that PAIIC emerged out of a more informal system called &quot;Hotpoint&quot;, which had been used previously to hide members' links to the South African Defence Force. He said the members of the PAIIC closed corporation included the SADF's chief of staff intelligence at the time, General Witkop Badenhorst, and the director of Covert Collection, Brigadier Tolletjie Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nieuwoudt said there were three types of people who worked under PAIIC.  These were Permanent Force members who needed good cover in order to operate internationally, members of the National Intelligence Service and members of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way PAICC was similar to the CCB -- it grouped together operatives from the key intelligence services and its members operated outside South Africa's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PAIIC members apparently continued to operate outside the country even after the ANC was unbanned, as Nieuwoudt referred to plans for using PAIIC for this himself after he had left Ciskei in late 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PAIIC appears to have been regarded as a crucial part of the military and was possibly expected to continue operating without official sanction even after the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nieuwoudt explained the organisation's importance to the court: &quot;I just want to say to you, you cannot close down PAIIC. PAIIC is the defence force.  The director of Covert Collection said that, because we said to him, brigadier, there are indications that people are working against us; then he said boys, the guys cannot close down the defence force, no matter who controls this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The defence force must always be there and that was the agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Military Intelligence (MI) tried to recruit present Minister of Defence Joe Modise nearly two years before the 1994 elections, relying on a belief that Modise was willing to smash the ANC-SACP alliance in order to secure his own position under a future government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plan is outlined in a top-secret memo, one of only four official copies, which was drafted in September 1992 and sent to the head of MI's Directorate of Covert Collection (DCC). There is no indication of what happened in the recruitment attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-page memo discusses the conflict within the African National Congress (ANC) between the militants, headed by Chris Hani, and the moderates, headed by Modise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The memo, which was drafted by senior DCC officer Commandant Anton Nieuwoudt, suggests strengthening the government of the day's position by discrediting South African Communist Party (SACP) and militant ANC members, by &quot;recruiting ANC agents of influence&quot;, and by &quot;exploiting the conflict within MK (Umkhonto weSizwe)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The memo then immediately goes on to discuss how &quot;Agent 241/222 is prepared to have a secret meeting with the defence force, along with: J Modise (MK commander), L Moloi (chief of operations, MK), MK Zakes (regional commander PWV), MK Maincheck (commander of MK outside South Africa) and J Mnisi (commander Pretoria)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere in the document, &quot;Agent 241/ 222&quot; is referred to as an MK regional commander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Modise this week denied that he had ever attended such a meeting, but declined to answer any furhter questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nieuwoudt notes that Modise and his four colleagues were targeted because they could be used against Hani. They were regarded as open to recruitment due to their own self-interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This discussion is also with people who want to promote their own agenda (assuring own positions), but who are also prepared to break the back of the ANC/SACP backbone,&quot; he states in the memo in his motivation for the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The memo notes that Modise had key support within MK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This meeting could be instrumental in beginning to neutralise the SACP/Hani/(Ronnie) Kasrils faction. It could also be used to win votes in an upcoming election if the SACP participants could be neutralised,&quot; says the memo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The MK (old trained leaders) with their decision-makers such as those named in paragraph 5 (Modise and company) do not wish to fight with the SADF.  Hani and his young militant guard want to fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The options which could come out of such a meeting are legion, for example, the incorporation of moderate MKs, the empowerment of compromised witnesses against the militants, the utilisation of own ANC members as instruments at street level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This meeting can take place completely anonymously, it is however our feeling that a powerful delegation has to talk to such members to ensure exploitation, shock action, mobility and good communication in the final phase of this objective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there is no indication whether any of the group aproached were indeed re-cruited, at least two now hold senior positions. Modise is the minister of defence and in June 1994 Lambert Moloi was promoted to major-general and made chief of the Service Brigade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The memo is from a bundle of military documents used in Nieuwoudt's civil claim against the South African Defence Force for a payout after he lost his job following the Goldstone raid on DCC offices in November 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The claim went to court in early April 1994 and was settled out of court just after the elections. The case was initially heard in camera, but it has now emerged that that ruling was lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time the memo was written, Nieuwoudt was MI's Staff Officer First Class, Internal Sub-Theatre Western Front. He wrote the memo under a colleague's name (for &quot;security reasons&quot;) and signed it with his pseudonym &quot;Fox&quot;, but gave his real position in MI. He sent the memo to his DCC boss, Colonel At Nel, and DCC director Brigadier Tolletjie Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All three officers were among those fired by then president FW de Klerk following the Goldstone raid just two months after the memo was drafted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In evidence during his civil case, Nieuwoudt stated that just before the Goldstone raid, the DCC was busy recruiting &quot;a very senior member of the intelligence service of the ANC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Referring back to the period just after the memo was written, he commented that MI already knew then which of their sources among the MK members would be appointed as generals, brigadiers and lieutenant-colonels in the new military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a second top-secret memo from September 1992, of which only one official copy existed, Nieuwoudt outlines to Nel plans to close down some sources and to go ahead with others. One of those sources, described as &quot;in place (ANC) and going ahead&quot;, was Agent 241/222.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other well-placed sources within the Pan Africanist Congress were also maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A third top-secret document, again the sole official copy in existence, was sent on December 9 1992. This document noted how &quot;Fox&quot; had &quot;efficiently executed his duty as a principal agent controlling eight handlers and their respective source networks in the Witwatersrand area&quot; and had produced 431 intelligence reports. The memo urged retaining &quot;Fox's&quot; services into 1993.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba has been given 18 hours to resolve the impasse between his government and the University of Zambia Students' Union (UNZASU) in a latest ultimatum issued by students after their meeting with him ended in a deadlock yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mood at the University of Zambia (UNZA) main campus was last night tense as students pondered their next move which UNZASU President Emmanuel Tembo says will be known from the events after midday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have given government up to 12:00 hours today to solve our problem.  If they fail to do that we are doing something but that will be seen after mid- day tomorrow&quot; Tembo said in an interview last night. He said students have so far exhausted all channels and were surprised about how lowly government thought of the university.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These people don't just care about this place,&quot; Tembo said. &quot;It is shocking that they not only know little about the university but they don't even see the need to maintain it.&quot; He disclosed that the meeting with President Chiluba, forced at the height of a student demonstration at State House yesterday, was a deadlock. &quot;The President was basically merely playing with words. He gave nothing concrete,&quot; Tembo said. &quot;He in fact claimed not to know anything about our plight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the President was not even sure the institution had opened.  President Chiluba told the students in the meeting, also attended by education minister Alfeyo Hambayi that he needed more time to consult with education officials before he could make a decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But his non committal position has angered students who feel he is indecisive. The students are demanding an increase in the meal allowances from K60,000 to K90,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The closed meeting held after President Chiluba failed to agree with the more than five hundred demonstrators over the matter. In his address, President Chiluba pleaded with the students who marched to State House demanding an explanation from him on the delay to increase their allowances to give him time. &quot;I am not here to hoodwink you but I will immediately get in touch with the Minister of Education so that the meal issue is quickly sorted out,&quot; the President assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But his appeal angered the students who wanted to know whether their demands would be met or not, forcing them to refuse to leave the State House grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier in the day University of Zambia students marched to the Ministry of Education headquarters to petition government over their plight. The demonstration, which comes a day after UNZASU and the Bursaries Committee reached a dead-lock on the students' demand, was led by UNZASU president Tembo. Students marched from the Great East Road campus yesterday morning to Ministry of Education headquarters where they brought operations to a standstill for about three hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Education permanent secretary, Kasanda Sichalwe, had a difficult time trying to reason with the students who poured tonnes of a motley assortment of insults on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Excuse me please,&quot; Kasanda said as the students shouted at him. He later tried another way asking: &quot;What is the problem?&quot; In reply, the students asked the permanent secretary to explain why they have not been paid their meal allowances, including an increment, two weeks after the academic calendar had commenced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The students demanded to be paid their allowances the same day (yesterday). Sichalwe tried to speak through interjections to respond to the question. &quot;I have got your message, but the issue cannot be resolved right now,&quot; Sichalwe pleaded. &quot;As for the allowances, we have compiled all the data and some of you, particularly first year students, will get your money tomorrow (today), but for returning students you have to wait probably until Friday or Monday. But be aware that we were working on old rates because we don't have money for the new rates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The students were not satisfied. They booed him and demanded to be addressed by his boss the education minister Alfeyo Hambayi. Hambayi fueled the mood when he told the students he had never heard of their problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have seen your placards. This issue is being raised for the first time and it cannot be resolved now,&quot; said Hambayi amidst missiles of insults which he could not withstand: &quot;We cannot continue because you don't want to give me a platform,&quot; he said as he walked away. Hambayi later met students leaders and offered to meet only 75 per cent of the demand but the students were not pleased with this either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Immediately they crossed over to the finance ministry for a showdown with finance minister Ronald Penza. However, neither the finance minister nor his permanent secretary were in office. And frustrated, some students started deflating tyres of all government motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was at this stage that the student leaders consulted each other over the demonstration, which was - serve for deflation of tyres and insults - peaceful and under the constant police vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNZASU president later announced the new direction-State House.  &quot;We will not give them chance this time over these allowances,&quot; UNZASU president Tembo said in an interview yesterday . &quot;We feel cheated.&quot; And from here the students headed for State House.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Speaker of the National Assembly, Robinson Nabulyato, ruled in parliament yesterday that any debate on the Israeli company, Nikuv, was subjud-ice. Nabulyato made this ruling when Solwezi National Party member of parliament, Humphrey Mulemba, asked Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda what the role of the company would be since he (Miyanda) had moved that the house adjourn sine die on Friday to enable members of parliament go to their constituencies and assist in the voter's registration exercise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the move was challenged by Kasanengwa UNIP member of parliament Professor Patrick Mvunga who argued that if debate on Nikuv was subjudice then government was not in order to tell members of parliament to go and assist in the voter's registration exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since the issue of Nikuv is subjudice, is the government in order to tell members of parliament to go and assist in a matter that is subjudice?&quot; Mvunga asked. He was supported by Mongu National Party member of parliament, Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika, who also questioned the government's wisdom in sending members of parliament to go and assist in the voter's registration exercise when most of the logistics and materials required for the exercise were not in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we are serious, all the films for the National Registration Cards, the papers, the workers and doors to the registration centres must be open and in place if the targeted figure is to be reached,&quot; Lewanika advised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his reply, Miyanda admitted that there were indeed logistical difficulties but implored the members of parliament to assist in the exercise as they were stake holders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - ONLY 1.6 people million have registered as voters through out the country as at February 9, Elections Office public liaison officer Joe Sikazwe disclosed at a press briefing in Lusaka yesterday. Sikazwe said these are the latest figures for the just ended extended registration period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The national total of registered voters collected to February 9 is 1,624,094 people,&quot; Sikazwe said, &quot; which is 37 per cent of the eligible voters.&quot; The figure has shocked the Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) leadership.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The 1.6 million is unbelievable, it is not encouraging at all,&quot; said FODEP secretary Bishop John Mambo in an interview yesterday. &quot;There is still a lot of work to do and I hope we will utilise the remaining time to register at least 3 million people.&quot; Mambo attributed the apathy to the organisation and coordination of the registration exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We do not understand why the Elections Office has to work in isolation when NGOs who are monitoring elections are left out in such important programmes,&quot; Mambo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mambo also dismissed the call to postpone the elections to 1997. &quot;We just have to work hard and educate the people about voting, so that they can register, putting off the elections to next year will only complicate this democracy,&quot; Mambo advised. &quot;Neither can I welcome the idea of having the elections with the old register because we will be depriving a lot of people of their basic right to vote. I can only welcome the continous registration exercise till the voting day as all other NGOs are suggesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) has maintained its position on continous registration of voters and supported the idea of putting off the elections to next year if a democratic government is to be elected by the majority vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIMT president Alfred Zulu said in an interview yesterday that the current exercise has failed and wondered if the remaining 9 days before the programme ends will register another 1.6 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For elections to take place, at least 3.6 million people should register and I wonder if in the remaining 9 days 2 million people will register,&quot; Zulu said. &quot;It will be better to put off the elections to next year so that we can register as many people as possible.&quot; And opposition UNIP vice-secretary for information and publicity, Pickson Chitambala, called for an immediate stop of the exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We called for the renewal of the voters register but we did not know that it will lead us to this mess of Nikuv and such apathy from the people,&quot; Chitambala carped in an interview yesterday. &quot;Why did they bring in Nikuv to rig the elections for MMD? That is why we should have the elections this year using the old register.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Sacked Times of Zambia editor, Arthur Simuchoba yesterday claimed he was a victim of State House manoeuvres. Simuchoba believes his dismissal cannot be divorced from the manoeuvres of State House and press aide Richard Sakala has several times expressed governments open disgust for his 'negative' attitude towards the MMD government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And obviously Sakala was working on instructions,&quot; Simuchoba said in an interview yesterday. &quot;Not that I have anything personal against him. As far as I was concerned we were friends. But I understand. Work is work.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former Times editor said he was aware of severe relations between him and MMD members on the board over his journalistic stand. He claimed he has since being recalled not been invited to any board meeting at the Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; Even junior members received invitations not me. Everything happened behind my back at the Times,&quot; Simuchoba said. &quot;I was only doing my job but I believe I was misunderstood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Simuchoba maintained he had no regrets that he did not compromise on good press freedom values to appease partisan wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is an assault on press freedom, not me,&quot; Simuchoba said. &quot;To me it was something that I saw coming one day but I had a job to do and I wanted to do it well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But yesterday the Zambia Civic Education Association was busy mobilising a public protest re-scheduled to today, against Simuchoba's dismissal. By mid day large size posters had been flooded in several strategic points and several printed flyers had been produced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to organiser and ZCEA board member Chibembe Nyalugwe the demonstration will start from the assembly point in the main post office car park on Cairo road at 09:00 hours this morning. ZCEA has since been joined by the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT), Afronet and the Press Association of Zambia (PAZA) in condemning the Times move against Simuchoba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The man is a very competent journalist and he tried to run the Times competitively with the privately owned Post newspaper, he was critical and his editorials were professional,&quot; said ZIMT president Alfred Zulu, adding: &quot;His dismissal is nothing but political. They want to hijack the paper to use it as a campaign medium.&quot; Zulu joined the ZCEA in calling for the dissolution of the Times board. And Afronet executive director, Ngande Mwanajiti, in a statement released in Lusaka viewed the termination of Mr Arthur Simuchoba's contract &quot;as suspect and a gross human rights violation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PAZA, according to its president, Francis Kasoma, has taken up legal action against the Times Board over Simuchoba's dismissal .  &quot;Simuchoba's dismissal confirms PAZA's stand that government owned media can never be free,&quot; Kasoma told the press yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the Copperbelt the Zambia Union of Journalists resolved at the end of their meeting to hold back their action saying they would stand by PAZA's legal action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Finance minister, Ronald Penza, was yesterday taken to task by back benchers over the Customs and Excise (Amendment) Bill which he presented in parliament for second reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penza is seeking to amend the Customs and Excise Act so as to, among other things, harmonize the Act with that of the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) Act of 1993, strengthen the powers of the Commissioner of Customs and Excise in the implementation of the Act, strengthen various sections concerned with compliance and enforcement and revise the nomenclature of the tariff and the rates of duty for Customs and Excise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Bwana Mkubwa MMD member of parliament, Andrew Kashita, told Penza that this proposals do not address the fundamental freedoms of citizens and the rule of law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kashita said that some of the things Penza was proposing in the bill were not in his budget speech. He was particularly concerned about clause 5 sub section 7 of the bill which empowers the Commissioner of Customs and Excise to go to any bank and get information on individuals' bank accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We should be careful otherwise we will go back to the days of Special Investigation Team for Economy and Trade (SITET) which was used to fix certain individuals,&quot; Kashita said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was supported by Kafue MMD member of parliament, Yusuf Badat who wondered why the government wanted to give the ZRA additional powers when it managed to collect 35 per cent more than the targeted revenue last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The key problem is at the point of entry. There is chaos, no orderliness and the infra structure is run down,&quot; Badat charged. He said the solution was to give customs officers at points of entry arresting powers, minimise the harassment of people and have a disciplined customs staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we are going to give the ZRA powers to seize goods and search banks, we are going to have an organisation similar to SITET,&quot; Badat added. However, Penza rebuffed the claims saying &quot;the purpose of the legislation was essentially to curb smuggling and money laundering&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The ruling Movement For Multiparty Democrary (MMD) has finally distributed 46 of the 80 vehicles it imported from South Africa late last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 46 vehicles were parked at State House and last Saturday and Sunday number plates and their respective destinations were being fitted and painted on them by government employees. And 36 of these vehicles were parked at State House's old guest house and 11 at Nkwazi House. The work on the vehicles was being supervised by Presidential aide Fabian Mumba.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MMD national secretary, Michael Sata refused to confirm this saying &quot;the vehicles had nothing to do with the The Post.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People are phoning me about more important things and you want to talk about MMD cars,&quot;Sata complained in a telephone interview yesterday. &quot;What have those cars got to do with you? Are they yours?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But defense minister, Ben Mwila last October confirmed the purchase of the 80 vehicles to be used for party campaigns during the local government and presidential and general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was understood at the time that 80 drivers from the military intelligence had been sent to South Africa to pick up the vehicles at a cost of K63 million in maintenance allowances. Mwila denied the exercise was at the expense of the government. &quot;It is the party which has bought these vehicles and there is nothing wrong for us to use the military because we are paying for their expenses,&quot; Mwila said in interview last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time, 47 drivers from different government institutions and private organisations have been delegated the job of making sure the vehicles are taken to their various destinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the drivers were addressed by President Chiluba on Saturday in the presence of Sata. The President advised the drivers to move safely saying the vehicles were for the party and that he would thank (reward) them very much upon their return. He is also said to have told the drivers that he was confident of winning the elections and that the vehicles were meant to boost the campaign at district level.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The problem of voter apathy seems to be one which has defied all efforts to solve. Clearly,one of the reasons why voters shun the polls in this country is because they feel that the entire exercise is a total waste of time. &quot;Why should I waste my time registering to vote?&quot; a middle-aged civil servant asked me recently. &quot;These people (politicians) are just the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the numerous civic education campaigns aimed at encouraging the citizens of this country to exercise their franchise, this cynical attitude is widespread among the citizenry and poses a real danger to the survival of our fledgling democracy. But how can it be changed and how can the ordinary folk of this nation be persuaded to participate in the democratic process by voting?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obviously people will not change their attitudes unless they are convinced that their votes will make a difference in the political equation, and this goes beyond merely deciding whether it is Mr A or Mr B that will represent them in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If both Mr A and Mr B happen to be hopeless candidates with nothing to offer to the people, as has too often been the case in some constituencies, then the election of one or the other makes little difference to the voters either way and they are unlikely to be motivated to go to the polls next time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let's face it, the calibre of some of our parliamentary candidates leaves a great deal to be desired, to say the least. You cannot realistically expect a semi-literate, debt-ridden political chancer to go into the National Assembly and do a good job of representing his constituency. There are cases of members of parliament who have sat in the house for many years and said nothing of substance. With such people offering themselves as candidates, it is not surprising that voters are not enthusiastic about entering the polling booths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political parties must be more serious about the candidates they adopt if they want people to respond to the call for them to particparte in the electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact there is need to establish minimum standards for MPs and only those meeting the laid down criteria should be allowed to stand. A basic level of education and a demonstrable ability to contribute effectively to the business of the house should be essential criteria. MPs should also be compelled by law to visit their constituencies a minimum specified number of times per year and to initiate development projects in their areas. They should also make themselves available to the people in their constituencies for consultation and to report on their activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such measures are necessary to ensure that only individuals of high calibre find their way to Manda Hill. It is not fair to the electorate for unscrupulous political charlatans to cheat their way into parliament with sweet stories and once there to concentrate on enriching themselves, ignoring the suffering masses who voted for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such a state of affairs does not augur well for democracy at all. It is therefore a matter of priority for minimum standards of performance for MPs and candidates to be set because we can only strengthen the voters' confidence in the electoral system and boost their willingness to vote by presenting them with quality candidates to choose from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last presidential and general elections, the question of quality was completely overlooked in the headlong rush to get rid of UNIP. The consequences of that haste can be clearly seen in the quality (or lack of it) of some of the individuals who wormed their way into parliament in 1991. We should place a definite emphasis on quality in the forthcoming elections if we want see an end to voter apathy in Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Two Post editors and a columnist found with a contempt of parliament case to answer by Speaker Robinson Nabulyato await a minimum of four months in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nabulyato, on Tuesday this week found Post editor-in-chief and managing director Fred M'membe, managing editor Bright Mwape and columnist Lucy Sichone guilty of violating the parliamentary privileges act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nabulyato referred the matter to the Standing Orders committee dominated by the ruling MMD party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our duty as a committee is to see what punishment can be meted out. We have a maximum of twelve months with hard labour to think about and with mitigating circumstances a more reasonable sentence will be reached,&quot; said a source who is a member of the Standing Orders Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The source did not rule out speculation that the MMD dominated committee intended to use its position to achieve what the government has failed in courts and give the two editors a sentence of at least four months imprisonment with hard labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The member of the Standing Orders Committee also revealed that minister of legal affairs Remmy Mushota was expected today to raise a point of order on an article &quot;Miyanda and Patel in their Master's shadow&quot; by another Post editor Masautso Phiri which appeared in the Wednesday February 21, edition of the paper. The standing orders committee is chaired by Speaker of the National Assembly Robinson Nabulyato.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the MMD members of parliament are today expected to hold a caucus meeting at 8:30 hours. By press time yesterday it was not known whether the ruling party caucus would be addressed by President Chiluba or by the Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Rikki Illilonga has shut down his multi million Kwacha recording studios in Lusaka's show grounds because of what he termed &quot;undue frustrations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Illilonga said Wednesday that he has been prompted to close down the studios set up last year because some people owning some stands in the show grounds were threatening his landlord, whom he named, with eviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have closed the damn studio because a clique of some businessmen did not like my presence there and complained that I was making noise with my music,&quot; he said adding, &quot;apparently they did not like some people who patronised the premises for fear of a break-in.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Illilonga has since decided to look for land to construct his own studio to be called Bongo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have started looking for a piece of land to set up my ultra-modern studio near Soweto market. But I wouldn't like to disclose the amount of investment and I am hopeful it will be operational before the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The setting up of the studio was intended to serve as an alternative for musicians to record and produce their music after the demise of Teal Record Company in Ndola last year which has left most of them in the cold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Illilonga, now based in Denmark used the same studio to record his single titled &quot;Viva City&quot; in praise of Lusaka premier league side City of Lusaka football club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Illilonga chided government for failing to recognise the role musicians played in making Zambia gain a cultural identity on the international scene.  He has called for the implementation of the musicians living wage and copyright protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This government has a moral obligation to ensure that musicians are given a living wage inspite of the royalties from their works,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;Countries in Europe, take the state as a partner in the success of artists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On whether he recognises the role of Zambia Union of Musicians (ZUM) in ensuring the protection of copyright and composers are adhered and promoted, Illilonga carped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Forget about ZUM, it has been a non starter from the onset. What we need now is government's direct protection of musicians' copyright,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;In Denmark I pay 100 per month to Danish Musician's Union as a guarantee for the safety of my life and welfare. Why can't the government do the same, ZUM has not been helpful all along and it is up to the government to protect its artists.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tembo, 36, died on February 6 at UTH after an illness and was buried at Leopards hill cemetary in what the artistic fraternity has described as an&quot; eradication of artistic talent in the country&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - Six months after the ground breaking conference in Asmara, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) leadership returned once more to the Eritrean capital in January in order to formulate a strategy leading to the overthrow of the National Islamic Front(NIF) regime. Meeting between 12 and 15 January, the NDA leadership adopted measures concerning both the political and military struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting was chaired by the NDA chairperson, Mohamed Osman El Mirghani of the Democratic Unionist Party(DUP), and was attended by representatives of all the member groups. Alamin Mohamed Said, secretary general of the Popular Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) of Eritrea, attended the conference on behalf of the Eritrean government, whilst Fatima Ahmed Ibrahim attended as an observer for the Sudanese Women's Movement. The following resolutions and recommendations were adopted at the Asmara leadership conference:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the Political Plane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1) The NDA Leadership Council unanimously reaffirms that the first choice for the NDA is the unity of the people of Sudan based on choice and free will, which is, in turn, based on citizenship, equality and justice. The NDA leadership also reaffirms its commitment to the right of Self-determination as contained in the Asmara Declaration of June 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (2) The NDA leadership further affirms that the unity of the Sudanese opposition movement on issues of destiny, which was achieved during the Asmara conference in June, is the only basis for achieving the implementation of the Asmara resolutions. The leadership resolves to maintain that unity until the people of Sudan achieve that implementation, which is the best basis for achieving the political objectives of all the people of Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (3) The NDA leadership resolves to accelerate and redouble its efforts in the political and military fields in accordance with the plans to bring about a quick overthrow of the NIF regime, now that the political vision for the future of the country is clear and the national, regional and international climate is favourable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (4) The NDA leadership resolves to strengthen and promote the institutions of the alliance to keep pace with national, regional and international developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (5) The NDA leadership resolves to provide the Sudan People's Liberation Army(SPLA) with all material support, so that the SPLA will maintain and sustain the military initiative which it has enjoyed since its successful offensive of October 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (6) The NDA leadership resolves to strengthen its media organs to expose the external isolation of the NIF regime, to support the unity of the opposition inside the country, and to protect and safeguard that unity to enable the internal opposition to launch a popular uprising to overthrow the NIF regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (7) The NDA leadership resolves to mobilise international public opinion and support for the cause of democracy and freedom in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (8) The NDA leadership resolves to boycott the elections charade that the regime has announced it intends to hold in 1996, believing that it is merely designed to improve the regime's image internationally and will not be a true exercise in democracy. Furthermore, the leadership resolves to mobilise the Sudanese public to boycott the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regional and International Planes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1) The NDA leadership welcomes the international condemnation and isolation of the NIF regime, and particularly appreciates the resolutions in December 1995 of the United Nations General Assembly, which condemned the regime's human rights record and the resurgence of the slave trade in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (2) The NDA leadership welcomes the outcome of the London Conference of November 1995 and applauds its resolutions, which are a step forward towards the attainment of peace and democracy in Sudan, because they have combined the Asmara Declaration with the Declaration of Principles of the Intergovernmental Authority for Drought and Development(IGADD) committee on peace in Sudan. This has given an impetus to the search for peace and democracy and has provided the opportunity for the Sudanese opposition outside of the NDA to share its views on the future of Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (3) The NDA leadership registers its satisfaction with the regional initiative to contain the recent conflict between Eritrea and the Yemen, particularly the roles of Egypt and Ethiopia, which enabled the conflict to move away from military confrontation to a peaceful resolution through mediation and arbitration in accordance with international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (4) The NDA leadership registers a vote of thanks to all the governments and international organisations that have supported the just cause of the people of Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (5) The NDA leadership calls on all the countries that support the NIF regime with arms and ammunition to refrain from doing so and to prevent their weapons being used against the people of Sudan. The leadership, furthermore, wishes to assure all the governments which support the regime that the NDA does indeed represent all the social and political groups in Sudan other than the NIF and wants to avoid any situation which may complicate relationships with those governments once the regime has been overthrown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Terrorism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1) The NDA leadership condemns the NLIF regime for using terrorism against the people of Sudan ad for exporting it to the Arab, Islamic and African worlds. The leadership also condemns the regime's sponsorship of international terrorist groups whose presence in Sudan is destroying resources and creating insecurity for a people renowned for their religious tolerance and rejection of all forms of terrorist violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (2) The NDA leadership condemns the NIF regime for its part in the assassination attempt on the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa last June, as well as for its refusal to hand over to Ethiopia the Sudanese and foreign terrorists responsible for that outrage who have since sought sanctuary inside Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (3) The NDA leadership supports the complaint made by the Ethiopian government to the Organisation for African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations Security Council concerning the terrorist activities of the NIF regime, and urges the two organisations to impose wide ranging sanctions with the intention of forcing the regime to hand over the terrorist suspects and to close down the terrorist training camps inside Sudan, which are a constant threat to the security of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (4) The NDA leadership calls on the international community to impose an oil and armaments embargo on the NIF regime so as to frustrate the regime's criminal activities against the people of Sudan, and prevent it from destabilising and undermining the security of neighbouring states. The leadership also calls on the international community to check and control the regime's capacity to subvert international order and security through the imposition of sanctions similar to those imposed on other rogue regimes around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other Decisions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NDA leadership also approved the applications for membership of the NDA by the Sudan Federal Alliance led by the veteran politician from Darfur, Ahmed Ibrahim Diraige, and the Sudanese Women's Movement. Mr. Diraige is likely to be invited to join the eleven member leadership council at the next NDA conference scheduled to take place within the next three months. Such an invitation can only be issued by the full conference. The January meeting also allowed Fatima Ahmed Ibrahim to attend as an observer, representing the Sudanese women until the next meeting of the full conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No DUP Controversy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the January meeting, there had been press reports that the DUP's commitment to the Asmara Declaration of June 1995 was a half-hearted one, and that it had refused to sign the document last June because it wanted to change the wording of some of the resolutions and clauses. Some of the Sudanese newspapers published from Cairo sought to play on this imaginary disagreement within the NDA, simply because they were themselves opposed to Self-determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The January meeting dispelled the rumours, as the DUP had never made any conditions about the document. True, the DUP had been concerned that the clause on unity ought to be at the forefront of the document, but had never suggested alterations to the contents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DUP's concerns about drafting will be tabled for discussion at the next full NDA conference. Meanwhile, the Asmara Declaration of last June has been signed by the representative of the DUP and countersigned by Sayed Mohamed Osman El Mirghani himself in his capacity as chairman of the NDA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of the very positive developments at Asmara in January, &quot;Al Khartoum&quot; newspaper, which had been at the forefront of the campaign to create divisions within the NDA over the question of Self-determination, ran a headline on 16 January suggesting that the NDA had endorsed all the DUP's amendments which would place the emphasis on unity rather than Self-determination. It is a fact of life, however, that even when proved wrong, some newspaper editors have a habit of creating controversy where none actually exists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - In the middle of January, the United Nations Security Council considered the Ethiopian government's request that the National Islamic Front(NIF) regime hand over for extradition three terrorist suspects implicated in the June 1995 assassination attempt on Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. The regime's minister of foreign affairs attempted to cloud the issue by asking the Security Council to debate an alleged invasion of Sudan by Ethiopian forces, but this crude attempt at sabotaging the main debate was quickly dealt with out of hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime's foreign minister, Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, left New York with little to show for the price of his air ticket. He had clearly failed to side-track the Security Council and had to relay the news back to Khartoum that the regime was merely being given time in which to comply with the Ethiopian request.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Issues of Terrorism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Security Council plainly considered the issues of international terrorism to be more significant than any run of the mill border dispute between the two countries. The council urged the NIF regime to cooperate with the Ethiopians by extraditing the three suspected terrorists to Addis Ababa.  This urging did not amount to a full resolution, which would have required near instant compliance or the risk of punitive sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As it stands, Khartoum has been given an unspecified time to comply with the request while the issue will remain on the council's agenda. If and when the council considers that a reasonable time has elapsed without compliance, the issue will be considered once more by the council and a formal resolution is likely to be issued. Punitive action would then become automatic if the regime insisted upon non-compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ethiopian Case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime's international standing has been further damaged, even if it were to comply in full with the Security Council's request, because it has been formally documented as a pariah state which sponsors international terrorism. Khartoum's denials have become totally unbelievable and unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ethiopian investigation into the failed assassination attempt concluded that the Khartoum regime was directly involved in the plot and had assisted in its planning and execution. This was revealed in a report published last September, thirty-two days after the outrage. At that time, the Ethiopians had come to the conclusion and made it plain that no interests would be further served by covering up the Sudanese involvement. Quiet diplomatic attempts to persuade Khartoum to extradite the three terrorist suspects had failed between June and September, and so the Ethiopians had little option but to go public with their findings. Khartoum's intransigence since September, in spite of a valid extradition treaty between Sudan and Ethiopia, left Addis Ababa with little option other than to take its case to the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Flawed Arguments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NIF regime has presented a flawed argument in defence of its position. Ignoring the evidence of the quiet diplomacy which took place in the period between the end of June and the beginning of September, the regime has sought to use the time which elapsed between the outrage and the publication of the Ethiopian report as a reason why it is in no position to hand over the terrorist suspects. Khartoum has implied that the terrorists, if they were ever in Sudan, have long since departed and are beyond their jurisdiction. Khartoum has blamed Ethiopia's speed of response to the outrage as the reason why it cannot hand over the suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through its request, the Security Council has shown that it does not believe the NIF regime's version of events. The Security Council, especially its five permanent members, cannot be seen to be sanctioning assassination attempts on heads of state, and so had little option than to back up the Ethiopian case. Now Khartoum must deliver the three terrorists or face the music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No Evidence of Invasion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NIF regime claimed in January that Ethiopian forces had invaded Sudan, captured five border villages and moved seventy miles into Sudanese territory. No evidence was presented to back up this claim, and the Ethiopian authorities denied that any border incidents had taken place, let alone a full scale invasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ethiopian government has stated that it would hardly jeapardise its very strong case against the NIF regime by invading Sudan. For its part, the Security Council instructed Khartoum to pursue its case against Addis Ababa with the relevant UN bodies and agencies that regularly deal with border disputes between member nations. Meanwhile, the NIF regime has made no request for the UN to send observers to the border region to witness at first hand the alleged invasion, which would have seemed a logical move to make in the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are, of course, other reasons why the NIF regime has decided to target Ethiopia as the villain of its propaganda piece. With diplomatic relations between Sudan and Eritrea suspended, and Asmara's public declaration of support for the Sudanese opposition National Democratic Alliance(NDA), there would be little to be gained from targeting Eritrea. The Eritrean government would be unlikely to rise to the bait. The regime dearly wants to convince its dwindling number of international supporters that it is the victim of a regional conspiracy because of its &quot;civilisational orientation&quot;, a euphemism for Islamic Fundamentalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever Khartoum's reason for spreading the invasion story, it certainly backfired at the Security Council. It now remains to be seen whether the regime will comply with the Security Council's request over the terrorist suspects. If not, it must be clear that the Security Council will not let the matter rest there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bal Harbour, Florida - Despite increasing international criticism and isolation, the renegade regime of General Sani Abacha continues on a course of widespread violation of the most basic rights of Nigerian citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Violence and illegal arrests continue, much of which has been targeted against the country's trade unions and their leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among those under detention is Brother Frank Kokori, general secretary of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), arrested July 4, 1994, who remains in prison without charge.  Milton Dabibi, general secretary of the Nigerian oil and gas workers' union PENGASSAN, was arrested last month and is also being held without charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AFL-CIO, in solidarity with Nigeria's independent trade unions, believes that more effective and forceful measures are urgently needed to force the Abacha regime to stop the violence and torture, restore civil liberties including an end to arbitrary arrests, and immediately release all political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Specifically, the AFL-CIO joins others in calling for a complete embargo of Nigerian exports, sanctions on those organizations and nations that refuse to honor the embargo, and an embargo on shipment of equipment and replacement parts to Nigeria.  In addition, foreign bank accounts of Nigeria's ruling generals must be frozen and their stolen millions preserved for the Nigerian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ninety percent of Nigeria's foreign revenue comes from oil exports with nearly fifty percent of this oil exported to the United States.  For our part, the AFL-CIO will continue to do everything in its power to support Nigeria's besieged independent trade unions and to pressure U.S. oil companies to admit their culpability by easing their support of the Nigerian military regime which violently abuses human and worker rights to degrade the environment and make massive profits from the blood of its citizens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Geneva - Control measures instituted in Gabon by the Ministry of Health and an international medical team appear to be containing further spread of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the country, according to assessments by World Health Organization (WHO) team members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of cases and deaths from the disease have remained essentially unchanged during the past four days. All of the cases are reported to have originated in the village of Mayibout II, located in a remote area of northern Gabon.  Additional suspected cases are currently under surveillance in the same region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (&quot;Cases&quot; are persons confirmed by laboratory tests as being infected, or who develop a syndrome compatible with Ebola haemorrhagic fever and are known to have had contact with a source of infection. &quot;Suspected cases&quot; are persons who had contact with a source of infection and are exhibiting some symptoms of the disease.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having established sufficient control measures, the Ministry of Health and international medical team are now conducting a retrospective investigation of the outbreak. This will lay the groundwork for follow-up research into how the outbreak took place, and what can be learned from it about the natural host of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a press conference yesterday in Libreville, the Minister of Health, Dr Serge Mba Bekale, said that &quot;as soon as the government suspected that the illness in Mayibout might be due to infection with Ebola virus, and before the exact cause was known, all appropriate measures were taken to limit the outbreak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHO attributes the limited spread of the outbreak in Gabon to several key factors. One was the rapid response by the Ministry of Health in recognizing the threat at an early stage and reacting appropriately. Control measures included the isolation of actual and suspected cases, which reduced the odds of secondary infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another important factor was a large-scale information campaign conducted by the government to inform the public about haemorrhagic fever, its mode of transmission and ways to avoid infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, in contrast to last year's epidemic in Zaire which struck in an urban zone, the outbreak in Gabon occurred in a rural area with low population density, a natural advantage in limiting the further spread of infection. Some sporadic secondary cases of Ebola are nevertheless expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of particular concern to investigators was the possibility of secondary infections among health workers in the provincial hospital of Makokou, where the Ebola patients were admitted on 5-6 February. The 21-day incubation period is still in effect, but no health workers have manifested symptoms of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHO will continue to work with Ministries of Health in countries at risk to strengthen their capacity for responding to suspected outbreaks of Ebola haemorrhagic fever and to ensure that appropriate materials are available for preventing spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tunis - In order to add more transparency to stock market transactions the Tunis Stock Exchange (La Bourse) is to introduce real-time computer trading next June, announced Finance Minister Nouri Zorgati in a press briefing held today in Tunis. The minister noted also that the process of privatization of public firms will witness an increase in 1996 in sectors such as transportation, tourism, and industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twenty seven firms are scheduled to be privatized in 1996, versus 20 in 1995 thanks to the reorganization of La Bourse and the introduction of a new law last year regulating the activities of stock brokers and shifting the duties of oversight from La Bourse to a newly established Financial Market Council (Conceil du Marche Financier.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main objectives of the new reforms are to privatize one company per month and to introduce new mechanisms guaranteeing accurate and fast transactions through computerization.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Congress, in approving the Uruguay Round Trade Agreements in 1994, included a provision that the President should develop and implement a comprehensive trade and development policy for Africa, and present annual reports on its progress over a four-year period.  The first report, excerpted below, was presented on February 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initial reaction from Congress and from non-governmental organizations has been that the report falls far short of the stated objectives, pointing out that it is mainly a compilation of existing programs, includes an uncritical endorsement of questionable structural adjustment programs, and fails to address the critical issue of Africa's debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A bipartisan congressional caucus on Africa Trade and Investment is being formed, which will prepare its own response to the administration's policy over the next few months.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A COMPREHENSIVE TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT POLICY FOR THE COUNTRIES OF AFRICA A Report Submitted by the President of the United States to the Congress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This report presents a comprehensive policy framework through which the United States will pursue its trade and development strategy with the 48 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. Increased economic growth in Africa would not only stabilize the region financially and politically, but also create greater opportunities for U.S. businesses and investors and more jobs for Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To seize the opportunity for partnership aimed both at supporting African objectives and pursuing U.S. interests, this policy establishes a framework for supporting and facilitating African efforts to create an enabling environment for the promotion of trade, investment, and sustainable development. To address effectively the wide spectrum of challenges that confronts African development, the policy framework outlined in this report is structured around five basic objectives: trade liberalization and promotion; investment liberalization and promotion; development of the private sector; infrastructure enhancement; and economic and regulatory reform. This report offers a summary of these objectives and the initiatives being pursued in each area. This Administration is also opening a wider dialogue with interested parties in Africa and the United States for the purpose of sharpening the focus of the U.S. role in the years to come.  Developing a coherent strategy for promoting trade and development in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a coordinated effort among the Administration, the Congress and the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States recognizes the difficulties African countries have faced in their efforts to develop both human and economic capital. Problems such as overwhelming debt burdens, flawed economic policy choices, poverty and widespread unemployment, weak private sectors stifled by dominating parastatals, environmental degradation and an absence of democratic political institutions have combined in the past to hamper Africa's aspirations for growth and development. However, change has begun to sweep the African continent as countries are increasingly abandoning the discredited statist policies of the last three decades and committing to policy changes based upon democratic political principles and market-based economic reforms. This growing commitment to democracy and structural adjustment inspires optimism about the future of Africa and provides new opportunities for the United States both to support African efforts and to pursue American economic and security interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, African countries have begun to recognize the critical importance of creating a policy environment conducive to investment and growth. A recent World Bank report documents a direct correlation between those countries that have embarked on major policy reforms and those that have experienced the greatest economic growth. In addition, the report shows that bilateral and multilateral assistance have been instrumental in supporting a stable policy environment. This allows reforms the time necessary to take hold and has helped catalyze private investment, which will be the engine of future growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenge is to promote increased growth, often drawing upon the continent's fragile but rich resource base, in a manner which is sustainable and promotes individual initiative and private investment. Many countries are making significant progress in implementing policies which promote the husbanding of the resource base, however, environmental concerns still threaten many short term growth options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between 1990 and 1994, the United States provided $13.6 billion in all forms of bilateral and multilateral assistance to Africa. These funds promoted trade and development, helped develop the private sector, enhanced infrastructure, supported economic and regulatory reform, encouraged democracy, provided technical assistance and food aid, and helped stem environmental degradation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, multilateral institutions have also played a major role in assisting development in Sub-Saharan Africa: between 1993 and 1995, the World Bank Group provided over $3.7 billion for structural adjustment, private sector development and civil service reform in Africa; the International Monetary Fund had total credit outstanding to Africa of about $9 billion as of June 1995 to promote viable financial and balance of payments positions; and the African Development Bank committed over $13.6 billion to Africa (including North Africa) between 1990 and 1994 to support policy reform and economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, resources available to the United States Government, multilateral institutions and others providing official development assistance to Africa are in decline. This requires U.S. policy to focus on appropriate allocation of available funds and on successfully attracting more private sector participation and investment. U.S. policy will also seek to increase cooperation among donor nations and multilateral institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This report outlines a comprehensive trade and development policy for the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa aimed at accelerating economic growth. It first notes the policy challenges and the reforms necessary for economic development and social stability. It then offers a brief summary of the critical policy choices the countries of Africa have made. After reviewing both bilateral and multilateral policies and programs currently in operation, this report defines objectives and new initiatives for increasing trade and development in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> II. POLICY STATEMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The primary objective of the Administration's Comprehensive Trade and Development Policy is to work with the people and leaders of Africa in the pursuit of increased trade and investment, and sustainable economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Achievement of these objectives would, in turn, enable the countries of Africa to become more fully integrated into the global economy and share in the prosperity enjoyed by participating countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The thrust of this policy is captured in the following passage from the Communique from the June 1995 G-7 Halifax Summit which appeared under the heading of Promoting Sustainable Development:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A higher quality of life for all people is the goal of sustainable development. Democracy, human rights, transparent and accountable governance, investment in people and environmental protection are the foundations of sustainable development. The primary responsibility rests with each country but bilateral and multilateral international cooperation is essential to reinforce national efforts. We are committed to securing substantial flows of funds and to improving the quality of our assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As this statement makes clear, the responsibility rests with African countries to commit themselves to these objectives and to make the policy choices that will enable them to achieve these objectives. Help from outside Africa cannot overcome lack of commitment or wrong choices by the governments or people of Africa. However, if the commitment is there and the right choices are made, external assistance can make a valuable difference. The commitment and right choices now being made by a number of African countries give us ample reason to re-energize our efforts and to join with those countries in a partnership to pursue our mutual interests in democracy, political stability and economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These historic policy changes offer a critical opportunity to the United States. By supporting African countries in the pursuit of their development objectives, many of our own interests -- from the promotion of American trade to international security concerns -- can be advanced simultaneously.  Economic development in Africa will mean expanded trade with the United States, resulting in economic growth and new jobs for Americans as well as for Africans. The continued development of democratic institutions in Africa will not only stabilize the environment for this economic growth but will also help counter forces that threaten U.S. security, such as terrorism, refugee flows, narcotics trafficking, humanitarian crises, and environmental degradation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strengthening the synergies between trade and development is a major objective in U.S. policy toward Africa. The successful experiences of East and Southeast Asia demonstrate that rapid expansion of trade leads to rapid economic growth and employment. The resulting increase in incomes, in turn, leads to greater foreign and domestic investment and increased demand for foreign goods and services. Foreign development assistance is replaced by increased trade and foreign and domestic private investment. Development then becomes self-sustaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Creating a more hospitable environment for private investment is critical to the success of Africa's development. We are in an era of declining official development assistance, both bilateral and multilateral.  Future official aid programs will not be large enough to provide all, or even the majority, of the financing needed for Africa's development. Instead, they increasingly will serve to prepare the policy and management context for, and to catalyze, inflows of private capital. The emphasis, whether in aid councils or business development activities, must be on supporting those countries that show a willingness and ability to implement reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the current fiscal constraints faced by the United States, the Administration will not request any additional funding at this time. Funding for these activities will come from within current budgets. Moreover, since the budgets of the agencies participating in this policy are expected to decline in the short-term, it is probable that current levels of activities may even decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States will focus its support on those countries in Africa that are pursuing meaningful structural adjustment and economic reform because they have the greatest chance of success. Specifically, the United States will:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * join in multilateral efforts to assist those African countries undertaking meaningful economic and regulatory reform, including debt reduction where warranted;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * support efforts to improve essential government and non-government institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * support efforts to improve physical infrastructure needed in a modern market economy;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * create a more growth-oriented business climate that will attract foreign as well as domestic investment and generate expanded trade in which U.S. firms can participate as effective commercial partners;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * remove barriers to trade in Africa and increase African participation in the world trading system, including the WTO, in the U.S. GSP program, and strengthen intellectual property protection;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown today announced that he will lead a commercial development mission to Sub-Saharan Africa February 17-25, 1996 to advocate for increased U.S. trade in the region.  Brown will encourage local representatives of U.S. companies in Africa and international lending executives to join him in discussions with government leaders representing nearly 40 African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown will visit Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and Botswana.  During the Botswana visit Brown will represent the United States at a meeting of the 12-member Southern African Development Community (SADC). He will hold multi-lateral discussions in Cote d'Ivoire and Kenya and bi-lateral meetings in Ghana and Uganda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prior to departing on the mission, Brown will meet with U.S. corporate executives interested in doing business with Africa. During his mission, Brown will identify specific opportunities for U.S. businesses and bring together U.S. corporate executives, lenders, and government leaders to address issues concerning U.S. commercial interests. Brown also plans to meet with African business interests to explore methods to encourage more trade with the United States. &quot;Trade is a two-way street. We want to see African businesses succeed in trade with the United States just as we anticipate expanded opportunities for U.S. companies doing business in Africa,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown pointed out that private investment in Africa, when coupled with sound government, economic and social policies, has delivered exceptional returns. In 1993, U.S. companies enjoyed a return on investment of over 25 percent in Africa, where similar ventures in all developing countries equaled only 17 percent. This can be compared with a return on investment in developed countries of less than 9 percent. &quot;These outstanding economic results demonstrate the exceptional opportunities offered by progressive African countries,&quot; Brown added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trip is planned in conjunction with release of Clinton Administration's Africa trade and development policy report to Congress. The report, released this week, encourages African countries to liberalize trade and investment policies within a framework of democratic initiatives, market-based policies and creation of an enabling business environment.  &quot;Investors want to see open, democratic societies and efficient, frugal government management of public resources,&quot; Brown said. The Clinton plan centers on encouraging individual African governments to embrace socio-economic reform, regulatory restructuring, and the lowering and leveling of barriers to trade and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown stated that he will stress the Clinton Administration's commitment to democratic values, market-based economic policies, increased regional integration and aggressive competition for a large share of African trade.  &quot;Europe's era of economic dominance and trade hegemony in Africa is over,&quot; Brown said. Citing President Clinton's report to Congress, Brown explained that the U.S. share of Sub-Saharan Africa's markets stood at only 7.7 percent in 1994, while the European Union captured over 40 percent of these markets.  &quot;The United States will no longer cede these important markets to former colonial powers and we will support a policy of democracy, human rights, fiscal responsibility and regional cooperation to achieve our goals,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Clinton Administration's plan is to level the commercial playing field by offering responsible African governments and businesses top-level access to the strongest and most innovative capital market in the world---the United States. &quot;This initiative will mean more prosperity for Africans and more jobs for Americans,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meetings and conferences with government officials, international lending institution representatives and the private sector will focus on encouraging regional economic partnerships. &quot;Most of the small Sub-Saharan African countries simply cannot compete in the global market standing alone.  Just look at the rest of the world. The Europeans have strong trading bloc, we have a successful partnership in the Americas, and Asian economic coalitions are getting stronger every day. Market survival today depends on forging strong bonds with your neighbors through sound government economic policies, elimination of trade barriers and a peaceful social structure supported by democratic principles. This is the way to grow and prosper into the next century,&quot; Brown added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - This year's first rains have come two months earlier than expected in most parts of the country. Which has raised some concerns among our farming population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many farmers are just in a state of confusion. They do not know whether to respond to the rains by planting crops or not. Besides, most of them were caught unprepared with the fields not yet cleared while others were still harvesting the last crops.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The worries by the peasants are not unfounded. There's the temptation to respond to the rains by planting because of a number of reasons. The pattern of the rainy seasons could be changing. In which case if they do not plant now they might miss the season since it's unlikely the rains will continue through the usual months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other fear is that if they responded by planting, the early rains could have been just a teaser and could stop with the crops having barely found life in the ground. In which case their labour would have been lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The worst fear is that of famine and hunger in the event that they miss the season as they keep contemplating. So what do they do in the circumstances?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somebody somewhere in the Agriculture Department ought to have come out on this question. But, perhaps not surprising, it's mum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This inertia is unpardonable. It's common knowledge that Uganda depends on agriculture, not only for food, but also for our exports as well. In which case we would be taking anything to do with weather like something threatening our life line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, as some foresighted peasant farmers think, the disruption in the rain patterns spell famine and hunger. In these circumstances, people need to stock a big chunk of their most recent harvest in preparation for the likely harsh times ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even without the early rains, the weather in Uganda has a tendency to change for the worst almost every three years on average. So when drought strikes, in most instances it would have been expected. There's no need to wait and react like we've been taken by surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a lot of expert knowledge lying idle which would help the farmers cope with the consequences in the changing weather pattern. All someone has to do is put it out--just five minutes a day on state radio for a week will do wonders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - The Uganda national team, the Cranes, have been readmitted and drawn in the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations -- the continent's most prestigious soccer meet-- The Monitor learnt late last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The man credited with this feat is Kenya Football Federation boss, Job Omino, who used his regional CAF executive membership credentials to save Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The draws were made last Friday in South Africa without the Uganda Cranes, following the failure of FUFA to enter the team for the tournament whose finals will be played in Burkina Faso.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I talked to CAF Secretary Mustapha Fahmy and CAF president Issa Hayatou and we agreed in principle to re-admit Uganda,&quot; Omino told &quot;The Monitor&quot; last night on phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Following this turn of events, Uganda Cranes have now been drawn in Group Three,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda Cranes will play against Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco and Senegal, from which the two top nations shall qualify for the finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The round-robin matches for Group Three kick off in October with a match between Egypt and Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omino revealed that he learnt Uganda's fate last Friday, after receiving a call from one time UFA Secretary, Sam Kiwanuka, while in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was shameful--I had to react fast to convince both my bosses in CAF to re-admit Uganda. CAF will communicate to you about the rest of the details,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Council of Sports(NCS) General Secretary, Abbey Lutaya, had earlier on told The Monitor that Uganda's failure to pay the US$240 registration fee was due to lack of commitment within FUFA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Efforts by &quot;The Monitor&quot; to talk to FUFA boss, Twaha Kakaire, proved futile as he was reported to be in a closed door meeting, while the General Secretary Chris Rwanika, was reported to be in Kabale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, the news of Uganda's missing out in the 21st Africa Nations Cup draws took soccer fans by surprise and shock. The whole soccer fraternity was baying for the entire FUFA executive to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the blame was put on FUFA Secretary Chris Rwanika. But Rwanika shot back--saying that, it was &quot;sheer rubbish&quot;. He said his colleagues were using him as a scapegoat to cover up for their own shortcomings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, in a meeting last night, FUFA made several amendments, among which is the removal of a rule which prohibits a player from moving to another club before serving a term of three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With effect from next year, players will be free to move from one club to another after serving one year. But a club will not lose more than four players in a season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clubs representing the country in the CAF inter-clubs tournaments will not lose more than two players.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maputo - Text of Media Alert from the Media Institute of Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Internet edition of The Post newspaper of February 5 - banned by President Frederick Chiluba in terms of Section 53 of the Penal Code - has been removed from the paper's World Wide Web (WWW) site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark Bennet of Zamnet Communications, the privately-owned Internet service provider which hosts The Post's WWW site, says Zamnet was left with little choice but to make the February 5 edition of The Post inaccessible on the Internet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bennet says Zamnet kept the banned version of The Post on the WWW for two days after it was published, but was then warned by a &quot;someone senior in the police&quot; that the company was liable to be raided and charged with possession of a prohibited publication.  The President's ban of edition 401 of The Post covered &quot;all forms&quot; of the paper, says Bennet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Visit The Post's WWW site (http://www.zamnet.zm) and you will find the February 5 edition listed in the paper's archive of back editions, but click on the edition and the file will not open. However, following editions of the paper - containing stories about the banning, the police raid on The Post's offices, and subsequent arrest and charging of Editor-in-Chief Fred M'membe, Managing Editor Bright Mwape and Special Projects Editor Matsautso Phiri with contravening the State Security Act - can be read. The State Security Act charges relate to a report published in the February 5 edition of The Post revealing the government's plans to hold a referendum on the adoption of a new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recent addition to the Zamnet WWW site is &quot;Zambia Today&quot; - stories from the state-run news agency ZANA, which are up-dated every couple of hours. &quot;State House was very keen that the world didn't see The Post newspaper alone,&quot; said Bennet. &quot;We kept telling them that we were going to keep The Post, but that we were happy to put up a State House page, or a page for ZANA. We are trying to actively encourage them to be positive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bennet stresses Zamnet was an independent company and would not succumb to self-censorship as a result of political pressure. Zamnet is housed at the University of Zambia, which has a 52 per cent share holding in the company.  Although funded by the government, the University enjoys academic autonomy, says Bennet, &quot;so there is no possibility of pressure (being exerted on Zamnet) through the University&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe, Mwape and Phiri are due to appear in the High Court today to hear whether or not their bail - granted last week Wednesday (February 7) after initially being turned down by a magistrate - can be reviewed. If the court decides their bail can be reviewed, the three stand a chance of returning to jail to await trail on the charges of contravening Section 4 of the State Security Act, which prohibits the publication of classified information. If convicted, the journalists could be jailed for up to 25 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, speaking on Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) news this morning (February 16), Mwape said he was not deterred by the prospect of a lengthy term in jail if convicted. &quot;It is about time such a challenge was made,&quot; said Mwape. &quot;The freedom we are talking about will only come if we are prepared to make sacrifices for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Five foreign companies have shown interest in turning the &quot;'new' United National Independence Party (UNIP) headquarters&quot; into a hotel and work is expected to commence before the year ends, sources in the tourism ministry disclosed to The Post on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Albion of India, AITA and three other USA companies are said to have indicated their willingness to invest in the 10-storey building after a meeting with tourism minister Gabriel Maka in London last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Officials of these companies will arrive in the country next month to conduct feasibility studies,&quot; the source said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The source said more than K3 billion to transform the structure, which was initially designed for office accommodation, into a hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Sheraton group of hotels of USA, who had conducted feasibility studies in February, last year seem to have lost interest in the project, forcing the government to look elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have asked the prospective investors to come and assess the structure and tender after conducting feasibility studies,&quot; the source said.  &quot;We will pick the one with enough capital to run it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Hotels Catering Association of Zambia (HCAZ) and the Tour Operators Association doubt the feasibility of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government should sell the structure and plough the money into tourism because it is not ideal for a hotel,&quot; HCAZ chairman Gaudenzio Rossi said in an interview on Tuesday. &quot;It will be costly to transform the project than it did to build it because it is lacking several facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rossi added: &quot;The government has been saying they have talked to this one and that one but nothing is materialising. Why should we pretend?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Tour Operators Association chairman Mark Harvey also insisted the project will not make financial sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The building should be sold and utilised for office accommodation as no hotel firm will have the financial capacity to make the venture a reality,&quot; Harvey said in an interview last week. &quot;We totally agree with Rossi that government should sell the building and the money should go into tourism which has been given a paltry K8.9billion in this year's budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Political parties are proving more and more to be toothless bulldogs. Their role and relevance to society, particularly the disadvantaged is diminishing with alacrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the plural party political era we are in, it is numbers that count.  Our opposition leaders may stand before cameras and smile, issue press statements, protest and demand, until the cows come home, but if there are no numbers to back their stands, they are toothless. With the current apathy towards politics, it is obviously quite difficult to mobilise support in sufficient numbers, to be taken seriously, however, this must be the main thrust of opposition parties, if they are to be of relevance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lest I be mistaken, I am not merely referring to the need to mobilise numbers towards a general election, but towards influencing parliamentary, government and civic decisions between elections. I am referring to an activity that I may term (innocently ) a &quot;flexing of muscles&quot; or a &quot;show down of strength&quot;. It is a tactic that would be used much in the same way that China conducts military manouvres off the coast of Taiwan!! Whilst it is not very neighbourly of China, it certainly keeps Taiwan and the Americans on their toes, and would similarly be ideal for keeping government on its toes.  The press, lobby groups, and other interested parties use the same tactic, in opinion polls. It tells decision makers what sort of support or opposition a particular decision will have, and is a very powerful tool in swaying the thinking of politicians particularly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recent banning of Post newspaper edition 401 is fertile ground for opposition parties to prove their worth, by standing by to defend those upon whom the full might of the State machinery is unjustly turned. When the Post edition was banned, some of its staff detained, and a ridiculous decision made threatening anyone found with a copy, with arrest, all parties should have rallied round.( not by unleashing Sebastian Zulu on unsuspecting and unwilling clients). Party cadres and leaders should have been offering K2,000.00 for every copy of that edition they could lay their hands on, also making photocopies, and sticking them on their cars, backs and other available spaces, to show solidarity. Can you imagine 10, 000 assorted party cadres and citizens (we would all join of course) pitching up with these papers and photocopies, at Central police station and other police stations countrywide, demanding to be arrested as law abiding citizens, in accordance with the decree from the Fuhrer. Aubenschweir Francis Ndhlovu SS would have a fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What has happened to the zeal and enthusiasm with which KK and his compatriots marched into prisons, jails and police stations, in defiance of unjust and discriminatory laws. Why didn't he lead UNIP to the police stations, in Lusaka, Copperbelt, Livingstone, Mongu, etc waving copies of the banned edition. What of Humphrey Mulemba and Aka, where is the manifestation of their support?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dean Mungomba could have posed for another full page pin up, this time with the Post 401 in hand! Dean may have been in diapers when KK was doing the rounds of jails in the 60s, but he could make use of Hazwell Banda who should be well versed with the art of mobilising &quot;monks from the ruins&quot;, and should have done so in ZADECO!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It may sound as though I am promoting anarchy, far from it, I am a true believer in and law order and justice, and honestly, who could describe an assembly of thousands of Zambian citizens at police stations, silently holding copies of The Post 401 as anarchy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I must however admit that when ridiculous decrees are made to suppress the rights of people, aiding government and its wings to change roles from protector of the oppressed to suppressor of the people, such decrees should not have support of any segment of society, and such lack of support should be evident. The act of banning the Post edition 401, was one of political cowardice, gross abuse of office. Discussions pertaining to the constitution, and its mode adoption, cannot at any stage of discussion, and in the wildest of dreams be considered a national secret. If cabinet wants to establish who is leaking the secrets, they should do it in the professional way, by instituting quiet and high skilled investigations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The depreciation of the kwacha will soon be halted as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors honour their pledges to Zambia, Bank of Zambia assured on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Explaining the poor performance of the kwacha, in response to a Post query, Bank of Zambia spokesman, Kabinga Pande, attributed the decline to high demand for foreign currency as a result of the new tax incentives in this year's budget and seasonal influences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The exchange rate is determined by the financial markets based on the demand for foreign exchange,&quot; Pande said in a statement on Friday. &quot;If demand outstrips supply there is pressure on the exchange rates to depreciate.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And according to Bank of Zambia, the tax incentives provided in this year's budget encouraged imports and consequently raised the demand for foreign currencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Incentives in the budget can also have an impact on the demand for foreign exchange,&quot; Pande said, &quot;particularly any measures taken to lower trade taxes and encourage growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bank of Zambia, however, noted that this has has become an annual trend.  There is always a rise in the demand for foreign currencies towards the close, and the earlier quarters of every year, as companies restock after the festive season. And it is also during this period that most companies remit dividends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And manager of Lusaka's Delta Bureau de Change, Adrian Banda, in an interview on Friday said: &quot;There is very high demand and the dollar is hard to come by. We don't have a stable rate.We have experienced rates going up by K5- K6 almost everyday in the last two weeks.The rates were stable at K965 from last year but they have risen to K1, 090.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bella Jhaveri the manager of Prudence Bureau de Change had a similar story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The US dollar has become scarce and beginning February there has been a sharp rise in the exchange rates due to high demand against little dollars in circulation,&quot; Jhaveri said in an interview on Friday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Journalists should not break up now because government still has intentions of creating a media council to license and regulate journalists, Press Association of Zambia President Francis Kasoma has pleaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kasoma, whose association has been threatened with a split, said it would be folly for PAZA members to be divided at a time such as this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have information that the government still intends to go ahead and create the media council and if that is done,&quot; Kasoma warned, &quot; it will be the end of media freedom in Zambia.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Copperbelt based journalists last week announced that they are organising a breakaway from PAZA unless Kasoma's &quot;silent&quot; executive calls an urgent extra-ordinary annual general meeting within two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Copperbelt journalists steering committee of Mike Moono, Victor Kaira and Pius Katwishi has accused PAZA of being docile and unrepresentative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;PAZA has been operating in isolation with an administration catering only for a small clique,&quot; Kaira charged in an interview last Friday. &quot;If the AGM is not held in the next two weeks we shall consider breaking away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kasoma warned that this would spell doom for all journalists in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We as PAZA have already taken the Chiluba government to court over the creation of a media council and if we start quarreling they will think we are not able to manage our affairs,&quot; Kasoma said. &quot;There is no way the government can force an organisation on us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kasoma said he would be travelling to the Copperbelt this week to meet the Moono group and discuss their concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I agree with them on the holding of the AGM in a neutral place but I want to meet them to discuss the logistical problems of holding the AGM outside a town where most of the executive members live,&quot; Kasoma said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kaira maintained nothing short of calling an AGM to choose new office bearers will be acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As per our ultimatum, two weeks is ample time to organise a meeting and if they think they are still popular enough then they will go through in the elections,&quot; Kaira said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are up to 30 PAZA journalists on the Copperbelt alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post and its staff last year withdrew its membership of PAZA claiming the association was almost 99 per cent dominated by government media journalists whose interests and concerns were, in most cases, very different from those of the independent media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The divide between us and journalists working for the government is clear to all. They are not targets of the authorities as they can easily deal with them administratively,&quot; Post editor for special projects Masautso Phiri said in an interview yesterday, adding: &quot;There are instances when the government has unleashed its journalists on us, to discredit us and our work in defence of State House lies. How can we be members of the same organisation?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Zambian economy is on track even though a few problems were being experienced, assured central bank governor, Jacob Mwanza in Livingstone on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanza disclosed in an interview that there was a lot of suspicion from both local and foreign investors at the performance of Zambian economy after the collapse of several banks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The closure of the banks was a normal practice and an indicator that such banks had bad shareholders and managers,&quot; Mwanza said.&quot;Only genuine and well managed banks would remain in the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank of Zambia governor maintained the failure of these banks should blamed on their managers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Banks went down due to people managing them with ultra motives,&quot; Mwanza charged. &quot;They did not have the interests of the depositors hence no one should blame the tough economical stand the government has taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanza, who is in Livingstone accompanying an IMF delegation led by E.  Calamitsis who is IMF director of the African department, said: &quot;More investors have instead shown interest in investing in Zambia even after learning that banks were collapsing which was an indicator that the economy was doing fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Calamitsis, in an earlier interview in Livingstone on Saturday, said the Zambian economy was doing fine even though the government has an uphill battle to convince people that what it was doing was the right thing. &quot;As an African, I know that it was difficult for poor countries like Zambia to claim to have a good economy and expect people to believe when the grassroots were suffering,&quot; Calamitsis said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Speaker of the National Assembly, Robinson Nabulyato, yesterday established a prima facie case against two Post journalists and a columnist for contempt of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nabulyato, who made the ruling after Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda raised a point of order on January 30, 1995 on three articles written by Post editor-in-chief Fred M'membe, managing editor Bright Mwape and columnist Lucy Sichone, has refered the matter to the standing committee of the house for further consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three articles referred to are &quot;What Will Replacing Public Order Act Mean&quot; by Fred M'membe and &quot;Miyanda Has Forgotten About Need For Justice&quot; by Lucy Sichone which appeared on January 29, 1996 and &quot;Miyanda Missed Point Over Writer's Article&quot; by Bright Mwape which appeared on February 1, 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice-President Miyanda complained that the articles would, in the long run, intimidate members of parliament and make them afraid to debate in the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To avoid a situation of the Arab and the camel where slowly this house will be brought into ridicule, is it in order for this paper and the three authors to present the matter in the way they did, particularly that they were not accurate and they were one sided?&quot; Miyanda asked the Speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before making the ruling, Nabulyato outlined the powers and privileges enjoyed by members of parliament and described what contempt is and what constitutes breach of parliamentary privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that it was clear from the provision of the National Assembly ( Powers and Privileges ) Act Cap 17 of the laws of Zambia, especially section 3, 23 and 25 that the authors of the three articles not only committed a breach of parliamentary privileges but also committed an offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The articles were manifestly contemptuous of not only his honour the Vice- President, the Speaker and the honourable deputy minister of energy, but also libellous against their person and the house,&quot; Nabulyato ruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He singled out M'membe for stating that &quot;our peoples parliament is an imitation, including the Speakers robe and the constitution of Zambia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These remarks were highly injurious to the house. They were deliberately calculated insults against members of parliament and meant to put the house into odium, contempt and ridicule,&quot; Nabulyato said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nabulyato added that as Speaker, he had the duty to protect the house and its members &quot;from wanton and calculated attacks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Having found a prima facie case against the three, I am refering the cases to the standing orders committee for their further consideration,&quot; Nabulyato said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The offence carries a fine not exceeding K1,000 or twelve months imprisonment with or without hard labour or both.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Starving baboons have taken over the affairs of Livingstone immigration and customs officials at the Victoria Falls border where they walk at will into the offices, grab anything they want and majestically walk out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Immigrations and Zambia Revenue Authority officials have said they are tired of informing the National Parks management about the baboons which have resorted to fighting back when one tries to stop them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Livingstone honorary wildlife scout, Benjamin Mibenge (not former UNIP secretary general), blamed officials of the two departments for having encroached on the baboons, territory around the Falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What would you do if someone invades you in your house?&quot; Mibenge asked in an interview on Saturday. &quot;People provoked them into behaving the way they are doing and no one will move them out from the area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But an immigration officer threatened to shoot the baboons if National Parks failed to find a solution to the new border problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Post visit at the border disclosed that huge male baboons were more interested in harassing women cross-border traders with food items while leaving the male traders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The baboons have literally pumped fear into foreign tourists whom they harass, snatch cameras and handbags from while armed police officers look on helplessly as they can't shoot them without the authority of National Parks.  This has forced members of the Livingstone Tourism Association to ask for government protection for foreign tourists from both Zambian petty thieves and baboons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - National soccer team skipper Kalusha Bwalya has ventured into the export market and has ganged up with five others to set up a company that will act as agents in exporting Zambian players to overseas leagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His local partner in Zambezi Sports Promotions, Andre Mtine confirmed that the company was formed in December last year in England and would soon start exporting Zambian players to pursue professional soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We registered the company in December last year and though we were supposed to have started exporting players by now we decided to wait because the season in Europe is coming to an end, but we will start as soon as possible&quot; confirmed Mtine in a telephone interview from his Ndola base yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mtine, whose father Tom once served as Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) chairman, named the other partners in the company as two Zambians based in England, Joe Kasolo and his brother , and a British lawyer Howard Datin, whose services the firm is using for approval from FIFA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't need a licence as such because we have a solicitor and according to the latest FIFA rules, you don't need to pay any money once you have a solicitor. We are acting legally and I only hope things will be fine as we go on,&quot; said Mtine, disclosing that John Fashanu was also consultant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He is going to be helping us where we need help as he is a consultant.  We want to get as many players as possible in the European leagues,&quot;said Mtine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new FIFA circular number 571, dated December 4, 1995, regulating players' agents, states a solictator does not need to pay any money . In the past, agents were required to pay $200,000 to get FIFA a licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the markets Zambezi Sports Promotions has gone to are Holland, England, France, Saudi Arabia and Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Mtine, chairman of Ndola Wanderers, a northern zone first division side, has hinted that he may not contest the coming FAZ elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I may contest if they will allow me to remain an official at Ndola Wanderers ,&quot; said Mtine.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Chiluba is using state security information for political blackmail of government leaders threatening to abandon him, a former minister has claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) secretary general and former deputy minister in the Office of the President, Derrick Chitala, charged in Lusaka yesterday that it was shameful to have a President who only sees 'evil' when a person differs with him fundamentally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a shame that whoever differs with President Chiluba, he takes it personally and either attacks them through their business or cooks up charges against them,&quot; Chitala said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chitala was reacting to the questioning by police of former commerce, trade and industry minister Dipak Patel, who resigned from government last Friday, on charges of illegal dealing in scrap metals, which charges have now been backdated to December 1987.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) secretary Bishop John Mambo said the position of his organisation on the Constitution had not changed and expressed worry at the action of the state against the former commerce minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are concerned with what is happening,&quot; Mambo said. &quot;If a citizen asks, we will approach the government and assist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police recorded a warn and caution statement from Patel on Monday on metal dealings of a company, Alloy Metal Products Limited, on whose board he once sat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both his brother, Shirish, and senior investigations officers involved in the matter have since disputed the professional wisdom of raising the matter against Patel when police investigations failed to establish anything and the case was closed last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police last year made a futile search of Alloy Metal Products in a bid to find something against Patel's brother Shirish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Chitala charged that the matter has been raised in Chiluba's 'typical' &quot;let me fix him&quot; style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a sick way of conducting politics. The same thing has happened to other leaders that have resigned like Chuulu Kalima. A lot of those remaining now cannot leave because Chiluba has blackmailed them. They don't know what he may release on them. But they should be able to if they are clean enough, it is just that they are spineless. Its dirty,&quot; Chitala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Cabinet source said in Lusaka yesterday that Patel's resignation was the climax of two weeks of tension over the Constitution and described the charges on Patel as a case of &quot;sour grapes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The height of the issue was the Monday The Post published the banned story on the referendum. Cabinet and MMD's national executive committee members were scheduled to discuss the matter the same day but were shocked by the story in The Post that morning. The President was extremely disturbed about it but the mistake was that he allowed the meeting to proceed,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the meeting Patel expressed reservations about the political approach to adopting the Constitution. He felt the people were supreme and should adopt all controversial issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When queried in Lusaka on Tuesday Patel maintained that whatever else was being clouded on his resignation would not take away the fact that he is principally opposed to the President's approach on the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would rather have the people say they want a Zambian born of black parents or whatever to lead them at whatever level, than a cabinet or parliament of a few MMD men passing that in the Constitution. On principle, I can not accept that,&quot; Patel said. &quot;There are issues government can mess up, but for goodness sake not a Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When pressed to discuss the major differences between him and Chiluba Patel declined saying he for now wants to hold his pledge not to be confrontational with the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Zambia Civic Education Association lawyer, Christine Kunda, said it was a strange coincidence that the state has found a case on Patel at the same time as his resignation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Geneva - Scientists working on specimens from nine of the youths hospitalized in Makokou, the provincial capital of Ogooue-Ivindo in Gabon, have confirmed the initial diagnosis of the Ebola haemorrhagic fever by isolation of the Ebola virus. This was done at the Centre International de Recherches M&eacute;dicales de Franceville in Gabon and at the WHO Collaborating Centre in the Institute Pasteur in Paris. Both the Ministry of Health of Gabon and WHO have been officially informed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As of today, there are 20 cases and 7 suspect cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Gabon. Thirteen of the cases have died.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All 20 cases come from Mayibout II, an isolated village with some 150 inhabitants which is situated some 400 kilometers east of the capital city, Libreville. Twelve of the dead have been confirmed to have had direct contact with the blood of a dead chimpanzee. The thirteenth, most recent death was a six-month old child of one of the original 19 cases. Another child of the same parent has developed fever and has been hospitalized in Makokou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of those 19 cases originally admitted in the Makokou provincial hospital on 5 and 6 February with symptoms of high fever, bloody diarrhoea and severely reddened eyes, 9 patients have died in the hospital and 3 back in their home village of Mayibout II. The average age of the patients was 18 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No cases of Ebola among the health personnel of the hospital have been registered, though some may have been exposed to the virus and could be infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international team of medical experts with members from the Gabonese Ministry of Health, La Cooperation Francaise (the French Bilateral Aid Agency), the Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville (Gabon), the Institute Pasteur (Paris) and the World Health Organization (WHO) arrived in Mayibout II on Friday night, 16 February, after a nine-hour river trip by motorized pirogues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team is investigating all possible contacts of the patients, as well as rumours of illness in two neighboring villages: Mayibout I and Mvadi, a village of 800 inhabitants 10 kilometers from Mayibout II. Persons who accompanied the patients to the hospital in Makokou and who returned with the dead bodies to bury them are known to live in these two villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Mayibout II, the international team has identified, isolated and put under close surveillance 6 persons with symptoms which could be early Ebola infection. A small field laboratory is being established in the village to test blood specimens from the local population suspected to have the infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Mayibout bush, a number of dead animals have been found: one chimpanzee, one wild cat, one antelope and two gorillas. A team of the Gabonese government is ensuring surveillance of the animal life in the affected area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Makokou, part of the international team is searching for 10 additional persons who accompanied patients from Mayibout II to the provincial hospital. This team is also searching for any persons with symptoms which could be early Ebola infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the request of the Gabonese government, La Cooperation Fran&ccedil;aise has sent to Gabon the necessary protection material, transport means and drugs. The logistics system of the French military in Gabon was also put as the disposal of the Gabonese Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For the time being, WHO does not recommend any travel restrictions to or within Gabon. If proper isolation of all persons with suspected early Ebola infection is ensured, there is no need for quarantine measures. The early action taken by the Gabonese Ministry of Health was prompt and effective. With the precautions taken, and investigation of the outbreak and sensitization campaigns of the population in the affected area under way, it is hoped that the spread of the epidemic will be minimized&quot;, concludes WHO's Division in Geneva dealing with new and reemerging diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak in Gabon is the second recent outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Africa. In May 1995, the disease struck in Zaire infecting 316 and killing 245 people, a 77% case-fatality rate. There was also one single case of Ebola in Cote d'Ivoire last December. The patient survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with blood secretions or body fluids from infected person. The symptoms of the disease include the sudden onset of fever, followed by vomiting, diarrhoea and massive bleeding.  The incubation period is between 2 and 21 days. No specific treatment or vaccine against the Ebola haemorrhagic fever exist.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Text of statement by American Committee on Africa calling for action In support on a total ban on landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Numerous human rights groups are working together to promote a comprehensive ban by the United States on the use, production, stockpiling and export of antipersonnel landmines. An estimated 100 million landmines have been laid in more than 60 countries. About one third of these landmines are in Africa. These landmines kill or injure 26,000 people each year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called on the international community to unequivocally condemn landmines which he noted are &quot;excessively cruel, cause horrific injuries, and - even after the cessation of hostilities - target unarmed civilians indiscriminately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LEAHY-EVANS AMENDMENT: In January 1996 President Clinton signed legislation, introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy and Representative Lane Evans, which imposes a one year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines by U.S. forces except along international boundaries and demilitarized zones. This provision takes effect in 1999. The bill also extends the current moratorium on U.S. landmine exports for one year, through 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> INTERNATIONAL: In his address to the United Nations on September 1994, President Clinton called for the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines. However, since that time the U.S. has not taken any steps to secure agreement on such a ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Internationally, 22 countries, including most recently Canada, have banned the use, production and export of antipersonnel landmines. However, the U.S. has not adopted these measures, and has not argued for a comprehensive ban in the negotiation on the Convention on Conventional Weapons. The concluding session for these negotiations is scheduled for April 22 through May 3. These negotiations are the logical place for the U.S. to push for the elimination on antipersonnel landmines. The Clinton administration, while favoring some restrictions, has not pushed for an outright ban on antipersonnel landmines. Rather, the U.S. has proposed that antipersonnel landmines should be made to &quot;self-destruct&quot; after a period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LANDMINE CLEARANCE: In Angola alone there are an estimated 9-15 million landmines. Other countries where there is a significant landmine threat include Mozambique and Somalia. However, even some countries that have been at peace for many years, including Namibia and Zimbabwe, have areas where landmines still need to be cleared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACTION NEEDED: Write President Clinton and your congressional delegation and urge that the U.S. join other countries and adopt a comprehensive ban on antipersonnel landmines. Further, in the re-negotiation of the Convention on Conventional Weapons the U.S. should strongly support a comprehensive ban on landmines including use, production, stockpiling and export.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is writing to condemn the attempted murder of Alex Ibru, publisher of the Guardian Group and a former Internal Affairs Minister in your government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ibru was shot at point blank range in his car as he traveled from his Lagos office late on Friday, February 2, 1996. Ibru received several injuries including bullet wounds to the left side of his head and to his leg. On Sunday, February 4, 1996 after initial treatment at a Lagos hospital, Ibru was flown to a London hospital for treatment and underwent a six-and-a-half hour operation. Police have called the attempted murder of Ibru a foiled armed robbery and arrested nine men in connection with the heinous crime.  However, we note with concern that nothing was stolen from Ibru's car or from his person.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are deeply alarmed at the increasing incidence of assaults, intimidation and repression directed against the independent media. &quot;The Guardian&quot; was allowed to resume publication in July 1995 after your government lifted a year-long ban on it. In December 1995, an arson attack on &quot;The Guardian&quot;'s editorial office gutted a section of the building. We wrote to Your Excellency previously on several occasions urging you to lift the ban on &quot;The Guardian&quot; and condemning the arson attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We now urge Your Excellency to initiate a thorough investigation of this crime to bring the culprits to justice. Furthermore, we call on you to ensure the freedom and protection of journalists in your country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Letter to His Excellency Jerry John Rawlings, president of the Republic of Ghana, from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director, Committee to Protect Journalists, February 15, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) protests in the strongest terms the detention of Nana Kofi Coomson, editor in chief of the &quot;Ghanaian Chronicle,&quot; Ebeneezer Quarcoo, editor of the &quot;Free Press,&quot; and Tommy Thompson, publisher of the &quot;Free Press,&quot; who were remanded into custody on February 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On February 9, police arrested and questioned Coomson, and later released him on bail of 10 million cedis (US$6,700). Quarcoo and Thompson were away from their offices when they were summoned to police headquarters for questioning the same day. They reported to police headquarters February 12 and were also released on bail of 10 million cedis each after interrogation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On February 14, Circuit Court Judge Nuhu Bila revoked the bail_without explanation_and the three were immediately remanded into custody until February 22, when their case will be heard. Counsel for the three journalists has filed an appeal with the High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coomson, Quarcoo and Thompson were charged with &quot;publishing false news with the intent of injuring the reputation of the State,&quot; a violation of Section 185 of the Criminal Code of 1960, an ordinance of the colonial era.  If convicted, they could face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;Free Press&quot; and the &quot;Ghanaian Chronicle&quot; reprinted in their January 31 and February 1 editions, respectively, a story published in the New York-based bi-weekly &quot;The African Observer&quot; reporting that Ghanaian diplomat Frank Benneh, of the Ghanaian Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva, had been arrested in Switzerland for selling drugs. The article also alleged that Your Excellency's government has used proceeds from illegal drug sales to buy arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a non-partisan group of journalists dedicated to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ contends that Kofi Coomson, Eben Quarcoo and Tommy Thompson have been jailed for exercising their right to practice their profession. We also believe that Section 185, under which those journalists have been charged, contravenes the right to free expression, guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights; the 1991 Windhoek Declaration on Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press, all to which, we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Ghana is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ urges Your Excellency to ensure the immediate and unconditional release of Coomson, Quarcoo and Thompson. Furthermore, we urge Your Excellency to revoke Section 185 of Criminal Code as an assurance that the independent press in Ghana may work freely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - The World Bank is supporting the initiative to establish the African Poverty Reduction Network. The Vice President of the Africa Region, Mr. Edward V.K. Jaycox, said today he strongly supported the work of the Network, created in Oslo, Norway in January 1995, with assistance from the Norwegian, Dutch, Japanese and Canadian governments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Network group was initially brought together by the Africa Region of the Bank to obtain an African input into the preparation of the report of a task force on Taking Action or Poverty Reduction in Africa. It is made up of distinguished Africans from government, non-governmental organization, academia and the private sector. Network members are expected to bring a new perspective to the search for ways of effectively reducing poverty in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second meeting of the Network was held in Washington D.C. in December last year to review the Bank s analysis of actions required to reduce poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa, and to define the scope of its work. It was agreed that the Network would:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * serve as an advocacy group with governments, donors, an civil society to draw attention to the urgency of the need to effectively reduce poverty;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * promote the participation of the poor and relevant grassroots organizations and other stockholders in programs and discussions aimed at poverty reduction;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * act as a think-tank to identify and find solutions to the challenges of poverty reduction, and develop prototype activities;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * review analytical work and strengthen the system of poverty monitoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is anticipated that a number of donors will support this initiative intended to harness African intellectual input into the poverty reduction endeavor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interim Vice Chairwoman of the Network, Ms. Pauline Biyong of Cameroon, will be in Washington soon to initiate arrangements for the establishment of a small Network Secretariat.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - Finance Ministers from Burkina Faso, Gabon, Kenya and Uganda met today with the President of the World Bank, Mr. James D.  Wolfensohn. Led by Mr. Doupamby-Matoka of Gabon, the Ministers had been delegated by their counterparts across Africa to discuss an action program for building Africa s human and institutional capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capacity refers to trained and experienced personnel in both the pubic and private sectors, as well as to the institutions in which they work. A lack of skilled professionals, coupled with poor design and management of institutions is widely recognized as a key barrier to economic growth in Africa. The Ministers agreed that &quot;Capacity . . . allows people to achieve the objectives they set for themselves.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lacking human and institutional capacity, countries must rely on foreign expertise and resources to perform the elemental tasks of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recognizing that past attempts to solve these problems have met with little success, the African Finance Ministers broached the subject with Mr.  Wolfensohn at the World Bank s Annual Meeting last October, and he asked his staff to work together with the Ministers to develop proposals for effective action to build Africa s capacity. In collaboration with the Bank s African Executive Directors, and after extensive consultations with African authorities and experts on capacity building, government officials, business people, academicians, non-governmental organizations and others, the group agreed on a set of principals:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, the focus of capacity building efforts must be the national level. Donors can no longer simply devise solutions on their behalf; Africans must feel they own the process and must grasp the initiative in building capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, donors must incorporate the principle of Africa ownership within their programs for capacity building. They should approach technical assistance issues so as to increase local participation in planning and implementing development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Third, a strategic approach needs to be devised that addresses the chronic problems that underlie the capacity problem in Africa, such as building strategic human skills, transforming government, strengthening the private sector, and enhancing the self-sufficiency of local communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President agreed with an action program proposed by the Ministers.  This includes a set of sub-regional meetings in Africa to build consensus on capacity building goals and approaches. National-level capacity assessments, which will serve as the basis for planning coordinated strategies, will be carried out in a sampling of African countries by local consultants. In addition, a team composed of African experts and World Bank staff will study the impact of the Bank s operational practices on capacity in Africa, and it will identify best practices for capacity building from around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Based on the results of these meetings and assessments, the African Ministers will meet again with Mr. Wolfensohn to discuss a detailed plan of action. The Finance Ministers and Mr. Wolfensohn also discussed possible improvements in areas of critical importance to building Africa s capacity, including education and information technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They agreed on the need for increased utilization of local African professionals, ad for addressing political and administrative obstacles to the smooth functioning of institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Letter dated February 6, 1996, to His Excellency Frederick Chiluba, President of Republic of Zambia, from William A. Orme, Jr., Executive Director, Committee to Protect Journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellency,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to condemn in the strongest terms the arrests of Fred M'membe, Masautso Phiri and Bright Mwape of &quot;The Post,&quot; as well as the banning of the February 5 edition of the independent daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Managing director M'membe, editor-in-chief Phiri, and managing editor Mwape were arrested in the early morning hours of February 6, after 18 armed and plainclothes police officers conducted a search of the editorial offices of &quot;The Post.&quot; These searches violated a law requiring that searches only be conducted during daylight hours.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police searched computer files and documents in the office for material relating to a February 5 article about a secret government plan to promulgate a controversial draft constitution in March. &quot;The Post's February 5 edition was banned by presidential decree and declared a &quot;prohibited publication&quot; under Section 53 of the Penal Code. The decree warned the public that anyone found with a copy of the edition would be committing a criminal offense under the Prohibited Publications Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe, Phiri and Mwape were charged with two counts of receiving information that is knowingly in contravention of the State Security Act and unlawful possession of a prohibited publication, namely the February 5 edition of &quot;The Post.&quot; They now remain in the Woodlands Police Station, where they await a magistrate to hear their request for release on bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ has documented with alarm the countless attacks against &quot;The Post&quot; since its founding in 1991. As a non-partisan group of journalists committed to the protection of our colleagues' rights worldwide, we are deeply troubled by this pattern of harassment. We believe that Section 53 has no place in a democratic society because it undermines the right to free expression, guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights; and the 1991 Windhoek Declaration on Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press, all to which, we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Zambia is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We strongly urge Your Excellency to drop the charges against the three editors, and to release them immediately and unconditionally. We also call on Your Excellency to ensure that attacks against the independent press cease, and that M'membe, CPJ's 1995 International Press Freedom Award winner, and all his colleagues can work freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (The editors have since been granted bail and released.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For further information, please contact Kakuna Kerina (x 103), Program Coordinator for Africa, or Azeen Salimi, Research Associate (x 118) at CPJ, 330 Seventh Ave, New York NY 10001, U.S.A., tel:+1 212 465 1004, fax:+1 212 465 9568, e-mail: africa@cpj.org,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria - Text of a Statement: Regionalising the RDP - Creating a Common Economic Community for the Construction and Allied Industries in Southern Africa, 12 February 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Southern Africa Construction Industry Initiative is being held at Eskom Megawatt Park and the Development Bank of Southern Africa this week to consider and ratify protocols of co-operation between ten countries in the southern Africa sub-region and to investigate the main constraints which have hampered the development of the viable national construction capacity in each of the participating countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The goal is to formulate policy options which will encourage and advance local participation in the industry. This will improve the sector's performance and contribution to the economic development in each country and ultimately the region as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hosted by the Department of Public Works (PWD) and the Council of Construction in South Africa (COCOSA) the conference is attended by 150 delegates including ministers, senior officials and private sector representatives from Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique, Malawi, Swaziland and Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a paper delivered at the conference, Deputy Director General of the Public Works Department, Sivi Gounden, proposed that the principles of the South African Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) be extended to include the neighbouring states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In other words,&quot; he said, &quot;the construction industries of the African states would develop a set of operating and business practices to ensure that in the provision of construction goods, they also realise the more qualitative developmental objectives of the RDP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These would then open the construction markets, level the playing fields for construction companies in different countries, standardise the procedures under which development projects will be funded, facilitate the movement of construction firms and personnel and contribute towards creating a more equitable process of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RDP is not merely about the provision of houses, services and facilities, it requires the qualitative transformation of the industry so that certain basic objectives such as providing jobs, housing, telecommunications and transport, developing human resources and building the economy can be met. However, the main benefit of the RDP will come from the active participation of all sectors of the South African economy. Public sector funding is essential to kickstart the development process and to create the operating framework for construction work more generally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The public sector has the leverage to introduce and promote new productions and business practices in the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PWD in conjunction with the departments of Trade and Industry, Labour, Education, Housing, State Expenditure, Transport, Water Affairs and the RDP Office, has launched an initiative to ensure that the objectives of the RDP and related initiatives by government are realised in the construction and allied industries. These interventions will comprehensively transform the construction economy in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cautioned that whilst the RDP will have a positive impact on South Africa, the economies of neighbouring states could suffer as a result. In the past, imbalances in the regional economy often meant that development for South Africa gave rise to the under-development of her regional partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inequalities such as the skewed distribution of wealth and the resources to general wealth in the regional economies give rise to poverty, unemployment, social and physical debilitation, which eventually impact on South Africa. As a result of the increase in construction supply required by the RDP neighbouring countries might find their construction sectors depleted of appropriate skills as technical supervisory and managerial staff turn to South Africa for more attractive opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Apart from being callous, such practices can only harm the South African economy in the long run,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Jeff Radebe, Minister of Public Works said that in the interests of all regional partners, extending the practices and benefits of the RDP beyond the borders of South Africa will bring about reconstruction and development for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;During the past two years, we have been working in close co- operation with COCOSA. It is important that neighbouring governments maintain regular contact with one representative industry umbrella body such as COCOSA. This will encourage problem solving and mutual understanding,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister Harlem Brundtland;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the Diplomatic Corps;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Distinguished Guests;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and gentlemen,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our countries could scarcely be situated further apart, lying at almost opposite ends of the globe. Geography and history have bequeathed us only limited economic relations. But the bond between us could not be closer or warmer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is therefore a special pleasure, now that we have achieved our freedom, to welcome you, Mme Brundtland, as the leader of a nation that elected to stand with us and make our cause their own, at a time when it was neither fashionable nor easy to do so. Indeed, we do know that this was not without cost. For that we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Your support for sanctions, and your humanitarian and development aid have been of immense benefit in providing support and succour; in making educational opportunities possible; and in contributing to victory in struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Above all we thank the Norwegian people for respecting the judgment of the oppressed in South Africa as to what kinds of struggle could achieve their liberation. This is the mark of a country which has had to struggle for its own independence and for the preservation of its own freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even after the advent of democracy, that respect for our judgment informs Norway's generous development assistance, In your support for our programmes for uplifting the quality of life of all our people, and for strengthening democracy and peace, you have again made our goals and priorities your own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The quality of your caring was eloquent in your visit yesterday to Robben Island, and your gift to help ensure that the Island remains a living symbol of freedom, peace and reconciliation. It is consistent with the Norwegian people's recognition, through the Nobel Prize, of the contribution which the people of South Africa have made to world peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For us your visit is therefore an opportunity both to celebrate, and to re-affirm, the partnership between our countries, and to ensure that the bonds forged in struggle flourish in freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The development of all round relations will be furthered by the agreements which we signed this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We attach great importance to the development of economic relations between our countries, as a sound and lasting contribution to economic growth in South Africa. We appreciate in particular the fact that our exports to your country have been facilitated by Norway's extension to us of the Generalised System of Preferences. We are confident that this visit will allow your delegation and South African business to identify opportunities for further trade and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa is immensely proud of the achievements of its sports-people and grateful for the contribution they are making to uniting our nation. But sport also has the capacity to draw nations closer together. We are therefore pleased to see amongst your delegation the president of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports, and look forward to co-operation between our countries in sport and physical recreation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister; your own determination and courage in fighting for the rights of women and children is widely admired. Norway is in the world's vanguard in matters of gender equality and serves as an inspiring example.  Our own government is committed to implementing the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, both of which it ratified last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are committed too to joining with Norway in working for peace and stability, for development, prosperity and human rights everywhere. We therefore appreciate in particular the steps to co-operate in the fields of peace-keeping in Southern Africa and nuclear non-proliferation. We welcome the presence in your delegation of Foreign Minister Godal - this will help to cement bilateral relations and to take our co-operation in international affairs to a still higher level of partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and gentlemen;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allow me to propose a toast to His Majesty King Harald V and the people of Norway, and to the flourishing of friendship between our peoples. SKOL</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The government will soon adopt a new tourism policy for Zambia, parliament heard yesterday. Tourism minister, Gabriel Maka, told parliament that the final report on a new policy and attendant medium-term national tourism strategies and plans of action has been received and will soon be recommended to cabinet for approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maka was responding to various contributions by members of parliament on the estimates of expenditure (including capital, constitutional and statutory expenditure) on the committee of supply for the tourism ministry. &quot;As a result of the introduction of this new policy and strategy, new legislation is being developed which will harmonise and facilitate its implementation,&quot; Maka said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the problems and impediments being experienced in the development of tourism in Zambia are a consequence of inadequate systems and structures and these will be addressed in the new policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Maka also told parliament that the government intends to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Service Act of 1991 to introduce new wildlife legislation and strengthen enforcement provisions against wildlife crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the new legislation will provide a new autonomous structure for the efficient management of the wildlife eco-system and foster the economic and social well-being of the local communities in game management areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was responding to a complaint by Mfuwe MMD member of parliament Paul Lumbi who said that game management areas were not benefiting the local communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, the Ministry of Tourism will in the near future start operating a steam safari on the Mulobezi railway line, parliament heard yesterday. &quot;This follows the successful rehabilitation and delivery from Zimbabwe of the first class deluxe coach in December last year,&quot; Maka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was responding to Lukulu West MMD member of parliament Simon Ngombo who wanted to know what measures the government had taken to diversify tourism. Maka also said Zambia has made a commitment to the United Nations to sign the Agreement on wildlife crime after meeting other UN members on the matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda and four other prominent African leaders spent last week touring Britain and Ireland addressing meetings on the debt crisis in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda, with Archbishop Khotso Makhulu, former SADCC chief executive Simba Makoni, former African Development Bank chief Prof Adebayo Adedeji and Prof Bade Onimode visited Manchester, Leeds, Leicester, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow and London &quot;where large numbers of people came to hear them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They were invited to Britain by the Debt Crisis Network, to alert European political opinion to the scale of the excruciating burden of external debt imposed on the people of Africa who are 'the poorest of the poor' of the world,&quot; a DCN press release says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to DCN, the distinguished African leaders &quot;met British and Irish ministers, representatives of the International Monetary Fund, including Michael Camdessus, the World Bank, the British Treasury and British businessmen with interests in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also released a signed press statement yesterday describing the purpose of their visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The aim of our visit has been to impress on British and European public opinion, the urgent necessity for debt cancellation for the most severely indebted least developed countries, if the appalling conditions of the African people are ever to be ameliorated,&quot; the statement reads in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda, who spoke at the &quot;Africa Needs a Fresh Start&quot; conference at Westminster on February 10 also travelled to Austria where &quot;he met both the Austrian chancellor and the President and called for urgent debt cancellation for countries of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former Zambian president also gave a Bruno Kreisky lecture on February 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DCN, which has a strong Christian involvement, embraces more than 40 organi- sations dedicated to &quot;achieving drastic reductions in Third World debt&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DCN which has produced its own report on debt in sub Saharan Africa, includes several churches and related organisations such as Christian Aid, Council of Churches for Wales, United Reformed Church, Church Missionary Society, Baptist Union, Colombian Fathers and Methodist Division of Social Responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other organisations include Action Aid, Abantu for Development, Debt and Development Coalition Ireland, Oxfam, World Action and World Development Movement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Nikuv contract for the updating of the voters' register is &quot;invalid and unconstitutional and opens the electoral process to external manipulation and potential rigging&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are among the claims contained in the affidavits filed in the High Court of Zambia by opposition UNIP and the Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) on February 7, this year in their suit against the Attorney General and the Vice-President of the Republic of Zambia over the Nikuv Computers (Israel) Limited contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have been advised by my advocates and I verily believe that the said contract is invalid as being contrary to the Constitution of Zambia and the Electoral Act,&quot; UNIP secretary-general Sebastian Zulu said, citing article 77(9) of the Zambian Constitution and section 14 of the 1991 Electoral Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP and LPF are arguing that Nikuv is not entitled by law to conduct the actual registration of voters in Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two political parties allege that the Electoral Commission has abdicated its duties of registering and conducting elections and want the court to declare the government action as both illegal and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The exercise by the third respondent (Nikuv) of the statutory functions exercisable only by the Electoral Commission be declared null and void,&quot; UNIP and LPF have demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another affidavit sworn by Zulu, the two parties claim that the decision to have voters cards made in Israel was suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By reason therefore I verily believe that the process of the voters registration and election could be subject to manipulation and rigging on an unprecedented scale,&quot; Zulu claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zulu claimed both the Vice-President and the Electoral Commission admitted to this fact at a meeting they had at Cabinet Office on November 16, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At this meeting Vice-President Miyanda questioned the ability of Nikuv to distribute voters cards long after registering voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zulu argues that like Vice-President Miyanda correctly observed, the Nikuv contract would disenfranchise a lot of Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By the matters aforesaid I verily believe that the contract signed will disenfranchise a lot of people who would be unable to collect their voters cards form whatever centres after the third respondent (Nikuv) brought them in the country from Israel where they would be printed,&quot; claimed Zulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP and LPF are also worried by the absence of a mechanism to issue duplicate cards to those who would be registered but lose their cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the affidavits the parties are uncomfortable about clause 30 of the Nikuv contract which says Nikuv will be independent and will neither consider itself an employee or agent of the Zambian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By reason thereof I believe that the third respondent(Nikuv) would not be accountable not only to the Electoral Commission but also to the voters as a whole,&quot; Zulu says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The suit is also challenging the classification by the government of the Nikuv contract as a &quot;secret&quot; when it was awarded by public tender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A further order that the current registration of voters being conducted in Zambia under the direction and supervision of the third respondent (Nikuv) be halted forthwith and that the said registration exercise be declared null and void as being contrary to the laws of Zambia,&quot; Zulu prayed to the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zulu said he only learned of the award of the tender to Nikuv in the press and through an advertisement on September 22, last year by Ted Mulonga, an MMD cadre now director of the tender board, and claims he was &quot;not aware whether the government had signed a contract&quot; with Nikuv and on what terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the time the director of the tender board made his statement defending the board's decision to award the contract to Nikuv, I was still not aware of the terms of the contract until January 31, 1996 when I had first sight of the said contract,&quot; Zulu says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parties believe the terms of this public contract should have been made public. The contract has been filed along with the affidavit in the High Court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - The World Bank's Africa Region will be headed by two new Vice Presidents, Mr. Callisto Madavo and Mr. Jean-Louis Sarbib.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They replace the departing Vice President, Mr. Edward V.K. Jaycox, who will retire on March 31 following a 31-year career with the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Announcing the appointments, World Bank President, Mr. James D.  Wolfensohn, said that the two were selected on th e basis of their demonstrated strengths as managers who have shown initiative and leadership, a concern for delivering services which meet client needs, an ability to engage their staff in developing a shared vision, and a strong sense for teamwork . He explained that the purpose of naming two Vice Presidents was to maintain close contact with African countries, while preserving an Africa-wide perspective on issues that cross country boundaries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A single office will support the two vice presidents. Madavo and Sarbib said that the major guiding principle is to maintain one Region, one vice presidential office, and one management team. They emphasized teamwork, supported by a single structure of support and advisory functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madavo and Sarbib said that while the Africa Region will remain unitary, it is important for people outside the Bank and the Region (clients and partners) to have a clear picture of who their primary contact is at the vice presidential level. Country responsibilities will reflect geographic contiguity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Madavo will have primary responsibility for Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Sarbib will be responsible for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo , Cote d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two Vice Presidents will also divide responsibility for the Africa-wide initiatives and fora where the Bank plays an important institutional role. Mr. Sarbib will take primary responsibility for the Capacity Building Initiative launched last October, the Global Coalition for Africa, and the Special Program for African Agricultural Research (SPAAR).  Mr. Madavo will be responsible for the Special Program for Africa (SPA), the UN Initiative for Africa, and contact with African institutions (UN Economic Commission for Africa, African Development Bank, Organization for African Unity, etc.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Madavo, a Zimbabwean national, is currently Country Director in the East Asia &amp; Pacific Region of the World Bank. Joining the Bank as an economist in 1969, he has served in senior positions in the Transport and Urban Projects Department, the South Asia Country Programs Department, and within the Africa Region prior to assignment to his current position in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Sarbib, a French national, is currently Director for the Western Africa Department of the Africa Region of the World Bank. He joined the Bank in January 1980 as a Planning Advisory Officer, and held senior positions relating to Eastern, Central and Southern Africa prior his appointment as Division Chief for Country Operations in the Sahelian Department in 1990. He was appointed to his current position in 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - High Court Judge David Lewanika yesterday adjourned the ruling in the case relating to the continued bail for the three Post editors who are charged with receiving classified information under the State Secrets Act to this Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a hearing yesterday to review the bail for Post editor-in-chief and managing director Fred M'membe, managing editor Bright Mwape and editor special projects Masautso Phiri, defence counsels for the trio raised a preliminary issue &quot;as to whether or not the court had jurisdiction to review its own decision in a criminal matter&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The defence counsels argued that Order 39 rule 1 upon which the state was relying to make its application only applied to review of civil, and not criminal, charges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They went on to argue that even if Order 39 rule 1 applied to criminal matters the court could not review its decision as no new matters were brought up which were not raised and argued in the court below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was further argued that all the matters raised in the affidavit filed by the state did not warrant the reopening of the case. The defence went on to argue that there must be some finality to judgments and it did not matter if the state would not be able to appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state conceded that the Criminal Procedure Code did not provide for the review of criminal matters but they argued that the same code did not also prohibit the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State Advocates William Lewis and Linus Eyotia Eyaa argued that there was a need for the state to show that the decision by the Director of Public Prosecution to issue a certificate under Section 123 (4) of the Criminal Procedure Code certifying that it was likely that the interests of the Republic of Zambia would be prejudiced by the three editors being granted bail was not malafide but bonafide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court has set Friday, February 16 for ruling on the preliminary issue raised.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Finance minister Ronald Penza yesterday welcomed the launching of the Zambia Venture Capital Fund and described it as a necessary link to foster development of private investment in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview after the launch of the fund by President Chiluba, Penza assured the private sector of government's support.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We welcome the fund as it is a necessary link to enhance investment development in the private sector,&quot; Penza said. &quot;We now have an instrument which will go a long way in the private sector development and I would encourage more Zambians to invest in the fund.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fund has been set up by Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), the European Investment Bank, the German Investment and Development Company and First Merchant Bank of Zambia with an initial cash injection of US$2.5 million intended for private sector financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CDC's London based chairman, Lord Cairns, revealed that the fund had already received 200 applications from business houses although it had not yet started operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There has been an overwhelming response from the local businesses as we have already received 200 applications even before starting operations,&quot; Lord Cairns said in an interview. &quot; We are likely to start operations by the end of March under the chairmanship of David Phiri but we still have to set up the board before this is possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And President Chiluba expressed happiness at the diverse investment in the country and the bringing in of capital by external investors to supplement govern-ment's limited resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What is most encouraging is that external investment is not restricted to one sector, there is a widespread investment embracing, agriculture, mining, tourism and now with the bold move of the venture capital fund, the financial sector,&quot; Chiluba said at the launch.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Parliament will today debate a private motion by ruling party members aimed at removing former president Kenneth Kaunda's immunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Titled &quot;Removal of legal immunity in respect of the former president&quot;, the motion quotes terms of article 43 (3) of the Republican Constitution but does not specify the criminal charge the former president will face after his immunity is removed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MMD members of parliament are said to be divided on the issue which some believe is a private agenda of a few and which others blame on the proposer of the motion, Mandevu MP Patrick Katyoka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But other political observers believe the motion, which will be supported by Dundumwezi MP Myers Maingaila, is intended to test public reaction to the government's move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, speculation was rife by late last night that the motion would be withdrawn either before debate or on the floor because several senior MMD members were not amused by Katyoka's move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are pressures within the MMD to have the motion withdrawn and there is a lot of lobbying,&quot; a senior member within the MMD said last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And reacting to the proposed motion Mongu Central MP Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika condemned the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is not in anybody's interest in Zambia and it is wrong and dangerous. It is wrong because it is unjust to withdraw the right of someone without any specific charge being levelled against him,&quot; Lewanika said in an interview last night. &quot;If the motion goes ahead it will be a disgrace to the MMD more than to anybody else. It will make a hero of Kaunda for nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have recorded an increase of 2,186 tonnes in the production of finished copper,&quot; disclosed ZCCM spokesman Francis Musonda in an interview on Monday, adding: &quot; We have in fact recorded an increase over our estimated production for the month of January.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rise in production has been attributed to the good performance of the oxygen plant at the Nkana Smelter which has eased the refinery process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rise comes barely a month after the company underwent a management shakeup, with chief executive Edward Shamutete opening an office on the Copperbelt to assume direct supervision of operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In making the changes last month, Shamutete said ZCCM's metal production had declined to an alarmingly low rate in the last two years and measures had to be taken to arrest the situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It's going to be hot in Atlanta during the Olympics, and steamy Durban was the perfect venue for South Africa's Olympic squad to get used to these conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week in Durban the National Olympic Committee of South Africa (Nocsa) staged an eight-day training camp for 115 athletes from 13 different sports codes as part of its preparations for the centennial Olympic Games which take place in Atlanta in July. It was the first time a multi-code sports team had assembled for a camp of this nature in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The camp was aimed at simulating the hot and humid conditions that will be encountered in Atlanta in July and as such the guardians of the weather managed to deliver the perfect climate to ensure a sticky time was had by all. The week prior to the camp had been cool and overcast but, sure enough, as the squad assembled the sun came out with a vengeance. By Thursday the humidity level was comparable to a real steamer in Georgia according to the Olympic team's attache, Ron Davis, from LaGrange, a town 100km south west of Atlanta, where the team will attend a pre-Olympic training camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objectives of the camp were threefold according to Nocsa president Sam Ramsamy. &quot;We wanted the athletes to be able to train in conditions as close as possible to those they will have to compete in during the Olympic Games and we felt that Durban at this time of the year would be the best place in South Africa to find those conditions. This training camp has also provided us with an opportunity of getting to know one another and building a team spirit which will be so important in Atlanta. We have also been able to monitor the level of fitness and health of the team and discuss the medical tests that have been done on the athletes since August with them and their team coaches,&quot; said Ramsamy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two important members of the camp were Davis and his colleague from Atlanta, Tommy Phillips, who will be the South African team envoy during the games. The envoy programme was first used by an Olympic organising committee for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and was also used at the last Olympics in Barcelona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The South African team will have a total of 15 people assigned to it through the envoy programme. There will be five staff members and 10 drivers.  Each person on the programme will have undergone two years of intensive training by the time the Games begin. Our task will really be to make it easy for the athletes, coaches and team management to concentrate on the real business of the games and not have to worry about fundamental things like getting to training and competition venues and other logistical problems, &quot; said Phillips. Both he and Davis were able to get to know the squad and spend time fine tuning their planning arrangements with the Nocsa management team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davis is the director of athletics at the LaGrange Sports Authority which administers the sports programme at LaGrange College where the South African team will acclimatise for two weeks before the Olympics. The college boasts an excellent range of facilities including two synthetic athletics tracks, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, plus a gym and indoor facilities for other sports. The nearby West Point Lake will cater for rowing and canoeing and an equestrian centre is just 23km away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of Davis's tasks in Durban was to talk to the team's nutritionists to determine the dietary requirements of South African athletes. Any athletes who want to carbo load on mealie pap needn't worry, however. One of the African athletes on the Olympic solidarity programme has already planted his own mealie field!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &gt;From a medical point of view the chief medical officer to the South African team in Atlanta, Dr Shorty Moolla, was very happy with the proceedings in Durban. &quot;We were very fortunate that the weather conditions turned out so well. Most of the athletes were uncomfortable with the climate and we had three track and field athletes who had to be treated for dehydration and one for heat stroke. Myself, Dr John Hawley, who is a sports scientist and nutritionist, and Dr Philda de Jager spent three days with each coach and athlete going through their scientific and medical test results. We homed in on nutrition and made recommendations about their diets and any supplements they should be taking,&quot; said Moolla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The athletes were all tested for steroids and many with injury or health problems were X-rayed and put on remedial treatment while at the camp. There were lectures in the early mornings and evenings covering nutrition, sports psychology, acclimatisation and other medical issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The camp was an absolute success and from our perspective what is important is that we can assess the level of fitness and mental state of the athletes and what effect their training is having on their bodies,&quot; said Moolla. There will be a further set of tests done in March and April on athletes who have been selected for the team but these will be more specific to the actual sports pursued by the individuals concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I must admit some of us were a bit sceptical beforehand but right from the word go everything has been done so professionally,&quot; said a member of the rowing team. &quot;The people were there to meet us as arranged at our stopover on our journey down here and when we arrived at the hotel everything had been attended to. With so many people involved I must take my hat off to Nocsa for the job they've done,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the rowers do their training at Roodeplaat Dam outside Pretoria where the altitude is a definite advantage, but even they were pleased with their stint at the Campsdrift Canoeing Club on the Dusi River in Pietermaritzburg. &quot;The training has been great because the change of environment and the whole team spirit associated with being part of the Olympic squad has really focused us,&quot; said John Callie, the stroke in the men's lightweight coxless fours boat from Vikings Rowing Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But besides the training there was also the social bonding between people from different sports codes who would not normally meet one another.  The restaurant and particularly the bar in the evenings saw many new friendships struck and the fostering of a camaraderie which could make that little extra difference when the chips are down in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final morning of the camp saw the athletes go behind closed doors for the announcement of the first batch of team members for Atlanta. There were no major surprises although the men's hockey team were clearly relieved after all the media speculation over whether or not they would be selected.  There were 43 confirmed team places although some, as with the two rowing crews, the hockey side and the women's swimming medley relay team, will only have names entered later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There will be many other opportunities for some of the other sports to qualify for the team, particularly athletics and swimming who will name their full contingents after their respective national championships in April and March.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The 12 contenders in the troubled sixth World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The average age of the Dutch squad is 32, and it is only that low because they have included an 18-year-old schoolboy, Bastiaan Zuiderent. Four of their players have substantial first-class experience. Nolan Clarke, aged 47, cracked 159 for Barbados against Mike Denness's tourists in 1974. His opening partner, Peter Cantrell, used to represent Queensland, while the sturdy medium-pacers Paul-Jan &quot;Nip&quot; Bakker and Roland Lefevbre are familiar on the English county circuit. Their batting could sparkle but they will struggle in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odds: 1 000-1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Zealand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN 1992, New Zealand were brilliant. But for Martin Crowe's torn hamstring and a ferocious last-ditch assault by Pakistan's Inzamam ul-Haq in Auckland, they would have stunned the pundits by reaching the final. No ploy was too outrageous for captain Crowe; off-spinner Patel opened the bowling, Greatbatch slogged from ball one and a gaggle of motley medium-pacers were used in mesmerising two-over spells.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patel, now 37, survives, but Crowe's knee has forced his retirement and Greatbatch is out of favour. The Canterbury wicket-keeper Lee Germon has taken on the captaincy after a tempestuous two years for New Zealand cricket and no matter how innovative he is, it is hard to envisage the inexperienced Kiwis reaching the semi-finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Cairns is their most potent cricketer. He is a more orthodox batsman than his father, Lance (not too difficult), a pacier bowler and an equally tenacious competitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odds: 33-1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Assuming he gets a game, Javed Miandad will become the only cricketer to play in all six World Cups. We have learned not to be easily surprised by the machinations of the Pakistan Cricket Board, but the recall of Miandad, now 38 years of age, is an astonishing move even by their standards. He has been out of the team for two years with a leg injury; his fitness is unproven. And do they really believe that Javed has become the peacemaker to unify a tempestuous dressing room?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the space of 15 months, Pakistan have had four captains: Wasim Akram (removed -- players' revolt); Salim (removed -- bribery scandal); Moin Khan (removed -- only a stopgap); and Ramiz Raja (removed -- lost to Sri Lanka) before reverting to Wasim. Of these, only Moin is missing from the World Cup squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Pakistan possess supremely talented cricketers, such as Sohail, Salim and Inzamam. Wasim Akram is a magnificent one-day bowler. Waqar Younis used to be; in the recent series in Australia, though, he was short of full pace and less devastating as a result, while wrist-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed had a fine winter touring Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But to retain the Cup they will have to improve their fielding significantly, cope with the mighty expectations of a feverish home crowd and ensure that all the ex-captains are four-square behind Wasim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odds: 7-2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After their comprehensive 6-1 defeat of England in the one-day series, the perceived weakness of the South African team -- a dearth of quality batting -- does not appear to carry much weight. They are supremely confident that someone will score enough runs to allow a powerful bowling attack to win the match. The development of Gary Kirsten as a rock-solid opener and the introduction of Jacques Kallis has been reassuring for coach Bob Woolmer, especially while Hansie Cronje, their most dangerous one-day batsman, has found runs hard to come by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So has the emergence of a potent spin attack that may be vital in the sub-continent. The fiercely competitive off-spinner Pat Symcox clawed his way back into the squad with gritty performances against England, while batsmen will want to have a good look at the freakish left-arm spinners of the nerveless Paul Adams before launching an assault. He will trouble the best.  However South Africa's greatest strength lies in their flawless fielding, with Jonty Rhodes as their talisman, and their pace bowling. The contrasting trio from the recent Test series -- Donald, Pollock and Matthews -- are joined by the irrepressible Fanie de Villiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odds: 11-2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Arab Emirates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UAE were the surprise winners of the ICC Trophy in Nairobi in 1994, which assured them a place in this World Cup. They are led by Sultan Zarawani, one of only two nationals in the squad (the other is Saeed Al Saffar), a player more noted for his captaincy skills than his spin bowling or lower-order batting. The rest of the squad are made up of exiles from Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odds: 2 000-1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Australia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Australians, in Group A, should justify their status as hot favourites. Mind you, they were in a similar position four years ago on home soil when they bombed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time they have sensibly introduced fresh bodies and minds into their squad -- Michael Bevan, recalled with immediate success for the World Series matches; Ricky Ponting of Tasmania, Stuart Law of Queensland and Shane Lee of New South Wales (22), a no-nonsense all-rounder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the old-timers are not that old. The Waugh twins, arguably the world's best one-day cricketers, have finally reached the age of 30. Steve will clock up his 200th one-day international during the World Cup and is playing the best cricket of his life. So is kid brother Mark. Taylor is a positive leader. McDermott now has more reliable support from McGrath and Reiffel. There's also Shane Warne. But no favourites have won the World Cup since West Indies in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odds: 5-2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> India</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No home side have ever won the World Cup. But this little statistic will not worry the Indians. The final is in Lahore and India have a good chance of making it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike their neighbours', India's cricket has been notable for its stability in the past five years. Regional rivalries have not spilt on to the cricket field. Under Mohammed Azharuddin's dignified captaincy India have yet to lose a home one-day series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The form of the vice-captain, Tendulkar, is critical. He has been opening the batting so that his dazzling strokeplay can exploit the 15-over regulation. If the little genius (and he's still only 22) fires, India win.  He also bowls his medium pacers with supreme confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their main bowlers have all flourished in English county cricket -- the fast-improving Srinath, Kumble and the arch streetfighter, Prabhakar. If the Indians have a weakness it is in their fielding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odds: 9-2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kenyans, runners-up in the ICC Trophy, are improving rapidly under the guidance of former Indian Test player Hanumant Singh. Their squad includes three teenagers: Odoyo, Patel and Suji. They are led by the impressive Maurice Odumbe, a prolific run-scorer as well as a handy off-spinner. Like all the minnows, their batting is more impressive than their bowling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odds: 2 000-1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sri Lanka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through no fault of their own, the Sri Lankan cricketers may yet be denied home advantage in their preliminary matches against Australia and West Indies, but they should qualify for the quarter-finals anyway. No one dares to take them lightly any more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their strength lies in an experienced batting line-up, five of whom have played in more than 100 one-day internationals. Skipper Arjuna Ranatunga, a canny left-hander, has been playing Test cricket since 1982. His deputy, Aravinda de Silva, is capable of destroying any attack. Maha-nama is a steady opener while Tillekeratne has two one-day centuries against the West Indies to his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However their bowling is weak. They rely heavily on makeshift trundlers and tweakers. Moreover, their young off-spinner Muralitharan has been called for throwing in Australia. The Sri Lankans have included him anyway. Given all the recent confusion in Colombo Muralitharan is the least of their worries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odds: 8-1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> West Indies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have the best batsman in the world -- Lara -- and arguably the best bowler, Ambrose, yet they are still unfancied for the World Cup, which they won under Clive Lloyd in 1975 and 1979. West Indies (minus Lara) were beaten to the finals of the triangular World Series tournament by Sri Lanka, a clear indication of their decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The return of Lara should guarantee more runs in the upper order if not greaters harmony in the dressing room. Richardson has clung to the captaincy and must start scoring some runs if he is to keep it. Holder replaces the injured Hooper while there are recalls for veteran off-spinner Roger Harper, who has recovered from the &quot;yips&quot;, and Cameron Cuffy, the beanpole paceman.  To succeed they need Bishop to stay fit, one of their young batsmen --Campbell or Chanderpaul? -- to assert themselves and their fielding to return to former glories. It would also help if Richardson and Lara shared a few rums together in pursuit of a common agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odds: 9-2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The largest of the minnows, Zimbabwe could embarrass other Test-playing countries. The Flower brothers' opening partnerships can be breathtaking, if only for the instinctive understanding and speed of their running between the wickets. Heath Streak, a quality new-ball bowler, could be partnered by Henry Olonga, Zimbabwe's first black Test player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odds: 200-1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Business Report has a new editor who says he is sharpening the market-place battle with main rival Business Day. Business Report is gearing up to supersede Business Day as the irreplaceable financial daily for business people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the editorial side, the rivalry is hotting up with at least eight senior reporters being recruited on to the Business Report team, and plans are well underway to have the supplement carried by the Sunday Independent in a bid to improve weekend business coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when it comes to advertising, the new kid on the block still lacks support, with Business Day having cornered the bulk of advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business Report, usually eight pages, is carried by various newspapers in the Independent group, and has a circulation of 182 850 (January to June 1995) while Business Day (an average of about 32 pages daily), for the same period, has a circulation of only 36 960.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the immense difference in circulation figures, Business Day still has the lion's share of business-orientated advertising. According to Nielson Adindex, the advertising shared by these two publications for the period April to November 1995 converts into Business Day carrying 64,8% of the brand advertising (which excludes financial reports) while Business Report has 35,2%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What Business Report lacks in advertising, it makes up in its gung-ho approach to its editorial efforts. Business Report's first editor, respected writer Jim Smith, only lasted until January when his successor, Peter Bruce took over the reins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bruce (43) is the new broom sweeping clean. His office is modest, stark almost. On the desk sits the computer and on the table is a large ashtray, semi-full of cigarette butts. &quot;Smoking in my office is obligatory,&quot; he said this week as he lit a cigarette before detailing his history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bruce was born and bred in Umtata but spent most of his time abroad with work-related spells all across Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the autumn of 1978, he left for London and began a lowly job at the Financial Times. &quot;I then began clawing my way up the editorial ladder during my time at the Financial Times,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly 10 years later, he was Financial Times' home-desk editor when he accepted an offer from the Independent group to head its latest venture -- Business Report. He replaced Smith, who moved on to become features editor in the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It didn't take much persuasion for me to return. Although I had travelled extensively, I had never had the chance to carve out a home anywhere. England is expensive, cold and lonely, it never felt like home and returning to South Africa felt right,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I believe that I could do things that weren't being done before and with the press in a dilapidated state since the early nineties, I thought I could make a contribution in correcting that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bruce runs his fingers through his greying hair before starting his assault on his self-confident rival whose offices are a block away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Business Day is fat and lazy. It's complacent, and who can blame it, having dominated the financial reporting field for a decade with no competition,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He leans back in his chair: &quot;Business Report could not destroy Business Day and that is not our objective at all. I am glad Business Day is around because it gives us something to shoot at. Nothing gets the adrenaline going as much as competition and nothing makes you work harder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Our objective is to set a new agenda for readers and to find new stories. We definitely do not aspire to be a paper of record as Business Day purports to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I want added value from my reporters. While Business Day is not a bad newspaper, it's stretched in its ambition to be a paper of record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bruce sees Business Day's business coverage as its &quot;vulnerable side&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unlike Business Day, I don't have to worry about the general news of the day. All I have to concentrate on is the business side of things and with this sole purpose, I can ensure that business coverage is of an excellent, in-depth quality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Business Day can continue on its cheery way and disregard us but our focus is to produce a good paper which will be of such value, it will become dangerous for businessmen not to start off their day by reading us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bruce said local business journalists were talented but because of the lack of competition, they sometimes failed to report beyond the obvious. He stressed that local reporters could walk into a job anywhere in the world but they were not pushed nor stretched to their full potential on local publications. &quot;Reporters have slid into notice-board reporting where companies want you to record things which they feel the public must read,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I want Business Day to remain an established newspaper and to worry about maintaining that position while I concentrate on excellence&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the issue of advertising, Bruce said part of the mountain that Business Report had to climb was to become credible and a necessary read, in a bid to attract and keep advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business Day editor Jim Jones sounded like a man who has seen and heard some of this before. He said Business Day's circulation had reached record levels in excess of 38 000 which was high for a &quot;serious newspaper&quot;. In contrast, since the advent of Business Report, its parent newspapers, the Star, The Cape Times and the Natal Mercury had all fallen &quot;precipitously&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Business Day does not seek circulation by scratch cards and so forth and yet our circulation is up by about 5,8% on the year before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jones said that because Business Report was an insert in mass circulation publications catering for a broader spectrum of people and Business Day was a &quot;niche publication&quot;, the latter was read and respected by the upper strata of business people as well as by politicians and unionists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business Day deputy editor Alan Fine said competition was always welcomed. &quot;The better the competition, the greater the challenge and how much of a challenge depends on how good the competition is,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fine said the entrance of Business Report had only done Business Day good. &quot;Since Business Report's advent, things have been getting bigger and better for Business Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Commercially, Business Report has not had a negative effect on us whatsoever,&quot; Fine said, refusing to take the bait offered by Bruce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't believe Business Day is complacent at all. In fact we have weathered the storm quite well by progressively expanding and improving our comprehensive financial and business reporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To try and separate politics and finance is silly because the two are so interlinked. One of the functions of Business Day is to indicate to government what it believes is economically possible and to indicate to business what it believes to be politically possible. I believe there is a place for both of us,&quot; Fine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Media Shop managing director John Barham said although Business Report had a bigger circulation, it also had more wastage. &quot;Although they are getting a lot of circulation via the Star, one cannot tell if everyone or anyone is reading Business Report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Business Day is a quick, precise read in the morning whereas Business Report, if you buy it at midday it has no fresh news -- it contains nothing you have not read already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Business Report definitely has its merits and must be seen as added-value to the newpapers which carry it. I don't feel there is room for two standing dailies and I don't think it will be as successful as Business Day in securing advertising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ivor Jones media analyst Peter Armitage said Business Day had an &quot;entrenched market and the big plus of the publication is that roughly three-quarters of its sales are via subscription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The papers attempt to do different things and Business Report handles in-depth articles while Business Day is to the point. Each caters for its own markets. It will be a gradual process but, given time, I think Business Report will secure more advertisers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Mozambique's rejection of Sappi's R200-million afforestation scheme has boosted the chances for a tourist development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maputo's rejection of pulp and paper giant Sappi's forestry project in southern Mozambique may have more to do with economic considerations than with green issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sappi's R200-million proposal to plant between 20 000 to 30 000 hectares of Eucalyptus trees, creating about 1 200 local jobs, may have seemed attractive back in 1991 when it was first approved but since then the government has had other carrots dangled before it, including a multi-million dollar tourism development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forestry project has also provoked a huge outcry from environmentalists who say Sappi's plantation would negatively affect the unique ecosystem of the area and was not the best form of land use.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cancellation of the project, announced in the press last week, took the R13,2-billion company by surprise as it had received no such indication from the Maputo government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sappi Forests managing director Barry Melrose said the company had been given a written undertaking by the minister of agriculture in August 1995 of the Cabinet's commitment to abide by a 1991 cabinet decision that unconditionally approved the afforestation scheme in southern Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only remaining issue was the total area to be afforested, which was subject to an environmental impact study. This study has been completed and has recommended an area of 21 000 hectares,&quot; said Melrose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he had spoken to the minister of agriculture on Monday evening, but was unable to find out for certain if the project was indeed cancelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The minister answered 'You know what the press are like' and suggested that we meet face-to-face on Thursday to discuss the matter,&quot; said Melrose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outcome of this meeting was not known at the time of going to press but it seems likely that Sappi will be asked to pursue the project -- in a different area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Melrose would not comment on the action Sappi would take if the deal was off and remained tight-lipped on whether he would agree to a proposal by government to relocate the project, saying he would not comment until he had spoken to the minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this week, Melrose indicated that no other area would be suitable for this specific project. The timber from the project would have been used to supply the Ngodwana mill, near Nelspruit, and the Enstra mill in Springs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The consequences of the deal being rejected means less timber would be bought locally and more bought overseas, and future expansions at these plants could be jeopardised,&quot; said Melrose. Sappi owns and manages 400 000 hectares of timber plantations in southern Africa, which supply only 50% of the company's domestic wood requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The costs of siting this project in the area proposed are reasonable as there is an existing rail infrastructure. The timber plantation would be sited about 120km from Ngodwana and is within economic transport costs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the forestry project were sited further north, the timber would have to be railed to Beira, shipped to South Africa and then railed again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Melrose said the company had explored other areas further north in Mozambique but these were being considered for a different type of project involving a processing plant. He added that the company would reconsider these plans if the forestry project fell through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the company had also had minor contact in Angola and other southern African countries and planned a full-scale investigation into available opportunities later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American entrepreneur James Blanchard, who plans to build an $800-million tourist scheme, which will create 12 000 jobs in the same region, called a press conference on Tuesday to commend the Mozambiquan government on its 'brave' decision to turn down the Sappi project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's a short-term loss for a long-term gain,&quot; he said. Although sketchy on the exact details of how the project would be financed, Blanchard said he believed he was close to winning a concession agreement from the government, which would be a stakeholder in the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was not concerned about the possibility that, like Sappi, any concession agreed on might be rejected later. &quot;I'm confident the truth is on our side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blanchard's project -- which he likened to a Sun City/Pilansberg-type concept -- includes the development of exclusive homes on the Peninsula connected by steam train railroad to the Maputo Elephant Reserve, which he intends restocking with game. Also on the cards are a casino and golf course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If granted the concession, Blanchard plans to sell sub-concessions to other developers to build the luxury homes. &quot;We'll invest in the infrastructure and bring in the game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Blanchard admitted he had no experience in this type of development, he said his area of expertise was in fund-raising and financial planning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - One of government's top priorities, and a key component of the Reconstruction and Development Programme, is the restructuring and rationalisation of the public service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Success in this political field is one of government's most important tests and indicators of its determination to deliver on its election promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Data from the Central Statistical Service (CSS) show that one year after the Government of National Unity came to power, fears about the public sector growing uncontrollably have proved unfounded. The wage bill has also not surged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The public service grew marginally -- from 1,24-million people in June 1994 to 1,25-milion in June 1995. But this is down from 1,26-mllion in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The quarterly wage bill dropped from R11,5-billion in June 1994 to R10,7-billion a year later,.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the state's contribution to funds are included -- namely pensions, medical aid, sick-pay and unemployment contributions -- the quarterly salary bill amounts to R13-billion in June 1994 and R12,3-billion a year later -- a drop from an average R3 502/month to R3 293.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is for the public service, whose salaries are paid out of the State Revenue Fund and accounts for some 38% of the total budgeted expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the public sector as a whole - that is the public service plus local authorities, public corporations, agricultural marketing boards, parastatal institutions, universities and technikons -- employment increased from 1,84-million in June 1994 to 1,86-million in June 1995 or 13,1% of the economically active population. The quarterly salary bill went up marginally from R17,548-billion to R17,552-billion. Average salaries fell from R3 185/month to R3 153.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for the composition of the public service, whites accounted for 22,3% of employees, 32,8% of the wage bill and 147% of the average wage in June 1994. By last June these figures were 21,1%, 32% and 152% respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the public sector as a whole, in June 1995 whites comprised 22% of employees (23,7% in June 1994), 33,9% of total salaries (35,9%) and 154% of average wages (152%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its white paper outlining its policy framework, the department of public service and administration, officially called the Office of the Minister for the Public Service and Administration, sets out eight priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of these is affirmative action. The main target groups are blacks, women and the disabled. No targets or time-frames are identified. But it is stated that &quot;within four years all departments must endeavour to achieve at least a 50% black management level and at least 30% of new recruits to middle and senior management echelons should be women. Within 10 years people with disabilities should comprise 2% of public service personnel&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result has been a dramatic change to the face of the top echelons of the public service. The data in the table above do not reflect trends within the year (CSS does provide quarterly data) but only compare two dates one year apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Employment numbers are the total full-time equivalent employees; that is, the number of part-time workers are converted to full-time equivalent workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government's first step was to rationalise and restructure the public service to create a unified national operation out of the fragmented state administration systems inherited from the apartheid era. The 1994 Public Service Act created the basis for integrating 11 administrations in South Africa, the former homelands and TBVC states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This process included restructuring senior management by filling posts.  The deadline for completing the integration and senior management shifts by May 1995 was extended to November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With this unifying process nearing completion, the emphasis falls on creating a more cost-effective service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The expectation is that a year from now CSS data will reflect a drop in employee numbers of about 100 000. Such a major transformation is inevitably complex and controversial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was highlighted by the sharp rebuke Auditor General Henri Kluever received from Minister Zola Skweyiya when he spoke about the civil service being like the Titanic heading for an iceberg. Kluever effectively expresses the many fears, especially among whites, over the future of the civil service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new constitution will influence the structure and function of the public service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister Zola Skweyiya's response expresses the aspirations and hopes of the RDP. He has an immense task to convince sceptics from outside about future standards, and those within about opportunities, without aggravating white fears and black aspirations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Glance at his curriculum vitae and one could be forgiven asking why Timothy Thahane should forsake an illustrious career at the World Bank to join the Reserve Bank as deputy governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Reserve Bank refutes the rumours, but there is no denying they are growing in intensity. Thahane is being groomed for the top job. Dr Chris Stals has three and a half years left to go on his current contract, and there is a dearth of potential successors within the bank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals, however, is adamant the appointment has nothing to do with his own future at the bank. &quot;We needed someone with international experience and regional know-how, someone with specialist knowledge of the African scenario.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As South Africa's role grows in importance within the African continent and globally, such experience is vital for an institution such as ours.  Thahane is amply qualified for the position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the subject of his own succession, Stals would not be drawn. &quot;I'll cross that bridge when I come to it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The finance minister was equally recalcitrant. &quot;I cannot predict the future,&quot; said Chris Liebenberg. &quot;But we chose the best man for the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thahane, no stranger to South Africa, having been involved in the Lesotho Highlands project as well as the Southern African Development Community, is enthusiastic about his roleas deputy governor, which he takes up in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He hinted at the Reserve Bank's staid image, but denied his appointment signalled a shake-up, either of personnel or policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The bank will continue to consult on a regular basis with politicians; it is not at variance with government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, he saw no reason to change the bank's modus operandi: &quot;The Reserve Bank functions much as other leading central banks -- it operates with autonomy but not outside the political structure. It is part of the process of government machinery, working with it, not against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But meeting the challenges facing South Africa may take longer than his five-year contract, he says. So there may be truth to the rumour after all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - &quot;The collection offered here will form the basis of a future museum against apartheid. But first these works will be presented in a travelling exhibition ... throughout the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus the words of the founders of the Art Contre Apartheid exhibition, the artists Ernest Pignon-Ernest and Antonio Saura, in the introductory catalogue essay written in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After wide exposure internationally (but, as far as we are concerned, waiting offstage for a decade and a half), Art Against Apartheid has made its South African appearance in the corridors and hallways of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An anticipatory article in the Mail &amp; Guardian raised a couple of pertinent questions: what is the exhibition doing in Parliament? Does it belong in the halls of power?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The short answer to that, in my view, is &quot;yes&quot;. For the six months it will spend in Parliament it has instantly assumed the kind of high profile it might not otherwise have had. It might also do a job of work.  Parliamentarians need to be exposed to creative energy, as opposed to the formulaic hagiography that is their usual visual backdrop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A more extended answer would have to qualify that &quot;yes&quot;. The exhibition has both the strengths -- in the symbolism of its genesis -- and the weaknesses, in terms of quality and coherence, that one could expect from high-minded gestures of this kind. It is a show of uneven quality. It contains some powerful works; but it also includes a lot of journeyman stuff that would scarcely raise an eyebrow if encountered within the usual art gallery context. Certainly for anyone familiar with the routine provocations of international art production of the Seventies and Eighties, there is no more than a core of work that is particularly challenging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But experiencing it within the corridors of Parliament gives the show a collective cutting edge and a thrust, heightened by one's awareness of the fallen icons it has supplanted. A couple of cases in point: works that have to do with themes of transience, such as Paul Rebeyrolle's painting Mortal Remains or Emilio Tadini's Body and Mask are unlikely to cause much of a flutter when encountered in a bland museum context. But experience them in close proximity to a display case that houses the Act to constitute the Union of South Africa of 1909, and you get a different kind of reading of the pervasive nature of transience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, Josep Guinovart's The Drape with its anthropomorphised St Andrew's cross (placed in the exact spot that housed a bust of Cecil John Rhodes) brings to mind the kind of crosses that people put into ballot boxes in April 1994, which ultimately made it possible for the work to get here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, inevitably, it is a cross of another kind that is likely to be the talking point of the show: Wolf Vostel's Black Crucifixion of 1982. Those who are able to recall the atmosphere in which artists had to work here in the Sixties may remember that a Johannesburg artist, Harold Rubin, had to face a charge of heresy for a work on a similar theme. Vostel's work, with its exposed bones and mocking reversals of traditional iconography, appears to have been the subject of some delicate shifting. It was originally displayed in the entrance foyer; it has now found its place on an upper floor where those who are likely to be shocked will at least have time to become acclimatised to its challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hanging team, aided by staff from the South African National Gallery, has done a good job in difficult circumstances. I like the way the optical works of Jesus Raphael Soto have been placed against the multi-coloured marble panels and floors of the new wing: a question of op art having to slug it out with the vulgarity of the architectural background, somewhere between post-modern art-deco and art bordello. The Soto wins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It might become clear, then, that anyone expecting a thematically unified show is going to be disappointed. What links these works has as much to do with gesture as original creative intention: that is to say the act of artists giving their work, as a token of solidarity, is as significant as the reason why they were made in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without wanting to be pedantic, to call the show Artists Against Apartheid would give a more accurate index of what the works are really about. Few of them deal with the substantive issues of racist ideology that drove the apartheid machine. Even fewer have any reference to South African identity. Only one series, by Gavin Jantjes, is of South African origin, informed by direct experience. (It is in fact related to work that he did as a student at the Michaelis School of Fine Art.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the few entries by international heavyweights that are specifically addressed to the anti-apartheid theme, the contribution by Robert Rauschenberg encapsulates the point, and limitations, of solidarity art. It is a 1982 collage, apparently designed to be reproduced as a poster, featuring two basketball players, one white, the other black. The work is untitled, but the artist has scrawled across the top of it: &quot;World artists against apartheid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And that is what the show is really about. Symbolism and solidarity have precedence over substance. This is not to underplay the importance of either symbolism or solidarity in the context of this show. Its very raison d'etre serves as an index to the broad range of international artists who felt sufficiently strongly about apartheid to give their work in the belief that change would come. But in its formal substance, this exhibition has primarily to do with the look of international art production in the Seventies and Eighties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, those with an eye for irony will be quick to note that the icons from the discredited past (whose displacement will be mourned by few) have been replaced by images which are likely to perplex many. Further to that is the added irony that, in the ongoing debate about cultural identity, with its sterile binary oppositions of Eurocentrism versus Africanisation, Parliament is hosting a show of unabashed eclectic internationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that's alright; even if it does nothing else, the exhibition might be the start of art education for some parliamentarians and even a challenge to others. For South African artists not exposed to international formalism, this show gives something to measure themselves against. And there need be no feelings of inferiority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, it would have been possible to put together a thematically focused show of work done by South African artists in the decades of the Seventies and Eighties which would more than hold its own. Isolation cut two ways. If anything, the local art community, even in the darkest years of apartheid, knew more about what was happening internationally than the international pundits knew about the quality of resistance art that was being produced here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now that we are back in the world and establishing our new identity -- from polecat to paragon -- we need to be careful about role models. Some of our official cultural institutions, notably our national broadcaster, have not kicked the nasty habit of knocking Eurocentrism while accommodating the worst of North American schlock. (Witness the parade of soapie mini-stars and silky lawyers who descended the stairs of the SAA Boeing which poked its nose, like some rerun of Airport with lasers, into the recent SABC TV launch.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several issues remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first is the fate of the pictures and portrait busts of the old order, which are now in storage and awaiting restoration. Where will they end up? Surely there is a case for evaluating and differentiating the displaced works. Whether we like it or not, they are part of the record. Not all of them have value as art. But we have to face up to our history. I notice that the parliamentary museum still exists. Filled with colonial relics, haphazardly displayed, it reeks of must and neglect. Surely there is a case for reorganisation here. Squaring up to our history inevitably means contextualising the new order in relation to the old -- and vice versa. It's a question of interpretation and we are not short of interpretive skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other issue is the fate of the Art Against Apartheid show.  Originally indicated as coming to the South African National Gallery, it is now under the custodianship of the Mayibuye Centre, which has thus far handled the issue with common sense and flair. After its projected national tour, where will it end up? Is there not a more creative alternative than a &quot;museum against apartheid&quot;? When that phrase was coined it was in the nature of an imaginary museum. Imagination now has to be translated into concrete terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final issue, no less important, is what kind of work is going to hang in Parliament once the current exhibition comes to the end of its six-month run. There is a strong case to be made for showing work by South African artists, including photographers, who kept their integrity in the apartheid years. That could serve as an instructive parallel exhibition to the present one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And after that we need more &quot;Madibagraphy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who will be commissioned to record the current government of national unity, and the dispensation that will succeed it? And who will be the new commissars? What is it about ourselves and our new era that we wish to reflect? The physical likenesses of parliamentarians, or the creative energy that they will need to draw on to build a viable and sustainable democracy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will artists be chosen who are capable of producing artworks over and above pictorial records? A critical honesty to replace the old hagiography?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let the debate begin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - They are called the &quot;lost tribe&quot;, a dispossessed community of black Muslims descended from slaves who live in the Indian township of Chatsworth. But the &quot;lost&quot; label, although well-intentioned, is both inaccurate and offensive. The Zanzibaris are not lost. They know where they come from, who they are and what they want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This virtually unknown community is the focus of a two-part documentary to be screened on SABC 1. Directed by Durban-based Junaid Ahmed and produced by the Centre for Democratic Communications, it examines the history of this insular group, their sense of cultural and religious identity and their double betrayal by both the old and new South African government -- undermined and oppressed by the former, ignored by the latter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story of the Zanzibaris is, in many senses, a microcosm of the history of all enslaved and exiled communities. Their existence can be traced to 1873, just after the abolition of slavery in Britain. Captured from East Africa by Arab and Portuguese slave traders, they were crammed into the dungeons of Zanzibar, awaiting export to Europe and the Middle East. But the British &quot;liberated&quot; 113 of them and shipped them off to Natal as indentured labourers, thereby rescuing them from one kind of slavery and imposing on them another set of shackles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly after this, another 500 traumatised and malnourished Zanzibaris were shipped in and the swelling community was scattered in overcrowded settlements around Durban. They were separated from the other &quot;Kaffir servants&quot; because they were Muslim, but denied schooling because they were deemed unworthy of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the indignities didn't end there. Land purchased for them by the Mohammedan Trust along Durban's Bluff area was expropriated by the Nationalist government after the Group Areas Act took effect in the early 1960s. And with the Population Registration Act, their pariah status was entrenched, not by the government, but by the surrounding Indian, black and coloured communities. The community, which numbers 10 000 today, was subjected to eight different racial classifications, including African, coloured, Indian and finally &quot;other Asiatics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I remember growing up near Chatsworth where the Zanzibaris were forcefully relocated,&quot; recalls director Ahmed, &quot;and thinking that they were intruders. I felt hostile towards them because they were black yet they were practising my religion. It was only later that I began to appreciate their strength and the degree to which racism practised towards them by oppressed communities had contributed to their plight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1995 Ahmed embarked on a small mission of restitution. Over 12 days, he filmed them, not as exotic curiosities, but as South Africa's smallest minority group whose fortitude and faith has remained constant in the face of overwhelming odds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result is a documentary which is notable for its beautiful footage and sensitive approach. It provides fascinating insights into the ancient customs still practised by the Zanzibaris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Circumcision, for example, is still performed on young boys. After the operation, the initiates are taken to a remote hut where they remain until their liminal period (the stage between boyhood and manhood) is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Young girls, although not subjected to &quot;operations&quot;, also remain in seclusion during menstruaton in order to successfully complete the necessary rites of passage into womanhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there is the ratieb -- an ecstatic Arabic dance traditionally performed by Muslim saints -- during which the trance-like dancers pierce their bodies as a reaffirmation of the power of their faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the film's subtexts is the role played by Zanzibari women who confound Western assumptions of female repression in Islamic societies.  Zanzibari women are not forced to hide their sensuality behind veils.  Although deeply pious, they seem to revel in the fulfilment of all the senses, as scenes of celebration and sport suggest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But most importantly, perhaps, the documentary focuses on the Zanzibaris' struggle to reclaim their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They are frustrated that the new government has ignored their rights, and have taken action themselves. The Zanzibaris Civic Organisation has been formed, through which they are staking their land claims and seeking ways of improving their conditions&quot;, explains Ahmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the greatest peril facing the Zanzibaris lies ahead. Overcrowding, a 90% unemployment rate, the increase of alcohol and drug abuse and the inevitable lure of greener pastures might well subjugate the community more effectively than the dungeons of Zanzibar or the matchboxes of Chatsworth ever could.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zanzibaris will be screened in two parts on SABC 1 at 7pm on February 20 and 27.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Ostriches and rooibos tea provide insights into how South Africa can prevent the pillaging of its fauna and flora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plight of South Africa's wild plants and animals has been in the news lately with the publication of two hard-hitting reports that document a large-scale, illicit drain of valuable indigenous species from the country over the past two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kumleben Commission's report described extensive illicit trading in ivory by the South African military in the 1980s, while a study by Traffic, an international body which monitors illegal trade in fauna and flora, found a thriving illegal trade in South African birds, reptiles and plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both reports propose more stringent regulations and customs control, with additional resources for police and other enforcement agencies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But two South African species - the ostrich and a type of fynbos that grows only in the sparse climate of the Cedarberg - provide useful lessons about how expensive state controls can be supplemented with measures that promote responsible entrepreneurial use of indigenous products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wildlife conservation in South Africa has in the past been dominated by a protectionist mindset: game reserves were fenced off and patrolled by paramilitary anti-poaching patrols; bureaucratic permit systems were set up to control the export of animals, plants and fertile embryos of native species; and rigid agricultural marketing controls restricted innovative industries which could have made constructive use of wildlife products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This policing-from-above approach, along with government restrictions on legal commerce in wildlife, involved inevitable failures, mainly because the state lacked the capacity and finances to enforce its regulations. Today, the new government is even more hard-pressed to release funds for conservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recent histories of the ostrich and the rooibos leaf show, in different ways, how commercial and entrepreneurial exploitation of plant and animal products can provide more vibrant, cost-effective and efficient ways to preserve rare species - without taxing ordinary people and the state's coffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African Black Ostrich, whose genes were originally indigenous to the Karoo, is the basis of an extremely profitable rural industry - even though the fashion market for the bird's feathers, which first provided the impetus for farmers to domesticate them, collapsed in 1914.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are valued for meat, in high demand in many European countries because of consumer fears that beef carries mad cow disease. The skin is prized for quality leather products. Eggs are used in the curio industry.  Oil, for cosmetics and moisturisers, is extracted from their fat. Feathers are used to make non-static dusters for computers. There is a specialised demand for feathers from the organisers of Mardi Gras carnivals like the one in Rio this month. And bones and toe nails are crushed to make bone meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sid Birch, an ostrich farmer in the Little Karoo, estimates the industry has the potential to earn the country a whopping R550-million every year in foreign exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem lies in the way the Klein Karoo Co-operative imposed a tough, single-channel marketing system on farmers until October 1993, insisting that it handled the sale of all ostrich products. The co-op also pressed the government to legislate, in terms of the Livestock Improvement Act, against the export of fertile birds and eggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result: smugglers had a field day, sneaking birds out through Namibia and Bophuthatswana, while South African farmers were forced to accept prices for their birds way below the international market levels. There were few incentives to develop local meat-processing plants or tanning factories which added value to the bird's primary products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, farmers in other unlikely parts of the world began working with smuggled South African birds, which are prized over species found in other parts of Africa because they are more docile, female birds lay more eggs than their counterparts, the chicks mature more quickly and the skin of our ostriches has more pimples - making it more attractive in the leather market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now Texas has nearly as many African Black ostriches as Oudtshoorn.  Italy has plants that turn the meat into salami. There are 50 modern ostrich farms in Britain, mainly in the Oxfordshire district. They have so many African Blacks running around on them that a local animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, is demanding that the government protect their welfare. And Holland has 120 ostrich farmers whose birds have adapted surprisingly well to the cold climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ostrich industry in South Africa was deregulated in the late 1980s after farmers took legal action against the monopolistic practices of the Klein Karoo Co-op. Bird farming has since taken off all over the country and these wild animals have spread to almost every province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But all this may have come too late. The single biggest obstacle to expansion of trade in ostrich products is this country's failure to capture the international export market at an early stage - especially for manufactured goods with added value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The increasing international interest in ostrich farming (with the giant South African bird) is posing a threat to the ostrich industry and its worldwide dominance,&quot; reports an October 1995 edition of Farmer's Weekly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rooibos, or Aspalathus linearis, presents the opposite lesson in how creative commercial use can cultivate a national species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Records show that Khoisan people used the leaf to make a tea-like brew for centuries. White settlers then used it. The first modern industry began in 1904, but it only really took off when a group of local entrepreneurs formed the Rooibos Co-op which, despite its name, operated as a private-sector company from 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 18 000ha has been put under rooibos cultivation, much of it farmed by small-scale coloured farmers in the Clanwillian area. About 4 700 tons of the tea is produced annually with close on 2 000 tons being exported. No single player controls the market and growers are allowed to trade freely.  The result: a vibrant local industry which, unhindered by government interference and red tape, has captured the international market and has created a significant source of livelihood for small farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The different experiences of the bird and the tea leaf underscore two vital points. South Africa is among the 10 countries with the richest biological diversity. This natural wealth has, if managed in a flexible but strategic way, a massive potential for creating rather than consuming funds for conservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commercialisation creates several opportunities: it provides new activities for farmers and alternative crops; it develops a technology and research base that can be applied to other potential products; it diversifies the economic base (especially in a sector prone to natural hazards such as drought and flooding); and it creates multiple job opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This marks a major shift from a protectionist approach, to creating more value out of our primary natural resources, which traditionally would be exported and re-imported as manufactured products at higher prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lesson is simple: if we don't encourage economic development that thrives on the rich diversity of this country's natural assets, the threats to our biological riches will triumph.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The South African Museum in Cape Town is planning to develop a &quot;sensitive and responsible&quot; curatorial policy that takes into account the interests of all stakeholders in a collection of human bones, skulls, skeletons, and 14 plaster casts of Khoisan women's genitalia, which were collected by scientists during this country's period of colonial rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patricia Davison, assistant director at the South African Museum, said this week that the museum had about 1 500 skulls, teeth, jaw-bones and &quot;post-cranial bones&quot; (bone material other than skull) in its skeletal holdings, which derive mainly from Khoisan groups who lived in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the skeletal material in the museum had been actively collected by academic researchers, but much was donated after being discovered by members of the public.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The museum also houses a collection of body casts that were taken from living Khoisan people between 1904 and 1927. There are 69 full body casts of naked men and women, and 14 casts of female genitalia that were collected as part of a project which sought to record what was thought to be a vanishing racial type (see main story).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The museum has always allowed academic researchers access to the collection and is now taking note of a growing debate in academic and human rights circles about how to manage the presence of controversial human remains and images of indigenous people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the case of physical anthropology collections, scientific views have changed considerably since the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ...  Physical anthropologists no longer study human skeletal remains in relation to racial typology, but with regard to the physical development of humankind and the relationships of people to changing environments through time,&quot; said Davison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Griqua National Conference, which claims to represent the interests of Khoisan people, last month wrote to President Nelson Mandela to demand that he intervene to ensure that various remains of indigenous people are returned, and an end to &quot;dehumanised portrayals&quot; of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technolgy Ben Ngubane then announced he has had contact with his French counterpart to demand back the pickled brain and genitals of a Khoisan woman called Saartjie Baartman, stored at the Musee de l'Homme in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And this week Chief Nicholas Gcaleka from the Eastern Cape plans to take a delegation of traditional healers off to Scotland in order to find the head of a famous Xhosa warrior chief, whose head was allegedly cut from his body and taken to a military museum after being killed in battle against British colonial troops in the 1830s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our policy is to be entirely open about our holdings and to work together with relevant stakeholders in the process of negotiating a curatorial policy that is both sensitive and responsible,&quot; Davison said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the museum would negotiate with any legitimate party which lodged a claim for human remains housed in the museum, and it was considering ways to meet any demands that may arise without destroying scientifically valuable material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The Southern Africa Museums Association (Sama) has invited an Australian specialist in cross-cultural studies to address the issue of sensitive material in museum collections at its forthcoming annual conference in Kimberley in April. It is recognised that policies regarding human remains must be developed in partnership with relevant institutions and community groups,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The historical importance of the collection should not be overlooked.  Collections from the past are powerful reminders of the ideas that contributed to the shaping of cultural identities and thus have an important educational and cultural role to play in the present.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - After recent publicity raised by indigenous peoples' activists over human body parts in museums, South African curators are arguing that these artefacts are still of educational and cultural value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Khoisan communities were first subjected to the European gaze,they were portrayed, by and large, as barbaric: without religion, without morals.  Their language was considered a babble, their behaviour beastly, their habits inhuman and their bodies were seen to reflect these qualities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as Europeans expressed disgust at the apparent moral corruption of Southern African aboriginal people, they were almost absurdly fascinated with Khoisan genitals - and the fixation was reflected in a series of academic expeditions that set out to photograph, cast and study these peoples' body parts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ideas of European racial and intellectual superiority were promoted by an almost obsessive need to establish physical difference. By the middle of the 19th century, Khoisan bodies were considered so extraordinary that thousands of people in England and Europe were prepared to pay to see them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were apparently the pygmies and the cranes that Herodotus had described, the strangest of people at the furthermost corner of the earth.  The London papers at the time of the Great Exhibitions described the &quot;Bosjesmans&quot;, or &quot;Earth People&quot;, or &quot;African Pygmies&quot; as &quot;resembling monkeys&quot;, &quot;cruelly deficient of all the attributes which belong to human beauty&quot;, &quot;clucking&quot;, or &quot;dwarfishly savage&quot;, with their minds in &quot;torpid darkness&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When a Khoisan woman called Saartjie Baartman was taken overseas in the early 19th century and exhibited in London and Paris, it was not only the &quot;prodigious size of her buttocks&quot; (as it was described by St Hilaire of the Natural History Museum in Paris) that was the great source of fascination, but the imagined strangeness of her genitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Travellers such as Le Vaillant, in the 18th century, had painted images of women flashing long pendulous labia. Captain Cook, when he visited the Cape, had written that the &quot;Hottentot&quot; women had labia which &quot;resembled the teats of a cow&quot;, and reports had reached Victorian English ears that some women had labia, like an apron, which hung down to their knees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the end of the 19th century, Khoisan bodies had been the subject of hundreds of photographic &quot;essays&quot;. Most of these photographs were part of scientific projects that examined racial difference. Many of these photographs survive in museum collections and archives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Typically, they depict men and women, standing naked against a measuring stick, from front and side views. Many collections also included images which particularly focused on genitals; men being photographed most often to the side to show the tilt of the penis, and women being persuaded to grasp their labia to expose their length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the profusion of these images, both published in early photogravure books, and unpublished, (and the many that she herself took), Dorothea Bleek, South Africa's first female anthropologist, was able to write in 1911 that it was exceedingly difficult to get &quot;photos of the natives without their clothes on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the scientific community in South Africa was concerned to preserve some physical trace of what they perceived to be a race of people heading for extinction. These were known as the &quot;Bush and Hottentot races&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1907 the director of the South African Museum, Louis Peringuey, wrote to the Cape government for support to find &quot;pure specimens&quot; whose bodies could be cast, and thus who could provide a lasting record of their vanishing &quot;type&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For more than 50 years, photography had provided this record; now Drury, the museum's modeler, was to begin a project which would result in remarkably lifelike figures, finely and accurately painted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of Drury's &quot;brief&quot; was to cast separately the genitals of a number of women. This involved the packing of plaster (which, as any art student will tell you, when it sets will prick and burn) around the labia majora and into the folds of the labia minora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That this was achieved, and with such detailed accuracy, speaks of an extreme degree of coercion, in which women were persuaded to expose themselves in a most undignified way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Drury and his colleague, Drennan, wrote of research he had done into the genitals of the &quot;Bush race&quot;, he described his experience in the following way: &quot;On asking a woman of these tribes to remove her loin cloth or apron, one could not at first detect any difference between her and an ordinary woman ... On separating the lips of the vulva it was easy to grasp the labia minora with a pair of forceps and pull them out for examination.  This increased exposure gave rise to a distinct accession of shyness on the part of the women ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The body casts, dressed in skins, are still on display in the South African Museum, set in painted and idealised dioramas, and the genital casts are kept in a safe in one of the museum's storerooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khoisan people of the 19th century are no longer seen as an homogeneous racial type, but as a diverse population comprised of different cultures with their own languages, histories and practices which, like all cultures, have changed and accommodated new influences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marking, scarring, mutilating and analysing the body have always been ways of portraying cultural or ethnic difference and superiority - and such motives clearly influenced science and anthropology a hundred years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this does not mean that the casts, as well as the photographs and documents, that pertain to the whole colonial process of structuring racial difference are not valuable and precious artefacts that must be preserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenge facing museums is to come up with new methods of display and presentation, so that this material may be recast in the light of contemporary thinking,and the role they can play in understanding history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The irony that we should remember, however, is that the methods used by 19th century scientists, and the museum objects they produced, tell us more about the European mind than anything about the people they sought to describe, classify and ultimately subjugate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - When he was a reporter at the Rand Daily Mail in the late 1970s, Zwelakhe Sisulu led a group of black colleagues from the publication on a protest march to John Vorster Square, where they were summarily arrested. Upon release, they were summoned into a senior editor's office, who bawled them out: &quot;How could you do this? It's a discredit to the paper!&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sisulu challenged the editor: &quot;I'm baffled. What we did was a concrete expression of the Mail's editorial policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ah, this is where you don't get it,&quot; the editor responded. &quot;You don't march. You write!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sitting now in an office on the top floor of a perpetual controversy about the relationship between the public broadcaster and government, Sisulu remembers that earlier confrontation as a watershed: &quot;For me, it showed the thin line that, in a sense, was beginning to define me out of South African journalism; that I was now, in a sense, a black activist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cleaving a branch for his own personal destiny apart from that of his legendary family, Sisulu insists that &quot;I did not set out to be an activist.  My activism began with my journalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He spent two years in devastating detention; he set up and edited the New Nation, the ANC's functional internal mouthpiece; his political profile has propelled him to the most powerful media position in the country. And yet Zwelakhe Sisulu's professional identity solidified in those five years, from 1975 to 1980, when he was a working journo in the newsrooms at the South African Association of Newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he carries with him, even now, the psychology of the journalist; a psychology captured most pithily by that doyen of post-war British journalism, James Cameron, who said something along the lines of: &quot;Every day, when I sit down at the typewriter, I think, 'This time they will find me out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zwelakhe Sisulu is high on the charm. He is clever, articulate, charismatic, and blessed with those gemutlische Sisulu features that radiate hospitality and dependability; cheeks you could settle into with a cup of tea. But, like most good hacks, he is palpably insecure; one senses, lurking beneath the bluster, a man who feels he's a little bit of an imposter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An example from the SABC gossip mill: For months, Sisulu took his lunches at the Johannesburg Country Club across the road from the SABC. Then, one day, his secretary called to make a reservation, and was told that if Sisulu wanted to continue dining there, he had to become a member. He has not been back since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story says much about Sisulu's diffidence. A government official, who has known him for years, says &quot;He is one of the shyest people I know.  When I looked at him at that launch, I saw an expression on his face which seemed to me to be saying, 'I just want to sit in my office and do my job! I don't want to be on stage in front of a Jumbo Jet.' Zwelakhe is a low-profile person with a high-profile name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His dilemma is that he carries with him not only the name but the chromosomes of his parents. He was propelled into leadership by those around him who saw this. Thus was he pushed, by fellow black journalists, into leading the Writers' Association of South Africa (WASA) in 1977. Thus was he pushed into setting up the New Nation in 1986; into becoming heir apparent at SABC in 1994. There is as much duty (filial or national) as drive in his upward mobility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His contract at SABC expires in October next year. Will he make himself available for re-appointment? He will not say. He believes, however, that he will eventually go back to newsprint: &quot;There's no doubt in my mind that TV is the medium of the present and the future. But I do still think, if one wants to engage intellectually, that print is the best way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of his senior staff, with much experience in television, says that &quot;he has been here for two years, and I still don't get a sense that he has any passion for television. TV just doesn't seem to be in his blood; he doesn't have an instinct for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He agonised over his appointment and took it, say those close to him, with extreme caution and anxiety. These emotions, unfortunately, were writ large on his features every time he spoke. He had a hard time fostering confidence or providing vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His greatest error, once he became chief executive in 1994, was to announce far-reaching reforms and objectives, and then not implement them speedily: employees feared retrenchment and rapid transformation, and then, when it didn't happen, the air at the SABC became poisonous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been, for the past three years, a nightmarish place: rudderless, chaotic, back-biting, anguished. Last year, as more and more people &quot;took the package&quot; and got out, Sisulu and his senior staff found themselves concentrating more on strategic planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Things fell apart while no less than five bulky instalments of the SABC's vision-document, &quot;Delivering Value&quot;, were presented to the Independent Broadcasting Authority. (Sisulu is the first to admit the wrong-headedness of this, and blames the IBA for &quot;not being clear about what it wanted from us.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His detractors in the sector -of whom there are many- feel that Sisulu, lacking confidence, has been overly reliant on bad advisers and that he has shielded himself from the corporation with a ring of yes-men (he is obsessed with &quot;loyalty to leadership&quot;). They point, too, to the appalling way that the New Nation was managed, and at Sisulu's very poor relationship with journalists there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the SABC, and the South African broadcasting sector, have often proved themselves to be better producers of bile and gossip than programming.  How fair is the flak Sisulu gets?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, I have found myself riveted to the screen almost every single night since the relaunch ten days ago. I've seen some brilliant documentaries (mainly from Britain); some great old movies (Midnight Cowboy); some inspired magazine programmes (the Channel 4/SABC co-production, Africa Express, on Monday nights); and more than a little lunacy masquerading as language policy - like the debate between Jacob Zuma and Frank Mdlalose last Thursday. The two native Zulu speakers, after having been introduced in Setswana, spoke English to each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Never mind the Babelish proportions of it all and the fact that non-Setswana speakers mightn't even think to tune in -thereby missing a critical debate. Far more worrying is the dishonesty of it all: that programme was as much Setswana-speaking as I am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there's the local content issue: a cursory glance at Wednesday's schedules reveals that, out of 24 hours of viewing on SABC1, only two and three-quarters are locally produced: of that, only one and a half were produced externally, outside the SABC. Much the same is the case on SABC3, and the ratios on SABC2 are only slightly better. Sisulu answers these and other criticisms of the schedule with the rote -but not unacceptable- response that &quot;we are building capacity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As to the criticism that the launch sent the wrong message in having both President Mandela and broadcasting minister Pallo Jordan offering perorations, he is unswayed: &quot;We couldn't do better tactically than getting the President and Pallo to say, in their own words, that the independence of the public broadcaster is inviolate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mandela said something else too: he called Sisulu &quot;Comrade Zwelakhe&quot;. It was more likely the collegial greeting to the son of his oldest friend than the deliberate attempt to make a political point, but the effect was nonetheless the same. Which brings us back to marching versus writing, or, in this case, broadcasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sisulu's record - party loyalist or free-expression warrior - is ambivalent. Launching WASA at a conference in 1980, he maintained that all journalists were &quot;propagandists&quot; - the question was simply whether &quot;one is a collaborationist propagandist or a revolutionary propagandist ... if expressing the aspirations of the people is propagandist ... then surely we are propagandists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His role at the New Nation was unmistakably one of publicising the ANC; not inappropriate, given the ANC's banning. But, says one senior journalist who worked with him there, &quot;as soon as things started getting more complicated, and there were a number of conflicting ANC positions, he found himself in trouble&quot;. The paper, for example, steered well clear of the Winnie Mandela controversy - another instance of Sisulu's life being complicated by his family connections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, at the moment of the ANC's unbanning, Sisulu - also unbanned - connected immediately with his mother-movement; working as Mandela's first press attache. Later, though, he stalled when offered the editorship of the ANC's ill-fated daily newspaper: he was apparently uncomfortable with the control that would be wielded from Shell House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, at the SABC, he is under constant pressure from government. A revealing incident took place at the time of Joe Slovo's death. TV news had, ill-advisedly, decided to broadcast only an hour of the state funeral. Sisulu received calls from dozens of parliamentarians demanding that the whole event be screened from start to finish. According to sources at Auckland Park, Mandela even phoned, and Sisulu - knowing that he would not be able to say &quot;no&quot; to the Old Man - told his secretary to say he was unavailable. The eventual decision, taken by the chief executive himself, was based entirely on &quot;newsworthiness&quot;: the proceedings were screened for only two hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zwelakhe Sisulu feels that the relaunch of television was yet another watershed for him: he confesses to having been terrified that &quot;it might not happen&quot;, but, now that it has, he clearly feels more confident. One of his senior managers feels that &quot;he is growing in confidence, now that he believes this job isn't beyond him after all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One senses, too, that he has also grown weary of marching, and desperately wants to start writing again. Whatever his future trajectory - first black editor of the Sunday Times, member of Parliament, political columnist - he is unmistakably part of the new ruling elite, tied by the umbilical cord to South Africa's destiny. Two of his siblings, Max and Lindiwe, chair portfolio committees in Parliament; his sister-in-law, Sheila, is special adviser to the Minister of Education and a member of the SABC board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pippa Green wrote about the Sisulus in Leadership in 1990 that you could &quot;measure the political climate&quot; of apartheid South Africa by the Sisulu family's &quot;suffering, its fears, and its hopes&quot;. That was at the moment when the family was reunited after 30 years of exile, imprisonment and perpetual harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, perhaps, you can measure this land's reconstruction, and the vagaries of the new black power elite, by the Sisulu family's current achievements. Unlike that lift that takes you to Zwelakhe Sisulu's 28th floor office, things are going up quickly. It's kind of hard to get off, even if deep down you think you might want to.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Opposition parties in Soweto have come together in an attempt to rob the African National Congress of its dominion over local politics. But, already, it's not plain sailing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Community Alliance Councillors (CAC) is a coalition of former candidates of minority political parties who clubbed together on their own accord after they were trounced by the ANC in the local government elections last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the past couple of weeks they have been meeting regularly at a Soweto secondary school. Now they believe they have found that elusive formula which might pave the way for a national initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In what they presume will be a massive show of strength, on February 17 they will be holding a rally at the Jabulani Amphitheatre in Soweto, where leaders of minority political parties whose members serve in the structure are scheduled to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The executive committee of the coalition, however, is hitting snags already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The alliance is dominated by the Democratic Party and draws also from the Pan Africanist Congress; from a horde of &quot;community-based organisations&quot; which mushroomed just before the elections - such as the South African Residents Association (Sara) and the Community Indaba, as well as from the Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A vengeful Inkatha Freedom Party is partially inside, still busy hitting out at its Soweto leaders like Timothy Mtshali who, prior to the elections last year, dumped the IFP branch chairmanship and stood on the card of Sara.  Mtshali is on the coalition's executive committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to IFP spokesman and Gauteng MPL Humphrey Ndlovu, Sara was meant to have been the IFP's &quot;surrogate and younger sister&quot; but, &quot;to our surprise&quot;, it was not to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndlovu feels such things need to be cleared first, although he said he &quot;instructed&quot; his party members to attend the coalition's meetings, &quot;while we are planning to sit down and discuss it fully&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP, on the other hand, has expressed doubts and reservations. But the party's Ben Madumise is also on the coalition's executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What initially gave birth to the coalition, according to organiser Sam Makurube, was solidarity. &quot;We were harassed just for being members of the DP and for putting up posters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As to what will happen beyond the 17th and whether the respective political parties will be able fund the coalition's programmes to weaken the ANC, Mtshali said &quot;we cannot divulge anything at this stage, but we have something&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Vusumuzi Vincent Thusi, a Gauteng National Party MPL, gazes up at the pictures on the walls of his party's reception room in the chamber, then smiles wryly at the unfolding contradiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Do you remember those chaps?&quot; he asks, pointing at the huge pictures of Hendrik Verwoerd, Hans Strydom, DF Malan, and PW Botha. &quot;They are the ones who thought we would vanish from the face of this earth. This party must bury all those photographs.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thusi is one of the new recruits to a political party still haunted by its ugly past and desperate to fill a vacuum in opposition politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To achieve its goals, many believe the NP needs to strengthen its credibility among black voters, as well as show that its transformation is more than cosmetic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NP leader and deputy state president FW De Klerk announced lrecently that plans are afoot for a new-look party. He announced that Roelf Meyer, Minister of Constitutional Affairs, will relinquish his position at the end of this month to focus on rejuvenating the party as its first secretary general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, as black NP parliamentary representatives admitted this week, the roughest road still lies ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Thusi: &quot;We have a lot of white people who, for a long time, were living a different lifestyle and felt that blacks were not really human beings. Now, coming into the party, I am fighting to make them break loose of that attitude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds: &quot;I must be honest with you. Some do not share the same ideals that De Klerk and some of the top leadership share. Some still feel that, as a minority white grouping, they can do something, but fortunately they are in the minority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In parliamentary discussions, the party sometimes puts its black members in awkward situations which have a serious impact on their attempts to recruit for the party in the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator David Malatsi, the most senior black in the NP, blames this on the fact that the party sometimes criticises where it should not, like lashing out at RDP minister Jay Naidoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not that the NP should not criticise &quot;non-delivery of certain issues&quot;, Malatsi argues, but it should bear in mind that the RDP is meant to &quot;redress imbalances of the past&quot;. Although some of the criticism is valid, he says, it is often &quot;not communicated properly&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malatsi is deputy leader of the NP in Mpumalanga, and is mooted as a possible candidate for the post of deputy speaker, which is to be vacated by Dr Bhadra Ranchod who will be taking up a diplomatic post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dilemma of black NP leaders, however, stretches beyond the friendlier walls of Parliament to the attitudes of some of their colleagues in the dusty townships, where &quot;the spirit of tolerance cultivated by President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President FW de Klerk has not, as yet, permeated&quot;, according to Malatsi, where the main problem he has encountered is the &quot;intolerance of the ANC alliance structures on the ground&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Has the NP really changed? &quot;It has changed,&quot; insists Thusi, &quot;it's just that the baggage of the past is too much for people to realise that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The biggest problem faced by the black Nats is credibility. Says Thusi: &quot;If you speak on behalf of the NP, to a very large extent you are not talking policies but race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The NP has really shed its past. It's just the perception that still exists. People still see old Nats who were known for certain things which were hurting black people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'When I looked at what De Klerk wanted to achieve, I felt 'here is one leader, white leader, who has led his people, taking them from those dark ages of apartheid, of Verwoerd and all those guys. He is trying to bring reconciliation, I must try to assist (him).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To assist De Klerk, Thusi joined the NP in 1993 from the dungeon of the discredited black local authorities, of which he was a councillor despite, by his own admission, &quot;knowing full well that the structure was illegitimate&quot;.  But he has no regrets: &quot;I had to respond to the calling of the people who voted for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding the possible change of the party's name and of forging alliances, he agrees there has to be a move, &quot;even if it means we must leave the NP to form a new movement with new norms and standards&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His dream party will first have to &quot;submit&quot; itself to God, &quot;whether we call him Allah or in Hindu&quot;. Secondly, it must look after minorities. &quot;A Venda who comes to Gauteng should not find that the Zulus are dominating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we bash the whites for merely being white and for belonging to the NP, we'll lose a lot of expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'We need more people of colour, who must come into the party and hold them (whites who want to leave the country) by the hand and say: 'Look, you are part and parcel of South Africa in spite of all the wrongs you have done.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question of a black leader for the NP? &quot;It's a simplistic way of looking into the matter. A mere black face will not help. What will help is when the power is with the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This process (of a rejuvenated NP) will breed a new leadership which will change the terrain of our political spectrum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to inculcate a new mindset into our political terrain. As things are now, we are moving towards a one-party state, which is not good for our fledging democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malatsi adds that the NP needs to be proactive, otherwise, if it concentrates on being in opposition, &quot;it will remain so even when there is nothing to oppose&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela has cracked the whip in the African National Congress's parliamentary caucus with a ferocity that took MPs aback and left some bruises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a strongly worded address to the first caucus meeting of the year, he warned MPs not to act in ways that could destroy, in one stroke, months of painstaking effort at fostering national reconciliation - and reminded them that &quot;nobody is above the ANC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The focus of his anger was a recommendation made last month by Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Defence that English replace Afrikaans as the language of command in the South African National Defence Force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Singling out committee chair, firebrand Tony Yengeni, for a stinging rebuke, he spoke of the effort he had put into building national reconciliation and his concern that it could be undone by a single action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela was addressing the caucus last Thursday, the day before he delivered the opening parliamentary address that called on South Africans to rally behind a new patriotism and work together to make the country a winning nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that Mandela was furious about the way the matter was handled by the committee and particularly angry that he had not been consulted before any announcement was made on an issue he is said to view as a matter of extreme national importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Informing the committee's recommendation on language was a belief that by maintaining Afrikaans as the language of command and instruction, new SANDF members who did not speak the language would be disadvantaged in terms of their integration and promotion in the defence force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela intervened swiftly after the committee announced its recommendations, which included the suggestion that no religion be imposed in the SANDF and that there be no discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. It is known that he met Defence Minister Joe Modise and his deputy, Ronnie Kasrils, as well as SANDF chief George Meiring, who issued internal SANDF communication bulletins to the effect that these decisions were not final and that the status quo would remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela later told a gathering of leaders of Afrikaans women's organisations that he had told the committee it was &quot;completely wrong&quot; and that if one wanted to &quot;reduce the country to ashes&quot;, one had only to tamper with the language of a group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His message in caucus was that MPs should realise they were in government because they had been put there by the poorest of the poor, and that nobody could put themselves above ANC policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He outlined to the caucus all the efforts he had made to bring Afrikaners into the new political order and accept reconciliation, listing all the disparate Afrikaans groups which he had met. He warned MPs that he would not allow individuals to destroy these efforts and pledged to stop them from doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Committee member Lindiwe Sisulu Guma was also singled out. Mandela addressed her as &quot;my daughter&quot;, but surprised those present with the directness accompanying his attack. Other committee members allegedly named by Mandela were Linda Mti and Thenjiwe Mtintso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One caucus member, who declined to be named, said that Mandela was right in what he said &quot;but when the old man goes over the top, he really goes all the way over&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Approached for comment, Guma said the issue was &quot;too sensitive&quot;. Yengeni also declined to comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The National Party has caved in on its central constitutional demand and the African National Congress says it does not believe it will be challenged by the Nats in wrapping up negotiations on the final Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Inkatha Freedom Party and the drafting of Kwazulu-Natal's provincial Constitution and its re-entry into the Constitutional Assembly remain a perpetual headache to the ANC, the NP is laughed about behind its back, and ANC MPs talk openly about the Nats' &quot;stupidity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week, Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer asked the negotiators in the Constitutional Assembly to scrap the clause in the draft final Constitution which would entrench power-sharing after 1999 - a central demand in the NP's constitutional package.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC negotiators say they are bemused at how easily the Nats conceded this principle and have developed a newfound contempt for them for not putting up more of a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said ANC negotiator Dirk Du Toit: &quot;The NP has no big constitutional vision left and it is too late for it to develop another ... it has nothing left to trade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'That's cheap politicking,&quot; retorted Meyer this week. &quot; I don't know what the ANC is talking about. The Constitution does not only consist of the Government of National Unity - there is a whole variety of checks and balances we want in the Constitution, which we have put into our submissions.  There are other alternatives on the table. All we have conceded is that the model of the GNU as it now stands should not be continued. You can't be in a GNU and be an opposition party, it goes against the grain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the most important checks and balances on executive power will be vested in provincial governments and the debate on this chapter of the final Constitution continues behind the scenes. These bilaterals, however, are characterised by growing consensus rather than party political disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sacrifice of the GNU principle reflects the belated drive within the NP to become an effective opposition party. It reflects the realisation that he who attempts to have his cake and eat it - be within the GNU and oppose it from within Cabinet - ends up with the crumbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was apparent in FW de Klerk's first speech in Parliament this year.  He drooped to new impotence when he pleaded with the ANC to recognise in its government partner an opposition worthy of respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Please listen to what I say,&quot; he said to mocking ANC MPs in the National Assembly, &quot;and then debate with us ... on the basis of what we are - and not on the basis of taking pot-shots at the distorted image of us that you yourselves have created.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democratic Party leader Tony Leon is chuckling at the NP's first real attempts to establish itself in opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;FW is like an ugly person on a first date, trying to talk his way past his face - 'I have inner beauty,' he's saying ... it's all rather pathetic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scrapping the GNU clause from the Constitution means that De Klerk and his better-looking crown prince Roelf Meyer will ultimately have to rely on the crumbs from the ANC's table until they develop the sort of inner resilience, spite and spunk that being an opposition party demands. If there is anybody in the NP who realises this, it is Meyer, whose withdrawal from Cabinet indicates that he would rather develop the National Party's power base through working in civil society than cling to a seat in an ANC-dominated Cabinet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - An African National Congress MP, who spent 11 years in exile in Mozambique, has written to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission urging it to &quot;get to the bottom&quot; of cross-border raids and attacks during the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rob Davies, formerly a researcher at the Centre for African Studies in Maputo, analysed the war waged by the former regime against South African exiles and neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Questions Davies wants answered include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l Who authorised South African Defence Force (SADF) support for Renamo and what, if any, rules of engagement or operational orders applied, given the numerous atrocities committed by Renamo troops against Mozambican civilians? Co-ordinated by the Department of Special Tasks 2 of the Chief of Staff Intelligence of the SADF through an operation code-named Mila, this support was supposed to have ended with the 1984 signing of the Nkomati Accord. Two accused in the Malan trial were involved: Colonel Cornelius Johannes van Niekerk and Colonel Cornelius Jacobus van Tonder.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l Who authorised continued support for Renamo? The &quot;Gorongosa documents&quot; captured at Renamo headquarters in 1985 mentioned generals Constand Viljoen, Jannie Geldenhuys, PJ van der Westhuizen, Kat Liebenberg as well as a Major Philllips who worked with Renamo in Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * What role did SADF personnel play in supporting Renamo and on whose orders? Who ordered the use of specialist saboteur teams - including a mid-1987 push which resulted in massacres of hundreds of civilians at Homoine and Manjacaze?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * What operational orders were given and what were the rules of engagement in the Matola raid in 1981, the first of a series of attacks on &quot;ANC bases&quot; - homes in a suburb outside Maputo?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * What are the long-term consequences for the victims of the 1983 South African Air Force raid in which the creche of a jam factory bore the brunt of an attack on what the SADF claimed was a &quot;terrorist base&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * What was the role of Cabinet-level decision-making in cross-border raids? What was the role of then foreign minister Pik Botha and his depatment? If there was Cabinet-level decision-making, did it also involve the head of the government, PW Botha?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davies has offered to make documentary and research material he has collected available to the commision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Department of Foreign Affairs admits a &quot;communication problem&quot; delayed co-operation with a United Nations commission investigating embargo-busting arms exports - from South Africa, among others - to Rwanda's defeated Hutu army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delay, which embarrassed South Africa at the UN's Security Council, is the latest hitch in efforts to clamp down on illicit arms trafficking to and from South Africa, and to clean up the country's image as an international arms rogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lack of effective law enforcement to ensure compliance with South Africa's new arms control policy is understood to be a key issue in the second report to President Nelson Mandela by the Cameron Commission, appointed in 1994 to investigate illegal weapons trading. The report, delivered to Mandela late last year, has not yet been made public.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department of Foreign Affairs liaison staff this week said inadequate &quot;communication&quot; at South Africa's New York UN mission appeared to be the reason the government had not responded to a request for information from the UN investigative commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Affairs Deputy Director General Abdul Minty said: &quot;We are trying to find out what happened, because it would be bad for us to appear not to want to give an answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN Security Council established the investigative commission last September after allegations that its arms embargo against the former Rwandan government's army was not complied with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The allegations, first made by the US-based Human Rights Watch, included that South African officials, said to be members of the Armscor old-guard, had helped arrange a 1994 arms consignment from the Seychelles to forces of the former Hutu government, and that clandestine consignments were flown directly from South Africa early last year. The Hutu army and allied militias perpetrated most of the 1994 genocide in the Central African nation, and have been exiled in neighbouring Zaire since their defeat at the hands of the Rwanda Patriotic Front later that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lack of co-operation with the commission almost led to its premature closure, when UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in a letter accompanying the commission's interim report to the Security Council on January 29, recommended the commission be disbanded, apparently because of its lack of progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That report of the commission said it was &quot;persuaded&quot; the allegations were true, but that it had been unable to gather sufficient evidence. The report singled out China, South Africa and the Seychelles as not having responded to requests, made in November and early December, for information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week the Security Council, against Boutros-Ghali's advice, extended the life of the commission and resolved to protest formally to countries not co-operating. The commission has, in the meantime, visited the Seychelles, where it is understood to have found information supporting the allegations against South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Cameron Commission is soon to start its own investigation into the Rwanda allegations - but after a six-month delay. A request from the commission in the middle of last year for permission to appoint an investigative arm to look at the claims was approved by Cabinet last year, but the commission was notified only last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commissioner Laurie Nathan said this week policemen had been approached and were willing to serve as investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nathan said while South African arms control procedures had been reformed, they were not policed adequately, and that responsibilities seemed not to have been assigned. &quot;In the view of the Cameron Commission, enforcement agencies, including the police, intelligence agencies and Customs and Excise, should have a formal brief to monitor the flow of arms into and out of South Africa, investigate allegations of illegal traffic in arms, and should be formally incorporated into the government's arms control system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the weaker links in arms control is South Africa's smaller airports, a number of which have no customs presence after hours - a problem government has been aware of for a while. It is understood the National Intelligence Agency monitored some airports after the Human Rights Watch allegations were made in May last year, and found unscheduled cargo flights - which could have been carrying arms or other contraband - were indeed taking place.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Minister of Justice, Dullah Omar, wants key elements in the Constitution protecting individual rights watered down to facilitate the government's fight against crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omar said on Thursday that he would support amendments to the Chapter of Rights protecting citizens' rights to privacy, freedom of information, and the rights of an accused to bail and legal representation. He also indicated that he supported a tougher stand in dealing with pornography, saying adults needed to be protected from it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement presented at a parliamentary briefing session for journalists, Omar conceded that his proposed dilution of fundamental rights was &quot;controversial&quot;. But he said that &quot;a starry-eyed and over-romantic approach to the question of rights is costing our country too dearly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister cited three sections of the Constitution which he said were giving an advantage to criminals:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l Section 13, which says that &quot;every person shall have the right to his or her personal privacy, which shall include the right not to be subject to searches of his or her person, home or property, the seizure of private possessions or the violation of personal communications&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l Section 23, which says &quot;every person shall have the right to access of all information held by the state or any of its organs at any level of government insofar as such information is required for the exercise, or protection, of any of his or her rights&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l A section making provision for an arrested person to be released with or without bail &quot;unless the interests of justice require otherwise&quot;, and for legal representation of a person's choice &quot;where substantial injustice would otherwise result&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omar also suggested that Section 33 of the Constitution - a limitation clause on certain rights - should be reviewed &quot;to give the state greater capacity to fight crime by imposing reasonable limitations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Questioned about the justification for limiting freedom of information, Omar said it was particularly important, in dealing with the prosecution of organised crime, that suspects do not have access to police dockets &quot;at a crucial period of investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also supported critics of the government's latest censorship Bill who regard it as too permissive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am for freedom and individual liberty, but I do think there is a need to protect children; there is even a need to protect adults&quot;, said Omar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to look very critically at the Bill, to ensure that we are not just giving the green light to pornography. Maybe I am very conservative in that regard, but that is my view.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Frustration among African National Congress MPs about the way Parliament is functioning is focusing on the role of the Speaker in the National Assembly, ANC MP Frene Ginwala - said to be &quot;about as popular as a rattlesnake in a lucky dip&quot; among members of her own party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Criticisms that were only whispered during the strains of last year's session - with a Parliament that had a radically new way of operating, but had still to reform its staffing and structures in order to cope - have now reached a crescendo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the corridors this week there was talk that at least three ANC whips wanted to resign and that committee chairs - the overwhelming majority of whom are ANC MPs - were reaching the end of their tethers. It has been widely rumoured that Deputy Speaker Dr Bhadra Ranchod's decision to quit for a diplomatic post lay in part with differences he had with Ginwala's approach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acutely aware of the gossip and backbiting, Ginwala said this week: &quot;People forget I was elected by caucus. I was not appointed by the ANC. It was a contested election. If I lost the confidence of caucus I would resign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She had been prepared to answer to criticisms at an ANC caucus meeting last year and had gone to it prepared to do so, she said. &quot;The issues were not raised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike past speakers who left Parliament's running to the secretariat and its civil servants, Ginwala swept into office determined to reshape the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her hands-on approach brings her into regular contact with staff, whips and committee chairs and thus also exposes her to criticism. No one questions her efficiency, but her management style is described as high-handed and autocratic. Critics say this results in people feeling disempowered and frustrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are those who defend her. &quot;Many of the frustrations people are experiencing are not her fault, but lie with the administration. She sets very high standards and this doesn't go down well with a lot of people. But the honeymoon is over and we have to get to work,&quot; said an ANC whip. &quot;People should also question whether the whips are functioning as they should.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ginwala's chief problem appears to be a lack of communication within Parliament itself. There is widespread confusion about the massive R82,7-million transformation project she is driving. Democratic Party leader Tony Leon says she is &quot;building an empire&quot; and wants to know to whom she answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The political agreement she forged before seeking foreign funding appears fragile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was agreed that Parliament should be funded from public coffers as a matter of policy and that any private funding should be temporary, with any costs arising phased into Parliament's budget over three years. But within ANC ranks there is lingering concern at the message this sends about the possibility of undue foreign influence on Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A major area of dispute revolves around the functioning of portfolio and ad hoc committees in terms of their scheduling and funding, and their relationship with the executive and the National Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Committee chairs want funds to pay for support such as researchers and also to perform duties other than processing legislation - such as attending conferences, making foreign trips, visiting the provinces and arranging public hearings on Bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chaotic arrangements last year saw the house repeatedly in want of a forum because members were in committee. Members of minority parties found themselves required to be at several meetings simultaneously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ginwala's attempts to have a line drawn between the work of the National Assembly and that of committees and her unyielding grip on the purse strings has not endeared her, and it has been suggested that she is involved in a power struggle, determined not to allow the committees -- a powerful bloc - to undermine her. She dismisses this. Committee requests for funding go not through her but a separate committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Last year I instituted fortnightly meetings with the chief whips, saying I needed to consult on a range of issues. Every single thing has gone through them. It is not my responsibility to consult with individual MPs,&quot; Ginwala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There was no political agreement on how committees should be funded. A committee was set up and tasked to draw up guidelines and regulations on the funding of portfolio and ad hoc committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This committee, chaired by the chief whip of the majority party, was set up in March last year. It has not yet produced any regulations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guidelines were necessary because there was no common view on the role of committees and their relationship with the National Assembly, Ginwala said. Key questions, including ethically fraught issues such as whether committee chairs should be allowed to raise funds from foreign donors or private companies, were among a range of questions that had yet to be answered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ginwala admits there are flaws in the transformation project documents: they were drawn up against a tight deadline to negotiate funding from foreign donors. Any problems would be worked out during implementation, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MPs returned to Parliament for the new session with the hope that last year's problems would have been sorted out and that they would have support in the form of administrative and research back-up. Staff are being appointed and help is on its way. But a lack of communication is compounding frustrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC chief whip Reverend Arnold Stofile would not respond to questions about tensions between him and Ginwala. &quot;I would rather say that we in Parliament are many MPs who had not worked together before. Naturally there are bound to be tensions from time to time, but we are dealing with this.&quot; He denied &quot;categorically&quot; that there were ANC whips who wanted to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC whip Jannie Momberg said: &quot;If whips or chairs have problems with the speaker, they should be aired in forums where they meet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DP whip Douglas Gibson said: &quot;You just have to compare her with other speakers - like Louis le Grange - and thank heaven for the new South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It has been reported that the Amnesty Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has already received 2 000 applications for amnesty. The question is: &quot;Who will receive amnesty and who will not?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To establish an acceptable amnesty test will be a very difficult task for the committee, because the granting of amnesty since 1990 has been a messy and dishonest affair. Direct political interference, double standards, blackmail, secrecy and unlawful administrative acts all featured strongly in the granting of amnesty to date. To develop an acceptable amnesty test, the committee must, in terms of truth commission legislation, take cognisance of criteria applied in the past.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In terms of the legislation, the committee must grant amnesty if the offence committed was done for political reasons, in proportion, and therefore justified, if weighed against the political objective that was pursued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee, therefore, has to work, firstly, with a very vague proportionality test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Namibia, Professor Norgaard developed a set of rules to help establish when amnesty could be granted and when not. Many Namibians who had committed political offences were not granted amnesty because their deeds were judged to have been too serious and, therefore, out of proportion to the political objective pursued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, the committee is charged to apply the norms that were used to grant amnesty in terms of the 1990 and 1992 Indemnity Acts. This will cause the committee enormous headaches, because the proportionality norm (Norgaard Principles) and the other norms used in terms of the 1990 and 1992 Indemnity Acts are not compatible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To understand the committee's problem fully, we must revisit the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1990 Indemnity Act states that &quot;for the sake of reconciliation and for the finding of peaceful solutions&quot; amnesty had to be granted. The upshot of this was that thousands of prisoners - the exact figure is unknown - benefited. These prisoners received the normal one-third remission of their sentence, but, in addition to that, they received one full year simply because they were &quot;related&quot; to the African National Congress (ANC). Prisoners who belonged to other political parties did not and could not benefit from this strange remission arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the thousands who received remission, many others were granted amnesty. Initially, the Norgaard Principles were applied. More than 8 000 ANC members automatically received indemnity because they fell into certain categories and 1 400 applicants, all ANC members, were released on an individual basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, the ANC were still not satisfied. They rejected the application of the Norgaard Principles and requested the release of all &quot;political&quot; prisoners. The government, however, was adamant that the Norgaard Principles should be applied and a stalemate ensued. The ANC then walked out of the Codesa talks in June 1992 and insisted that 350 prisoners - the names of whom it published - should be released before it would return to the negotiating table. In response, the 1992 Indemnity Act was passed. A new test to qualify for indemnity was developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In terms of the new test, a prisoner had to be released if the release might &quot;promote reconciliation and peaceful solutions&quot;. Robert McBride, Barend Strydom and others who had received the death penalty or life sentences were released. A total of 168 long-term prisoners, nearly all of them affiliated to the ANC, benefited. With few exceptions, all of them had been sentenced for murder, and even multiple murders. The party returned to the negotiating table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the April 1994 elections, Minister of Justice Dullah Omar appointed the Currin Committee to attend to pending amnesty applications which were lodged before May 6 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee carried out its task in the most extraordinary manner imaginable. It arranged for 56 people who were sentenced, but not in jail, to receive remission, 86 prisoners who were in jail were released and 104 people who had not yet been sentenced received indemnity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee acted outside its mandate by arranging for amnesty to be granted to people whose applications had previously been rejected and, therefore, were not pending. They also granted amnesty to criminals who had committed crimes of a non-political nature. The many non-political prisoners released included the following: Jabulani Khubeka, ANC, sentenced after the death of Stompie Seipei; Elian Mabena, ANC, robbed and shot the owner of a taxi; EK Mabilu, ANC, sentenced in 1994 to 18 years imprisonment for killing people he believed to be witches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The common feature of the criminals released by the Currin Committee is that, with very few exceptions, all were ANC members or ANC sympathisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee has been most kind to the ANC and its followers. It is not surprising that the ANC component in the Justice Committee has decided to protect the Currin Committee as best it can and has, to date, refused all requests to have the curious conduct of the committee investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister of Justice Dullah Omar has also come to the defence of the Currin Committee. He said in Parliament, when he was questioned about the erratic behaviour of the committee, that he was very happy with its work!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, most ANC members or sympathisers have already received amnesty or indemnity. They are immune, therefore, from criteria the Amnesty Committee may apply. The only exceptions are the 77 top-echelon ANC members, like Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and ministers Joe Modise and Pallo Jordan, who were granted temporary indemnity. The Amnesty Committee will have to deal mainly with security force applicants, their ANC opponents having escaped the net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The relevant legislation demands that the committee ensure an even-handed approach between those who have already received amnesty and those who still have to receive it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee will have to make a close study of what happened during our recent history of amnesty granting. They will find inexplicable, unlawful and sordid things have occurred. How will this influence them? What criteria will they develop out of this chaos? We will all be watching with great interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - A major church news agency, the News Network International (NNI), ceases operation soon owing to a financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The network has over the last several years concentrated on highlighting the plight of the suffering Church worldwide, supporting the rights of individuals to hold their religious beliefs and has provided background information for lobby groups of religious freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter dated February 8 to correspondents of the news agency, the Publisher and Chairman of the Board of Directors Mr. Richard Burow said funding priorities by a major donor of the NNI had changed and the news agency will no longer receive an annual grant. There was not enough time to look for alternative funding and so the board made the decision to close down permanently.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no doubt that NNI has made a lasting impact on the importance of reporting on religious freedom issues. The rights of individuals are important and I believe we have successfully made many aware of what happens when nothing is said in the face of great injustice,&quot; said Mr. Burow in his letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency which officially closes its doors on February 29, 1996 has supplied news and information to editors globally, filling the void in reporting on the church around the world and its particular problems and concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NNI has keenly reported on the conflicts and persecution of Christians in Muslim dominated countries and harassment against the church. The aim has been to support the cause of the voiceless and the persecuted church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency has had an editorial staff of close to 20 people scattered all over the globe. Major supporters have included foundations, organizations and individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Mr. Burow: &quot;We trust we have provided a valuable service to those who have not had a voice or access to the media...As scripture states so well, for everything there is a season and NNI has had quite a season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency published a bi-monthly news and feature service by the same title and a monthly in depth feature service &quot;Perspective&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freetown - A national consultative conference in Sierra Leone has voted to go ahead with elections scheduled for February 26, despite pleas from Head of State Brigadier Julius Maada Bio and Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels for a postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time the government and rebels have agreed to send delegations to Ivory Coast for talks on February 28, two days after the planned elections, to end the five-year-old civil war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the conference in the capital, Freetown, last week, Brigadier Bio urged delegates to postpone the presidential and parliamentary elections until after talks had been held with the rebels as the latter had requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But reports say 80 delegates from political parties and civilian groups rejected the delay and urged the government to proceed with the polls.  Brigadier Maada Bio, who seized power in a bloodless coup on January 16 this year, agreed to hold talks with rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, during a radio conversation the two men had last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sankoh called for the postponement, saying with the raging civil war, it was useless to hold elections. &quot;Without peace in the country, the elections will prove futile,&quot; he said during their conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He denounced politicians as corrupt and blamed them for Sierra Leone's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, as the date of elections approaches, tension is mounting in the capital with attacks reported on election officials and arrests of some political party leaders for unspecified charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Late last week, it was reported that unidentified gunman in Freetown attacked the home of the national Electoral Commission Chairman, Mr. James Jonah, and the commission offices. No one was hurt in the grenade and gun incident.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - Zimbabweans at home are asking serious questions about President Robert Mugabe's unlimited trips abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabweans, suffering from the effects of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank inspired economic reforms want their leader to cut foreign trips to save scarce funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Famous writer and winner of the prestigious Commonwealth Noma Award for publishing in Africa, Chenjerai Hove, in an opinion article published in the weekly Financial Gazette here recently wrote; &quot;Despite the fact that this Government is clearly broke, the nation is continually informed of our President travelling to all sorts of places.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hove said the expenses are borne by a nation struggling to feed itself, a nation that has lost the worth of its citizens. &quot;Our nation would like the president to remain in the country to go around the country talking with various sectors of the leadership of this country at all levels, seeking solutions to our problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter to the editor of the Sunday Gazette, one writer complained bitterly about the President's trips abroad. He wrote: &quot;I wish to register dissatisfaction with the way the Government is handling its monetary affairs.  I have read in newspapers about ministries being ordered to be very strict about their expenditure, public investment programmes being suspended for lack of money and the health budget being cut by Zimbabwe dollars 23 million (US dollars 240,000), all this is being done in the name of reducing Government expenditure, fair and fine but I feel the Government should take stern measures in the reduction of overseas travels by Government officials including the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The writer said he thought the President is travelling more than necessary. Concluded the writer: &quot;We have tightened our belts beyond limit and our waists are about to rapture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition politician Wururayi Zembe, Secretary-General of the Democratic Party (DP) said President Mugabe's trips abroad can be likened to an &quot;absentee landlord. Mugabe is hardly in the country for consecutive 30 days,&quot; said angry Zembe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An irate newspaper vendor had these harsh words for the President: &quot;Why then appoint ministers if he (President) wants to do everything by himself.  Why are there two vice-presidents for a small country like Zimbabwe, why do we have foreign missions and why do we have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&quot; The southern African country has a population of some 9 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vendor said Zimbabwe is a poor country which cannot afford such visits. The vendor added; &quot;Why can't Mugabe behave like (President) Bakili Muluzi of Malawi who could not go to other meetings of Heads of State because his country did not have money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;How can Mugabe justify that the government has no money for the Zambezi water project to bring water to the people of Matebeleland,&quot; asked one Bulawayo (in the south) city resident who has endured water rationing for the past three years. Another Bulawayo resident who only gave his name as Victor for fear of victimization, said he was disappointed by the attitude of the government which was painting itself good outside while its people were suffering.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nyeri, Kenya - Peace building in Africa should emphasize the structural causes of conflict, delegates to a meeting here, marking the 12th anniversary of the Nairobi Peace Initiative (NPI) have recommended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 50 delegates, meeting in this Central Province town, some 170 kilometres north of the capital, Nairobi also stressed the need to promote capacity building in order to develop Africa's capabilities to deal with conflicts. They were drawn from different countries in Africa, Europe and the Americas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace education, directed at everyone particularly the youth and strategy development through information sharing and analysis should also be developed, the delegates meeting here from January 28 to February 1 further recommended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On its part, the NPI shared its views for establishing a long-term educational programme for peace in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The programme is aimed at assisting co-workers in various conflict situations to play roles of mediators, peacemakers, reconcilers, healers, peace builders, thinkers and trainers,&quot; said Mr. George Wachira, a programme officer at the NPI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NPI which works closely with churches and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) dealing with peace issues, was instituted in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi in 1984, under the name-Nairobi Peace Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its formation then was seen as a response to events in the Horn of Africa. In that year, massive drought swept through much of the continent and its effects were felt mostly in the Horn of Africa where thousands of lives were lost as a result of starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An international NGO, whose aim is to promote peaceful resolution of large-scale social conflicts in Africa, NPI was started by concerned Nairobi-based scholars and church leaders as a discussion and reflection group to explore ways of addressing chronic conflicts in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The name, Nairobi Peace Initiative was adopted in 1989. Over the years, the initial Nairobi Peace Group has grown from a discussion group to an organisation that undertakes peacemaking and reconciliation roles in many civil wars and countries in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vatican - Pope John Paul II has sent a message of congratulations to Muslims the world over as they mark Idd-Ul-Fitr, a feast celebrated at the end of the holy month of Ramadhan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his message, released by Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze, who heads the Pontifical Council for Inter-Religious Dialogue, here, the Pope observed; &quot;For us as Christians and Muslims to reach beyond tolerance to reconciliation and love, there is still a long way to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The head of the Roman Catholic Church in his message emphasised that Christians and Muslims can become an example of reconciliation and instruments of peace in today's world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year's papal message to the Muslims as they mark the end of Ramadhan is based on the theme, Beyond Tolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The papal message does not carry the date of the commencement of the feast (Idd-Ul-Fitr) because the marking of the occasion differs from one region to the other depending on the sighting of the moon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talking to APS, Kenyan Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ali Shee, said &quot;there is already discussion among Islamic scholars that the sighting of the moon should be standardized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As of now, there is some confusion. The local sighting of the moon take precedence, yet there exists an international system of sighting the moon. My only hope is that one day, we, Muslims, shall be able to go by the international standard of sighting the moon,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sheikh Shee noted that in some parts of the world, the sighting of the moon becomes controversial when some Muslims decide to follow the local system while others go for the international method.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his message, the Pope says... &quot;I take this opportunity of offering you my heartfelt greetings. Throughout the month you have fasted, prayed, and shared, with those in need what God has given you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Describing the time of fasting as a privileged period for asking pardon for sins committed and seeking to be reconciled with God, Pope John Paul II emphasises; &quot;For Christians too, pardon is important, for according to the Gospel, God will grant pardon to those who repent their faults if they in turn grant pardon to those who have sinned against them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pope says relations between Christians and Muslims are continually on the increase but stresses that &quot;it is not only the weight of the past that has to be taken into account.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The grievious conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina for example has been falsely interpreted by some as an example of Christian-Muslim confrontation, he observes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the Christian-Muslim relationship in the Sudan, Pope John Paul II in his message, says, &quot;the war in southern Sudan, protracted for so many years, has doubtless many causes, but the state of relations between Muslims and Christians can be considered as one of the elements contributing to the conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In some countries, the condition in which various minorities find themselves can be a source of tension, the Pontiff notes, adding..&quot;These sorry situations call for reflection on our part, reflections carried out in God's sight in order to set them right.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Windhoek - The Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) has urged all people of goodwill to write to Zambian President Frederick Chiluba and urge him to stop the persecution and harassment of three journalists working with a Zambian newspaper, The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trio comprises Editor-in-Chief Fred M'membe, Managing Editor Bright Mwape, and Special Projects Editor Matsautso Phiri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three have been charged with treason and being in possession of a banned publication (their own newspaper issue dated February 5).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three journalists are currently out on bail of Kwacha 250,000 (US dollars 250) granted by the High Court on February 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They had been detained on February 5 following the publication the same day of classified information (plans submitted to the cabinet for a referendum on a new constitution).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Frederick Chiluba summarily banned the February 5 edition of the bi-weekly Post saying, the newspaper had contravened Section 4 of the State Security Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to human rights organisation, Amnesty International, the charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although out on bail, the State has asked the court to review bail terms but the court has delayed judgement until February 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the judge decides bail can be reviewed there is a likelihood the three will return to jail unless they can successfully argue their case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post is well known for crusading investigative journalism. In 1994 as Managing Director of the bi-weekly, M'membe was summoned to give evidence in the trial of a minister who accused President Chiluba of drug trafficking, an allegation made at a press conference. M'membe declined to testify since other newspapers were not called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier the same year, he was charged following the publication of controversial remarks by another minister who had quit his post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paper is well known for its efforts to expose corruption and mismanagement of State resources in Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - The British envoy to Uganda, Mr. Edward Clay has renewed his attack on Uganda's Chaka Mchaka (political emancipation) courses, equating it with political indoctrination. Ugandan authorities insist Chaka Mchaka is the equivalent of civic education within a strict military environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a congress of Uganda's mayors, town clerks and other municipal leaders in south-western Uganda on February 9, Mr. Clay, among other criticisms related to Uganda's forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections due in April/May, lamented the continuation of Chaka Mchaka courses. He said it was a matter of regret to see the courses continuing unabated when elections were so near.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But speaking soon afterwards, his host, Uganda's Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda challenged the British envoy, telling him to be ready to undertake a Chaka Mchaka course at the Kyankwanzi School of Political Education in central Uganda &quot;so that he knows exactly what is offered.&quot; The course normally lasts a couple of weeks, but Dr. Rugunda offered to design a shorter course for Mr. Clay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Rugunda said Chaka Mchaka was considered &quot;a very important course that had enabled Ugandans to know and understand their country - its history, politics and economy.&quot; Even more important, said Rugunda, Chaka Mchaka &quot;had demystified and democratised the gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Yoweri Museveni who introduced Chaka Mchaka when he assumed power 10 years ago, said Uganda had been ruled by dictatorial regimes in the past who had terrorised the citizens because peasants in particular were mentally ill-prepared to resist tyranny. He insisted that by teaching people their rights in addition to drilling them militarily, future dictators would have an uphill task in subjugating Ugandans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of Ugandans in responsible posts have undertaken the Chaka Mchaka courses at Kyakwanzi over the last 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of Uganda's opposition leaders have previously called for the abolition of Chaka Mchaka. Prof. Dan Nabudere, a self confessed socialist and member of the Uganda Peoples Congress, (UPC), called for the abolition of the Kyankwanzi School arguing that the courses amounted to political indoctrination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kabale, Uganda - A priest of the White Fathers, Monsignor Robert Gay, is the new bishop of the Diocese of Kabale in Western Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The announcement of his appointment was made by the head of the Catholic Church in Uganda Emmanuel Cardinal Wamala who said the appointment by the Pope was based on the recommendation of the Uganda Episcopal Conference. It became effective on January 22.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monsignor Gay, a Canadian, replaces Bishop Barnabas Halem 'Imana who resigned in July 1994, following an act of rebellion by two priests within the diocese of Kabale which in turn split the congregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matters became chaotic at the height of the crisis in mid 1994, a fight ensued at the church resulting in damage to property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two priests in the diocese refused to go on transfer as ordered by the Bishop and instead resorted to writing a series of protest letters to higher authorities of the church. A number of churches were reportedly closed due to the activities of partisan groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following Bishop Halem 'Imana's resignation in July 1994, Monsignor Gay took over on a caretaker basis. He will be ordained Bishop of Kabale on March 9 at Rushhorozi Cathedral here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 69-year-old Bishop was the Superior-General of the White Fathers in Rome for six years. He is described as &quot;a very friendly person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers say by appointing an expatriate to take over the troubled diocese, the Catholic Church has handled the matter well. This approach helps discourage internal wrangles and dissensions within the ranks of the Catholic Church in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is where the Anglican in Uganda can learn from the Catholics since similar dissensions have led to serious troubles in the Diocese of Busoga with further trouble looming in the Diocese of West Ankole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Busoga Diocese, the House of Bishops decided to send Bishop Cyprian Bamwoze on sabbatical leave for a second time in one year, but he defied the ruling and has continued with his duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Bamwoze is supported by the Diocesan Council of Busoga who also turned down a reconciliatory prayer service by Archbishop Livingstone Nkoyoyo late January.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - The Israeli Ministry of Health will make only minor changes to its policy regarding blood donations from Ethiopian Jewish immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Israeli Minister of Health Dr. Ephraim Sneth, convened the Advisory Council on Immuno-hematology and Blood, on January 25 in the aftermath of the Israeli Blood Bank scandal in which blood donations from Ethiopian Jewish immigrants were found to have been routinely destroyed (according to the Israeli newspaper, Maariv).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scandal led to an uproar by thousands of Ethiopian Jews who stormed the office of Prime Minister Shimon Peres, in Jerusalem, on January 28. The Prime Minister defused the situation when he said publicly that he understood their anger.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Israeli Ministry of Health intends to pursue the existing policy but promised to re-evaluate it in the course of the year. The Advisory Council stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - The current policy prohibiting the use of blood donations is correct and necessary for the protection of Public Health;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - The questionnaire, which is filled out by every blood donor will from now on clearly state that the use of blood taken from donors is dependent upon medical considerations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - The Blood Banks will continue to check Ethiopian donors for rare blood types; those donations found to contain these blood types will continue to be used as they are today;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - All members of the Ethiopian community will now receive Blood Bank insurance automatically (this means in case of a mistake by the Transfusion Service, they will be compensated automatically);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Regarding the claim that there are techniques available for &quot;heating of blood&quot; in order to destroy viruses which may be found in the blood of &quot;high risk&quot; donors - these techniques contravene the international conventions to which Israel is signatory and they will not adequately protect the Public Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result of the anger demonstrated by the Ethiopian community in Israel and the commotion that followed outside the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem, on January 28, at least 16 demonstrators were taken to hospital.  The police claim a number of them were injured &quot;by rocks and other objects thrown by individuals in the crowd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police gave their own figures as 41 injured. One police officer was struck by a rock that paralysed him from the waist down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of observers believe the blood scandal was a blessing in disguise for the Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel who have faced a number of social-cultural obstacles since they were airlifted to Israel in large numbers from 1985 to 1991. Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Mrs Peres paid tribute to the Ethiopian community in Israel saying they are a humble peace loving people who had been provoked beyond restraint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - In early 1993, the presence of the female condom was confirmed in Kenya. Although the device was then meant for display purposes only, a study about its acceptability among women in Kenya has begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controversial female condom, available in Europe and North America since 1990, has found its way into Kenya. However it will not be accessible to the ordinary consumer until after June, pending findings of research being carried out about its acceptability.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesperson of Family Health International (FHI) declined to comment on the condom saying that publicity was undesirable at this stage of the research work as it would probably rally groups traditionally opposed to the use of the condom against the research process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The research is reportedly sponsored by Family Health International through its Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Control and Prevention project, AIDSCAP. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), on the other hand, is said to be &quot;making available a small number of female condoms for research.&quot; On the ground is the Centre for Gender Training and Development, a local non-governmental organisation which is doing the ground work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scientists and health workers view the condom as a long-term strategy to provide women with more control over sexual behaviour and in decisions related to their own health. The World Health Organisation (WHO) projections indicate that between 30 to 40 million people will have been infected by the human immuno- deficiency virus (HIV) by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current study, said to be also investigating women's perception of the female condom as a protective method against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, has already met the wrath of the Catholic church. The Catholic Secretariat's Family Life National Co-ordinator, Mrs. Angeline Kyonda, says that &quot;condoms, whether for men or women are unacceptable (by the Catholic church) for they are not 100 per cent perfect and yet give the false impression as a prevention against AIDS. If we are working for the welfare of Kenyans and not manufacturers, we would promote and emphasize on the best way of avoiding AIDS and STDs according to the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO),&quot; Mrs Kyonda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She highlighted these recommendations as fidelity within marriage and chastity before marriage. &quot;Let us tell people the truth about the shortcomings of the condom and let them make informed judgement,&quot; Mrs Kyonda added. She wondered whether the female condom will make a difference as a family planning device where, the male condom has shown failure rate of over 20 per cent among married couples and an even higher rate among teenagers when used as a device against pregnancy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Kyonda lamented that Kenyans were in the habit of unquestioningly embracing values and devices that eroded their morals and dignity. &quot;Whereas we are tightening the noose around such vices as stealing, why are we promoting fornication and promiscuity through the promotion of condoms?&quot; she asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, a participant in the ongoing research told this writer she was glad she now had a means of protecting herself against AIDS and other STDs too. &quot;The male condom favours men, why shouldn't women too have a device meant for them?&quot; she wondered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya will not be the first African country in which this kind of study has been carried out. An acceptability study of the female condom was carried out in Zimbabwe last year among sex workers, urban women attending a family planning clinic in the capital Harare and volunteer Zimbabwean rural women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the May 1995 edition of Reproductive Health Matters, a bi-annual magazine whose motto is &quot;Promoting Safer Sex&quot;, over 50 per cent of women in all the three groups &quot;said that they and their partners liked the condom very much and preferred it to the male condom.&quot; However, the publication adds, these positive responses were male-centred. The report adds that less than 10 per cent of the participants in the study said they did not like the female condom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main problems associated with the female condom in the Zimbabwe study were reportedly discomfort arising from the inner ring. Questions of sustainability and the cost of this device were also raised by the study in view of potential obstacles to the use of the female condom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The female condom is a 17-centimetre long polyurethane tube with an outer ring meant to anchor outside and an inner ring designed to rest around the cervix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already, doubts are being raised about the effectiveness of this device both as a family planning method and means of protection against STDs and AIDS. Its predecessor, the male condom, has had a failure rate of &quot;upwards of 20 per cent, both as a family planning device and a prevention against sexually transmitted diseases,&quot; according to a Nairobi gynaecologist who requested anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Reproductive Health Matters reports that female condoms are made of polyurethane plastic, that is sturdier than the latex used in male condoms potentially offering &quot;greater protection and less frequent breakage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recently developed female condom which is not widely available outside Europe and North America, is reportedly meant to be one more step in the process of empowering women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Fredrick Kibaki of the (Anglican) Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) says, &quot;as long as it is used by married couples, then there is no problem about it.&quot; He too expressed fear that the condoms might eventually fall in the hands of teenagers, encouraging immorality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rosemary Akinyi, a married woman living in Nairobi says of the female condom; &quot;People should look at it objectively. They should weigh its benefits against its disadvantages. And I think they will find the device liberating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However Jane Kariuki, a business woman in Nairobi's Westlands region when asked about the future place of the female condom in Kenya retorted curtly; &quot;I won't touch it and I won't talk about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Standing as major obstacles to the future of the condom in Kenya are not only social and cultural factors but also established institutions such as the Church. These, however, will have to face up to individual decisions which will finally make or break the future of the female condom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, the biggest barrier to its accessibility among poor developing countries is said to be its cost. Going at the prohibitive price of US dollars 2.50 (Kenya shillings 140) each in the United States, the female condom is well beyond the average Kenyan's purchasing power. What this boils down to is that a Kenyan user would have to use the average per capita income of shs 14,300 in 1994 (US dollars 260) to buy only 100 female condoms.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The media fraternity in Kenya early February experienced a rare show of unity, as local journalists hosted Attorney-General Amos Wako, whom they accused of drafting Bills for legislation by Parliament, threatening the &quot;existence of our profession, our source of livelihood and our only source of bread and butter,&quot; according to George Odiko, Secretary-General of the Kenya Union of Journalists (KUJ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening the February 6 to 7 Press Council of Kenya and the Kenya Mass Media Commission Bills media workshop, organised to discuss the implications of recently introduced media bills, Attorney- General Amos Wako said; &quot;there is no cause for alarm over the proposed laws as they are merely the draft initial working documents and are yet to become Bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the workshop, the chief government legal adviser assured the press that the government was committed to &quot;upholding the freedom of the press as enshrined in the Constitution.&quot; However, he maintained the position that every profession must have a system of registration, a code of conduct and an enforcement machinery which should be self-regulatory.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This &quot;tactical retreat,&quot; as the participants termed Wako's reassurance, did little to mollify the enraged journalists who included editors of the country's leading newspapers, foreign correspondents, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting representatives, lecturers and students from the University of Nairobi's School of Journalism, lawyers and observers from non- governmental organisations (NGOs). The workshop was jointly organised by the KUJ, the Kenya Professional Journalists Association (KEPJA) and the African Council for Communication Education (ACCE)-Kenya Chapter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What do the offending bills say? They provide for the creation of the Kenya Mass Media Commission to regulate the operations of the mass media and the establishment of the Press Council of Kenya for the registration of journalists and mass media. The task of the Commission will be to maintain a register of all newspapers printed and published in the country, to license all broadcasting services, to issue broadcasting licenses - in short to act as a watchdog for the people's watchdog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The composition of the Commission raises concern over its independence from government control. Journalists view as sinister the presidential appointment of its chairman, who in turn is to appoint eight members out of a panel of 13 to enforce a new code of conduct that journalists must comply with or face individual de- registration or that of their newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, the Council Bill's section 5(e) states that its functions will be to register and maintain a register of all practising journalists in Kenya. In practice, one would have to prove that he or she is of &quot;good moral conduct&quot; before being issued with a license - but does not define what this conduct entails, say the journalists. The Bill requires journalists to renew their licenses every year and confers the power to withdraw licenses to the Council if somebody complains of being aggrieved by a story. &quot;This will scare away potential investors and it means a journalist will only be professional for only one year before going for renewal of the license,&quot; a worried KUJ Secretary-General told participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another fear expressed by most journalists at the workshop is that most of the members of the Fourth Estate in Kenya are not college- trained but have learnt what they do on the job. The bills require that to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> be a registered journalist, one must have undergone a prescribed form of training locally or in a country recognized by the press council.  Participants also argued that cartoonists, photographers and special correspondents, especially those who write on health or legal matters will be done away with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ambiguity inherent in the Bills can best be viewed in the stipulation that a newspaper is defined as any magazine or any printed matter that &quot;contains news, or intelligence, or occurrences, of interest to the public, or any views, comments, or observations printed for sale or distribution and published periodically or at intervals not exceeding three months,&quot; only excluding business cards or letter-heads and brochures. The above mentioned observation, by Constitutional lawyer Prof Kivutha Kibwana of the University of Nairobi, elicited mirth among the participants. He termed the bills draconian saying, they &quot;resemble the gagging of the press under Adolf Hitler's information act and apartheid laws formerly imposed in South Africa.&quot; He stated that the intended legislation was unconstitutional and in contravention of Section 79 which guarantees the freedom of expression to all Kenyans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The news of the intended legislation was first reported in the independent weekly, Economic Review magazine on January 15, under the headline: Killing The Press. The initial government reaction to the press publicity and public reaction that ensued was to deny the existence of such drafts, through Attorney-General Amos Wako.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faced with this pressure, the government finally buckled when on arrival from an East African Cooperation summit meeting in neighbouring Uganda, President Moi directed the Attorney-General to shelve the Bills until the matter was fully discussed by all concerned. This action let off a sigh of relief among media houses and set the ball rolling to hold a workshop to discuss among other things, the possibility of drawing up their own Bill to contain what journalists feel is relevant for their profession and explore channels of formalising a strong front which has sorely lacked among them upto now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Minister for Information and Broadcasting Johnstone Makau, had earlier dismissed the role of a task force appointed by the Attorney-General to look into the issue of reviewing press laws in 1994, saying: &quot;The force is a waste of time and the government will not consider its recommendations.&quot; This had angered the members of the task force, made up of eminent media personalities, editors of all leading newspapers, book publishers and lawyers. Some had threatened to quit at the time but were prevailed upon by the A-G to stay on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the dust had hardly settled after the press workshop than Hilary Ng'weno, Chairman of the Task Force resigned, citing personal reasons.  Mr. Horace Awori former chairman of the Foreign Correspondents Association replaced him. Resolutions from the workshop include calls on the A-G to broaden the composition of the Task Force to include some representatives from the newly formed KEPJA and the editors of opposition newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The journalists also requested that at least two representatives from the workshop's organising committee be accommodated, called for the publicizing of the names of its members and removing the requirement that members be sworn to secrecy while on the Force. The final consensus was to form a Task Force of their own which will review the existing press laws, with a view to having them incorporated in a media bill which a committee was mandated to start working on, to be forwarded to the Attorney-General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Calling on the participants to not only reject the proposed Bills but also come up with a draft Bill of their own, a former managing editor of Kenya's mass circulation daily, the Daily Nation, Mr. Joe Kadhi said: &quot;Freedom of the press is of little meaning if it does not include freedom of information where all kinds of pretexts like bureaucracy makes certain files, information or interviews with officials inaccessible to journalists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question journalists kept asking themselves is whether the current laws are adequate or as has happened in the past, -- is the government out to harness the press now that general elections are to be held in 1997?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How is the average Kenyan going to be affected if these drafts become law? The media fraternity are unanimous that press freedom will be eroded and the diversity of opinion, especially from the opposition politicians and others critical of the government, will be a thing of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A survey of the media scene in Kenya reveals that of the three main daily newspapers with a national audience, only one is independently owned, the other is the ruling party's mouthpiece and the third was recently sold by the British conglomerate Lonrho, to &quot;international investors&quot;, suspected by media observers, to be linked to the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party. The two broadcasting stations, Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) and Kenya Television Network (KTN) are government-controlled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only one national radio operates in the country run by the KBC. However, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, which has refused to license several other private radio and television stations numbering more than 60, this month awarded a radio license to Kanu official Mark Too whose application was reportedly not on the waiting list of potential licensees and his company, Capital FM is said not to have been incorporated at the time of being given access to the airwave frequency. Too is also the Chairman of the East African Standard newspapers, recently sold by Lonrho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mass Media Commission Bill exempts the KBC and government-owned newspapers from certain restrictions which it seeks to impose on privately owned media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These laws, journalists say, are punitive to private investors as some seek to curtail the commercial viability of running a station without advertisers and present broadcasters with a threat of having their licenses revoked after eight years - meaning the high costs of establishing a station could be lost. KBC is not required to comply with these provisions hence the competition is unfairly skewed in its favour, say journalists. They add that in this case the public would lose out on its right to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Retired judge William Mbaya termed the Bills unconstitutional and accused the government of making a habit of legislating bills that are ultra vires the Constitution on several occasions in post- independent Kenya. He told participants at the seminar to come out strongly against the draft Bills because once they become laws, even the courts cannot intervene to remedy the crisis. &quot;A court can only declare a statute unconstitutional but cannot repeal it, until Parliament does so,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other countries that have similar laws on the media in Africa include Nigeria, enacted in 1989 and again in 1992 via a decree, Ghana, since 1987, Sierra Leone and Uganda in 1995. All these governments have one thing in common - they are military regimes that have not been elected into office through the ballot, and just like Hitler's Germany and Stalinist Russia, they survive in power by keeping dissenting views under tight control.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Another upheaval awaits Rwandese refugees in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, following Zaire's clear intentions to forcefully evict the refugee population who have lived in eastern Zaire for nearly two years. Tanzania and Burundi are equally insisting that the Rwandese must leave &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between April and August 1994 more than 2 million people from the majority Hutu tribe fled Rwanda at the peak of the civil war that eventually brought Tutsi dominated Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least one million minority Tutsis lost their lives in the genocide perpetrated by extremist militias and the Hutu dominated army who fled into neighbouring lands fearing revenge from the victorious RPF. The Rwandese fled into Zaire and Tanzania with a smaller number going to Burundi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But now the authorities in Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi want the Rwandese to return home and are making that clear in very strong terms indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is expected that a mass movement of people could erupt again in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, if Zaire should decide to implement too vigorously, its plan to force an estimated one million Rwandese in Eastern Zaire to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On February 8, Zaire's Interior Minister Gustave Mulumba Mbangula made it clear the Rwandese in the Goma area of Zaire had overstayed their welcome.  He declared: &quot;We will close the Kibumba camp. When that camp is empty, we will proceed to another, one by one, until all refugees have gone back to Rwanda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Tanzania, the authorities have issued a series of statements emphasising the need for the Rwandese to return home &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Tanzania which is Rwanda's neighbour to the east has 700,000 refugees in its camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On February 12, Tanzania's Interior Ministry issued a decree banning the activities of the Rally for the Return of Democracy, a Hutu organisation cum lobby group, that has been active in Ngara refugee camp in north-western Tanzania. The authorities also announced the arrest of 160 Rally supporters who have been active in dissuading refugees from returning to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Hutu extremists fear that once the refugees return home, they will no longer have a power base. Moreover the extremists know they are wanted worldwide for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. They are alarmed and desperate as the tide turns against them in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Zaire, the authorities have with effect from February 13, surrounded the camp at Kibumba with troops to ensure the refugees do not flee into the hills and the countryside around Goma in Eastern Zaire, as happened last August when Zaire first tried to evict the refugees from the camps operated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Zaireans are likely to act contrary to their assurances to the UNHCR on August 7, that Zairean troops would not enter the camps. They promised to use persuasion instead of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Rwanda's Vice-President and Defence Minister, Paul Kagame, said his men had intercepted radio messages by the Zaireans, saying Kibumba camp and another camp in Bukavu would be besieged by gendarmerie as a prelude to the forceful eviction of the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hutu extremists and soldiers who have been training in camps housing military men in eastern Zaire with a view to invading Rwanda, appear to have received similar information regarding Zaire's true intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Around February 10, hundreds of these former soldiers slipped out of their camps and fled deeper into the interior, where it will be difficult for the Zairean army to flush them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the process, these marauders displaced hundreds of Tutsis who had settled in the Masisi area of Kivu Province, about 90 kilometres from the border with Rwanda. The affected Tutsis have lived in Zaire for more than a generation, having been displaced from Rwanda in the upheavals of the late 50s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire has acted in an ambivalent way in regard to the Rwanda tragedy and has turned a blind eye to the activities of these extremists. In fact, a United Nations mission to verify the activities of the extremists in the camps last January was denied assistance by the Zaireans and the mission returned to New York with no solid report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Civilian Rwandese refugees living in the Goma camps retain fresh memories of what happened last August, when Zairean troops descended on their camps and forcibly bundled anybody they could grab onto lorries, subsequently dumping them at the border. Families were suddenly separated and, Zairean troops described as &quot;ruthlessly efficient&quot; - were accused of looting refugees' property in the confusion that followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of refugees broke away and fled into the hills and countryside around Kibumba and other camps. The whole operation only came to a halt after an international uproar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By September 1995, over 16,000 refugees were back in Rwanda, forcefully evicted. After screening, many were allowed to return to their communes, but a few suspected genocide participants ended up in dangerously overcrowded prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to restore a semblance of &quot;dignity and security&quot; to the eviction process, Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, agreed with President Mobutu Sese Seko on a planned approach to the whole process.  This would comprise a daily return rate of 5,000 to 10,000 refugees. The UNHCR did not tell the world that its funds for Rwanda refugees - who require US dollars 1 million each day, had dried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fernado del Mundo of UNHCR in Geneva, admitted at the beginning of February that the agency's Rwanda funds had been depleted with only US dollars 20 million left in the kitty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi's Tutsi dominated army have already forcefully closed down a number of Rwandese refugee camps on Burundi territory. At least 10,000 people from the Ntamba and Mugano camps chose to return home to Rwanda after Tanzanian authorities initially barred them from entering Tanzania territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On a visit to Ngara camp in Tanzania on February 9, the Rwandese Prime Minister Felicien Rwigyema, a Hutu, appears to have succeeded in convincing many more refugees that returning home is the best option for them. Tanzania has consistently pleaded poverty and urged the refugees to go home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All in all it looks like most Rwandese refugees would be back on the road to Rwanda in the next six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They return home to an uncertain future. The Rwandese authorities have refused to declare a general amnesty. Those suspected of involvement in the genocide of 1994 will end up in prisons that are overcrowded with a high inmate death rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, the Hutus, cannot be sure that returnee Tutsis whose families fled into exile in the late 50s, do not occupy their home and land already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is clear that Rwanda's humanitarian upheaval will continue for some time to come. However, Jane Matheson of British charity, Oxfam in Kigali, is optimistic that Rwanda has done better than she is generally credited with.  Matheson points out what is generally little known, that one million refugees have returned home quietly on their own over the last 12 months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria - &quot;The South African High Commissioner, H.E. Mr G.S. Nene, returned to Lagos on 11 February 1996, exactly three months since he was recalled by President Nelson Mandela for consultations in protest of the Nigeria government's summary executive of MOSOP leader Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Government has condemned in the strongest possible terms these executions which were carried out despite appeals for clemency by various governments, including Pres. Mandela himself. In addition, the South African Government wishes to express concern over the continued detention of former President Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, the presumed winner of the annulled 1993 presidential elections Chief M.K.O. Abiola, and a host of other political detainees and pro-democracy activists, including those suspected of involvement in the alleged coup plot of 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without attempting to interfere with the due process of law in Nigeria, the South African Government expresses the hope that these detainees will be given unhindered access to legal counsel and their families. At the same time the South African Government appeals for the immediate release of all political prisoners where applicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In resuming his duties as High Commissioner to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, H.E. Mr G.S. Nene will continue to promote bilateral relations between the two countries. As an emerging democracy, South Africa is ready to fulfill its role in promoting the well-being of the entire African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recent upsurge in political uncertainty and instability which gripped several West African nations since the start of 1996, is highly regrettable. The South Africa Government therefore once again appeals to all those concerned, to join in the international community's march towards global democracy and the universal respect for all basic and fundamental human rights. In view of the strategic role that Nigeria fulfills in West Africa it also carries the responsibility to act as a model to be emulated by its neighbours. The South African Government accordingly welcomes the process of democratisation upon which the military government of Nigeria has embarked and expresses the hope that this process well continue unabated and without undue delays. South Africa will remain supportive of Nigerians' quest for a democratically elected government, representative of all its peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Government furthermore wishes to deny recent allegations by certain sources inside Nigeria as to South Africa's alleged support of Nigerian pro-democracy groups in order to &quot;destabilise&quot; the country. These reports are baseless and are not in the interest of expanding relations between both our countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Government does, however, wish to reiterate its unequivocal support for all efforts to promote the growth of democracy everywhere in the world. This would also include listening and consulting with all parties representative of the Nigerian political spectrum. As part and parcel of these efforts no political leaders or groups inside or out of Nigeria would be denied a hearing by the South African Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the South African Government will continue to forge its foreign policy on Nigeria in consultation with other Commonwealth governments, as was agreed at the most recent GHOGM meeting in Auckland.  South Africa, together with seven other Commonwealth governments, will monitor the situation in Nigeria and will formulate its foreign policy regarding Nigeria within this framework, as well as in consultation with the member states of the Organisation for African Unity (OAU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Government accordingly regrets the Federal Government's rejection of the CMAG initiative which effectively denies Nigeria the opportunity to present its case to the Commonwealth of nations.  Together with the other CMAG members, South Africa therefore wishes to reiterate its appeal to Nigeria to reconsider its denial and access to the CMAG delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Government, cognisant of the important role that sport has played in the process of bringing about peace and reconciliation amongst its citizens, again expresses its regret at the absence of the Nigerian &quot;Super Eagles&quot; football team from the most recent Africa Cup tournament. It is hoped that Nigerian sportsmen and women will in future be granted the opportunity by the Nigerian government to participate in international events.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Geneva - Acting on a request from the Government of Gabon, an international team of medical experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), Gabon and France has arrived in a remote village in northern Gabon to investigate an outbreak of suspected Ebola haemorrhagic fever which has killed 10 people and infected at least nine others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All 19 persons are from the village of Mayibout, located on the Ivindo River in a sparsely populated area about 150 kilometers from Makokou, the provincial capital of Ogooue-Ivindo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The patients were admitted to the provincial hospital in Makokou on 5 and 6 February exhibiting symptoms of high fever, bloody diarrhoea and severely reddened eyes. The nine survivors have been isolated as a measure to prevent further spread of infection, and appear to be recovering.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Preliminary laboratory results on blood specimens which were taken from nine of the patients support the initial diagnosis of Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Confirmatory tests are currently underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the 19 cases admitted to the hospital in Makokou, four other persons are under surveillance in Mayibout for possible infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The initial source of transmission for the outbreak is reported to have been contact by the patients with a chimpanzee on 26 January. The circumstances are being investigated by the medical team, which is seeking to identify other persons who may have had contact either with the chimpanzee or with the Ebola victims and to institute appropriate infection control measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If confirmed, the outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Gabon will mark the second appearance of the disease on the African continent since the epidemic in Zaire in 1995 which infected 316 people and killed 245, a 77% fatality rate. A single case of Ebola was confirmed in Cote d'Ivoire in December. The patient survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHO is leading an international collaborative 2-year study project in the Tai Forest of C=F4te d'Ivoire aimed at identifying the natural host reservoir of the Ebola virus, which is the key to identifying its mode of transmission. This would help predict when and where Ebola outbreaks are most likely to occur and what behaviour modifications could prevent infection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - In ordinary East African lingua franca, it is known as &quot;chai&quot; (tea) or &quot;kitu kidogo&quot; (something small) but that is underplaying the magnitude of corruption which has obstructed the normal functioning of the social systems in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past, corruption used to be automatically connected with regimes in Africa and other under-developed regions but of late, European businessmen, politicians and bank officials have been mentioned in related cases. Corruption is not a monopoly of developing countries, be they in Africa, America or Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's Inspector General of Government (IGG), Mr. Augustine Ruzindana, says &quot;corruption which for a long time has been known as a very important channel for business contacts and deals between transnationals and leaders in the Third World, has to the dismay and despair of everyone involved in fighting corruption, been discovered to be quite common in the First World too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A global phenomenon, corruption is perhaps as old as humanity. It is not a structural characteristic of any country or society. The interest which the World Bank and other multilateral institutions are beginning to show in the practice is therefore timely, as it will perhaps go a long way in attracting due emphasis in understanding and combating this problem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the time of independence in 1962, Uganda had a very promising future. At that time, the country was fighting three main enemies namely poverty, ignorance and disease. Today, one can add corruption and repression to the same list. Unfortunately, the new additions complicate the prevailing situation because they interfere with production and distribution of goods and services at all levels in all sectors of the economy,&quot; says Ruzindana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Corruption is also an impediment to democracy because it subverts the democratic process of elections, of government administration, law enforcement and the legal process. It results in moral decay such that a practitioner of it whether one is a policeman, politician, civil servant or churchman loses a sense of values. Corruption saps the whole social fabric of a nation to the extent that it can be regarded as an inevitable way of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since independence, with the political upheavals we have had in Uganda, job insecurity became a major cause of corruption. Senior public servants suddenly had to maximise their earnings when they could since they were not sure how long they would stay in office,&quot; says Ruzindana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Uganda particularly and Africa in general, political leadership is always a transitory period which contributes a great deal to the practice of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is a great deal of insecurity at individual and systematic levels. This leads to official looting with the hope that when the inevitable happens, those stealing will have some accumulated savings to cushion their lives in exile,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another factor which has encouraged corruption is retrenchment. &quot;Every now and then, the relevant ministers announce a reduction in the number of civil servants or soldiers. Since 'victims' are never identified, everyone feels the need to save for the expected lay-off and the level of corruption therefore increases,&quot; he notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Africa, virtually every change of government, whether violent or peaceful, is on the platform of getting rid of corrupt officers. These changes are always followed by commissions of inquiry or tribunals, sometimes with extensive powers to combat corruption, but the malpractice still persists and seems to defy all measures put in place against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We may, therefore, be tempted to conclude that perhaps we have not yet made a correct diagnosis of the problem or that the correct methods to deal with corruption have not yet been found or that maybe only half hearted measures are taken against corruption without the will to go all out and fight it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another conclusion that could be made is that perhaps the standards and values are largely still those of pre-industrial societies. Whatever answers are available for these questions, most people agree, perhaps with the exception of the beneficiaries of corruption, that corruption is an evil that must be combated in all societies,&quot; says Ruzindana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ruzindana highlights the following types of corruption which are common in Uganda: bribes, extortion, illegal use of public assets for private gain, over and under-invoicing, paying salaries to non- existing workers, paying for services not rendered (air supply), under-charging of taxes and duties as exports and imports involving false classifications, false tariffs, 10 per cent commission, fraud and embezzlement, misappropriation of assets, court decisions in which award for damages of very large sums of money do not correspond to the injury actually suffered and &quot;loss&quot; of court files.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neglect or negligence of duty could also be classified as corruption since one is paid for &quot;no work done&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, what is considered as corruption in Africa may not be considered corruption in the developed countries. Also, types which are considered important in the developed countries may not be significant in Africa. Money laundering, drug trafficking and organised crime are now making hot news in some African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's IGG says; &quot;All these forms of corruption mentioned may have different causes. But the main conditions that provide a permissive environment for corruption to occur are often lack of a properly institutionalised system with the necessary control mechanism. Sometimes the wholesale breakdown of the entire system is the main cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He notes that in such cases, a feeling of immunity characterises the system, so that politicians and civil servants think that they can do anything without any adverse repercussions against the culprits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the effects of corruption in Africa, Ruzindana observes that it has eaten up national, social and economic progress and to some extent even political progress has been impaired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Corruption involves the transfer of public resources, services and assets from public to private use. The diversion sometimes entails transferring funds to foreign countries thus causing harmful effects on economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Ruzindana; &quot;Corruption is coupled with outright economic and political instability and gross abuse of power. To be more specific, corruption has led to bad roads, poor medical services, poor schools, falling educational standards, disappearance of whole projects which have been funded and delayed completion of projects. Foreign aid has disappeared without leaving a trace of what was done with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Repairs of buildings and equipment, vehicles and roads were paid for but never carried out, goods paid for several times were never delivered and the 10 per cent became mandatory inorder to win tenders and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contracts. All this resulted in poor terms and conditions of services for all workers in Uganda, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The sum total of all these accumulated losses in every area of public expenditure is colossal economic destruction. The majority of the population is adversely affected by corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Africa is to realise progress at a faster pace, corruption must be eliminated outright,&quot; says Ruzindana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda has openly acknowledged corruption as a major problem, hence the formation of the office of the IGG to investigate corruption on a permanent basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IGG is charged with the duty of eliminating and fostering the elimination of corruption and abuse of public offices by taking necessary measures for the detection and prevention of corruption in public offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IGG investigates the conduct of any public office which may be connected with or conducive to the following: the abuse of office or authority; the neglect of official duties and economic malpractices by the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since its inception in 1986, the IGG's office has been vigilant in curbing corruption but in most cases, advice given is ignored by those in authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The existing freedom of the press has given the Ugandan journalists a field day because corrupt officials are exposed to the public through the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Notes Ruzindana; &quot;Accountability and transparency within public administration are gradually being established even though corruption persists as a major problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However he warns; &quot;If the political leadership tolerates or encourages corruption by not punishing those who are corrupt within its own group, then corruption becomes uncontrollable. Corruption cannot exist without the connivance of the political leadership even if passive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Corruption introduces discrimination and arbitrariness in decision making so that rules, regulations and procedures become less important.  Corruption can only be eliminated when both the political leadership and the public make a concerted effort not to tolerate the practice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Nairobi - A middle-aged woman, weighed down by the load of firewood strapped onto her back, trudges along a dusty rural footpath. But the firewood is only part of her day's luggage. With it goes a basket full of vegetables, as her baby sleeps or chuckles to himself from his position -- strapped on her stomach. A girl of about nine years walks ahead of the woman.  She too carries a heavy load of firewood. It is towards evening hours, yet it is still hot. A few paces behind them, a man carrying a hoe in one hand, walks leisurely, puffing away at his home-made cigarette. The family has been working on their shamba some six kilometres away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On getting home, the woman goes to the kitchen to prepare the family's evening meal while her husband rests under a mango tree in the compound.  After the meal, the man asks for water to bathe but the little water left in the house is not enough.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wife picks a jerrican and rushes to fetch water at the river, some two kilometres away. After taking his bath, the man walks to the nearby shopping centre to while away the evening. Meantime, his wife at home prepares to milk their only cow among a host of other evening chores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a recently published United Nations report on women in Africa; &quot;35 per cent of all African households are supported by women, for whom much of the daily work is without remuneration and the value of their household labour goes unrecorded.&quot; Further, the rural African women, usually poverty-stricken, form the larger part of this percentage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of late, there has been an upbeat in addressing issues adversely affecting women and formulating strategies to alleviate them. To date, four UN-supported world conferences on women have taken place - - Mexico City (1975), Copenhagen, Denmark (1980), Nairobi, Kenya (1985), and the just concluded Beijing, China conference held between August 20 and September 15, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although mostly affected by issues discussed in such meetings, the rural suffering women in Africa are hardly included in delegations to these conferences. For instance, one East African delegation to Beijing comprised of well-off mostly urban women. A survey conducted by a local daily just before the meeting showed that nearly 70 per cent of that country's rural women were not aware of the conference in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equally unfortunate, although pertinent, strategies adopted on issues affecting women in Africa such as economic empowerment and poverty reduction, violence against women, sexual harassment, women in education and training, the girl-child, and women political empowerment and decision making are not communicated to the rural women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Africa, the church is well placed to enlighten women on issues affecting them in order to improve their social, political and economic status in a changing world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During a Mothers' Union conference held in Kenya's Western Province in the Butere Diocese of the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) late last year, over 100 rural women leaders freely and courageously expressed their views on issues affecting them. Most speakers complained of harassment and hard work meted out to them by their husbands and other men in society. Guest speakers, who were drawn from among well known women leaders, advised the mothers on new developments in the struggle for women empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Women had taken the church as a comforter and nothing else,&quot; said Dr.  Musimbi Kanyoro, who is the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) Secretary for the Office for Women in Church and Society. She noted that it is time women in rural areas shed the dark ages of inferiority complex and regard themselves as people with a say in society. &quot;Women in rural areas have remained in the dark, thereby paving way for oppression by their husbands out of their ignorance and fear,&quot; she observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Kanyoro said the church programme on women issues is working on strategies to change some structures in society so that women can get involved in matters that affect them without any form of gender discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A representative of the CPK Development Office, Ann Wachira, challenged members of the Mothers' Union to be self starters; &quot;Do things out of your will and anxiety. Do not wait to be told what to do always......&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Maendeleo ya Wanawake (Women in Progress) - a national women's body - chairlady in Butere division advised the mothers to avoid idleness by forming self-help women's groups as these will help remove financial stress causing quarrels in some homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Horace Etemesi of the CPK Butere Diocese, in a concluding note, told the mothers to stop living under threats and harassment as the church and the state recognised them (women), adding, they should seek assistance from church elders without hesitation and where the matter is serious, let the relevant authority deal with such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other mainstream churches represented included the Catholic Church through the Catholic Women Association (CWA); the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA), through Women's Guild, African Inland Churches (AICs) and Lutheran churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, as awareness about issues affecting women grows, there is a need to caution women in Africa about the dangers of radical feminism. For instance, in the United States the feminist movement, now dubbed &quot;movement gone wrong&quot; by critics, is misleading women in their agitation for equal rights and opportunities. Critics say the movement has strayed from its primary purpose which spelt out the need for women to make a contribution in society commensurate with the individual's talents and energies. Instead of empowering women, they have actually &quot;created a victim mentality that debilitates them,&quot; some argue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Radical feminism presents itself as a source of ultimate meaning for women. It claims to answer the basic theological question, why women suffer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For many women, the radical movements have become a religion in America,&quot; reported the June 1994 edition of Christianity Today magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lady American lawyer reports in Christianity Today; &quot;If we gain a new insight - that men and women are equals, only to loose sight of the timeless truth about being truly whole in Christ we make a bad bargain indeed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - 'They Are A Target' is a book about 200 African priests killed in the course of their service to God and mankind over the last 40 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The author, an expatriate Comboni missionary and journalist, tells the story of African priests who paid with their lives due to political, tribal, religious and social intolerance in their nations. The book covers 16 African nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through the 207-page book, Father Neno Contran recalls the memory of otherwise forgotten padres, many of whom met their deaths under pressure of duty - serving a sick person, defending women, children and Africa's perennially vulnerable refugees. Sadly indeed, some died because an intoxicated bandit or soldier turned up at the door one nightfall and blasted away with an AK47.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some were shot while many more were simply hacked to death in the most gruesome manner imaginable. Father Contran does not conceal the details, even when the body of one murdered Luba (Zaire) priest is abused after murder.  'They Are A Target' is not just a book listing dead padres. It is also a good historical text that contextualises the death of many clergy and in the process reveals Africa's deeper weaknesses, particularly tribalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The blood of these priests fell onto the African soil, in the furrow of the Holy Sacrifice of Christ,&quot; says Bernadin Cardinal Gantin of Benin who wrote the foreword to this book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cardinal Gantin says the book has helped redress an imbalance in the coverage of the heroism and sacrifices of indigenous African padres whose death rarely elicits coverage by Western media. &quot;The mass media usually run a feature on an expatriate missionary killed in some corner of the continent but tend to ignore the killing of an African priest,&quot; laments Gantin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reader will be quick to notice - as Cardinal Gantin did - the striking similarity of circumstances in which the priests perished, whether in Sudan, Mozambique, Uganda, Rwanda or Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> History tends to repeat itself and the same pattern of ideology and tyrannical intolerance emerges and may emerge again. Some countries, like Malawi, do not have a single priest listed in this book, but one should keep in mind that official intolerance nearly cost the lives of Malawi's Bishops after the publication of their Pastoral Letter in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One may be forgiven for thinking the book is about the senseless slaughter of several dozen padres that took place in Rwanda between April and July 1994, following the death of that country's and neighbouring Burundi's Presidents in a suspicious plane crash on April 6. Ethnic massacres sparked by the incident left between 500,000 and one million Rwandese dead, and about two million fleeing into neighbouring countries, while more hundreds of thousands were displaced inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> True, the Rwanda holocaust cost the lives of one Archbishop, two bishops, 96 priests, 64 Sisters, 45 Brothers and 28 lay consecrated persons but the book covers as many priests from elsewhere in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is most disturbing is the premeditation that precedes the murder of many priests listed in 'They Are A Target'. In Sudan and Zaire during the Simba insurgency of the mid-sixties and Uganda during the regime of Idi Amin and later Rwanda in the holocaust of 1994, the killers methodically set out to injure and kill priests and bishops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The highest ranking servant of the church who lost his life to the intrigues of tyrannical people was Emille Cardinal Baiyenda, the Archbishop of Brazaville, Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cardinal Baiyenda aged 50 years, Africa's youngest Cardinal - was kidnapped on the evening of March 22, 1977, and murdered during the same night. Sadly, he had ignored persistent rumours that he was next in line to be killed, after the assassination of President Marien Nguabi (Congo) on March 18, 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On that fateful evening, a Land-rover pulled up in front of the Cardinal's residence, two people alighted and told the Cardinal that the members of the Military Council that had seized power, wanted to see him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps only time will tell why Cardinal Baiyenda so unsuspiciously boarded the vehicle to his death. Although former President Massamba Debat was later executed for this &quot;heinous act&quot; he may have been a mere scapegoat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pope described the loss as &quot;a harsh blood toll paid by the church in the person of one of the most worthy men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many readers of this book will shed tears because of the senseless and brutal manner in which many of the priests were killed. One such was a Ugandan padre, Father Clement Kiggundu, editor of the Catholic newspaper, Munno.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Archbishop of Kampala, E.K. Nsubuga, told mourners: &quot;If you opened the coffin and saw what remained of him, you would be shocked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His body was discovered at Namanve forest outside Kampala on January 14, 1993, &quot;half burnt, a horrifying sight.&quot; He was killed during the regime of Iddi Amin, perhaps because he had the courage to publish in his newspaper the complaints of women whose husbands had mysteriously disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Father Kiggundu had a premonition about his death: &quot;I feel they are pursuing me; now they are about to take me...&quot; he told a priest friend, shortly before his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Father Nyadru William, a priest of the Logbara tribe of Uganda was murdered, apparently to assuage the spirits in preparation for a cattle raid by one tribal group in Karimoja District where he worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It appears that a few week before, a sorcerer had said that in order to procure a successful raid, the sacrifice of a person riding a motor cycle was required. Father Nyadru was on a motor cycle on that fateful day. Aged 31 years, he was killed on the road to Moroto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cardinal Gantin says of the priests; &quot;They have written a new and beautiful page of the history of our evangelisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'They Are A Target' is jointly published by Paulines Publications, Africa and a Comboni Missionaries bi-monthly magazine, New People.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Niamey - Niger's new military leaders, facing increasing international isolation, have named an all-civilian government in which key cabinet ministers from the ousted leadership have been retained. They include the Finance, Defence and Foreign Affairs Ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coup has been roundly condemned by the international community, with the United States and European Union freezing aid to the West African state until democratic rule is restored.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 27, Lieutenant-Colonel Ibrahim Bare Mainassara deposed democratically elected President Mahamane Ousmane and set up the Council for National Salvation. Col. Mainassara appointed the deputy governor of the Central Bank of West African States, Mr. Boukary Adji, as Prime Minister. The bank is based in Dakar, Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new cabinet includes Mr Attaher Abdoulmoumine, one of the Tuareg rebel leaders who signed a peace accord with the government last April, as Secretary of State for the Interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Giving reasons for his takeover, Col. Mainassara said he wanted to end a 16-month stalemate between President Ousmane and his Prime Minister Hama Amadour, whose supporters held the majority in the impoverished country's parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new leaders have been making trips to neighbouring countries to rally support for their cause. Not surprisingly, one of those is southern neighbour and regional power, Nigeria, itself facing international isolation both for the execution last November of nine minority rights activists and continued military dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following his return from Nigeria, where he led a government delegation, the Vice-President of the ruling council, Colonel Youssoufa Maiga, said: &quot;We were heard by President Sani Abacha and we were well understood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;Everything which affects Niger concerns Nigeria, and vice- versa, and that is why we went to Abuja.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a national reconciliation forum set up by Col. Mainassara has recommended a six to 12-month transition to democratic rule. Meeting in a preliminary session on February 3, the forum repeated the military leaders' claims that political squabbling threatened to plunge mainly Muslim Niger into chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six to 12-month transitional period includes constitutional changes to strengthen the powers of an elected president and to drop the use of proportional representation voting. Changes were also proposed to limit the number of political parties to five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Most of the political parties have shown themselves to be parties based on family or geographical links within the framework of an outright multi-party system,&quot; the forum charged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cotonou - Benin's Catholic bishops fear violence may erupt in the small West African nation of 7.5 million people, following intelligence reports that the various political parties in the country have set up militias ahead of presidential elections scheduled for March this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Robert Sastre of the Benin Episcopal Conference went on state television on February 5 to express the bishops' alarm at recent developments at home; &quot;Constant rumours are reaching us from reliable state sources that armed militias are being established by the various political forces in the country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He read from a pastoral letter dated January 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the second time in less than one year that the Catholic Church leaders in Benin have warned about the deteriorating situation for the country's fragile democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They previously urged Beninois to undergo &quot;a moral conversion&quot; in order to make the six-year-old democratic experiment a success. They said the people of Benin themselves should bear the ultimate responsibility for their conservative attitude in the face of the challenges of the democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More significantly, the Catholic clergy reminded the leaders of the various political parties in the country that it was their patriotic duty to put the country before their partisan alliances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presidential elections in this West African nation are a continuation of the electoral process that started with parliamentary elections in March 1995. At least 2 million voters turned out to support contestants for 83 seats in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political observers say incumbent President Nicephore Soglo of the Renaissance Party faces an uphill task against a candidate of the opposition alliance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conakry - Guinean authorities have ordered the arrest of troops involved in a mutiny after some 2,000 soldiers demanding higher pay and better working conditions rampaged through the west African state's capital killing 50 people and wounding 100 others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebellious soldiers ran amok on February 2, looting shops in Conakry and shelling the presidential palace where President Lansana Conte was held up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the dead and wounded were civilians caught in the cross-fire.  Some 300 soldiers occupied Conakry airport before commandeering civilian vehicles to transport them into the city, firing machine-gun volleys in the air.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to sources close to the president, at one point on February 3, a group of soldiers had captured Conte and taken him to the Alpha Yaya military camp where the rebellion began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conte then sacked his Defence Minister Abdourahmane Diallo, whom the troops blamed for a deterioration in their conditions, but accused non-commissioned army officers in cahoots with several senior officers of attempting to wrest the country's leadership from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A group calling itself the Committee for National Salvation had circulated leaflets in the capital saying the rebels would &quot;fight on until the final victory.&quot; The document denounced &quot;the disorder, corruption and nepotism&quot; of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On February 3, President Conte finally appeared to be giving in to the soldiers' demands and announced that negotiations with rebel troops had &quot;wound up with an agreement&quot;. He appealed to them to &quot;return at once to their units.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing about 1,000 soldiers in Camp Samory, in the centre of Conakry, he said: &quot;It is, from now on, to me that you must address all your problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mutineers applauded him when he said that he was setting up a committee to look into troops' grievances, mainly salary increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Conte said the demands of the soldiers concerned five points, all of which could be achieved, but he did not reveal what the points were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the government said the main point was about an amnesty for the rebels, and notably of five senior officers, considered leaders of the rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Conte seized power in 1984 in a military coup, but in 1992, introduced a multi-party system and was elected president in December 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business resumed in Conakry on February 5 and Conte said he would introduce some changes in the army. He gave no details about the planned reform, but indicated that he would bring in military officers &quot;able to educate the soldiers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The order to arrest the mutineers issued by the Interior Ministry on February 6 seemed to contradict an earlier allusion to a possible amnesty by President Conte who, when asked about what he intended to do with the soldiers, said he would let &quot;democratic institutions to do their job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even as the order to arrest was being issued, soldiers were circulating leaflets in the capital warning: &quot;Let everyone be aware that, in case of arrests or reprisals, the entire army will retaliate energetically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to reliable sources some soldiers who took part in the rebellion had not returned to their barracks by last week and were still armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Guinea Defence Ministry, in another attempt to placate the discontented army, had, meanwhile, announced plans to pay compensation to families of soldiers killed while serving in the strife-torn neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An estimated 800 Guinean soldiers are serving in Sierra Leone alongside government forces fighting rebels there. The two countries have a military agreement which stipulates that each side will help the other in the event of aggression from a third party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other Guinean troops are deployed in Liberia as part of the Nigerian- led Economic Community of West African peacekeeping group sent there in 1990.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freetown - Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in Sierra Leone have called off a unilateral ceasefire, dashing hopes of peace talks to end the five-year-old civil war which has claimed thousands of lives and left this West African country's economy in tatters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move has further heightened uncertainty over general elections scheduled for February 26, which were nevertheless expected to be postponed to allow for peace talks between rebels and the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) government now led by Brigadier Julius Maada Bio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bio seized power from Captain Valentine Strasser on January 16 in a palace coup and immediately called on the rebels to come to the negotiating table without any preconditions. In response, Foday Sankoh's RUF declared a one-week ceasefire and said they were dropping all previous demands, including the withdrawal of foreign forces from Sierra Leone. The ceasefire was to be extended for the duration of talks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebels also urged the government to postpone the elections until the war was brought to an end. The new NPRC leadership agreed not to attack the rebels' positions while peace talks were under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But last week, the rebels announced that the ceasefire was off because several of their positions had come under fire from government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government soldiers, they claimed, &quot;aided by the Executive Outcomes war machine attacked our positions at several fronts in Togo, Pejehun and Bo areas (about 100 kilometres east of the capital, Freetown) along the Bo-Taiama highway between January 28 and January 30, 1996.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few days earlier, the government claimed several villages in the east had been attacked by RUF rebels. But in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, ans RUF spokesman denied the claims, saying the attackers were bandits exploiting the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Troops from the Executive Outcomes, a South African mercenary firm, along with those from Nigeria and Guinea have been assisting the Sierra Leonean army to end the rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, RUF rebels are reported to have captured three South Africans guarding the Sierra Rutile titanium mine in the southern town of Mobimbi. A local newspaper is quoted as saying the three are members of the Executive Outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the RUF ceasefire off, it is not clear how soon peace talks would begin and whether the elections would go ahead as planned. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), while maintaining its role as a humanitarian organisation, has said it would facilitate the talks by providing communication and other equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, by the time of going to press, reports indicated that Brig.  Bio had made his first contact by radio with rebel leader Foday Sankoh. Both men pledged their commitment to holding peace talks to resolve the crisis at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brig. Bio is reported saying he was ready to hold peace talks without preconditions anytime. However, Sankoh once again said he opposed foreign involvement, an apparent reference to foreign forces fighting alongside Sierra Leonean government forces.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - A new Catholic diocese has been created in Kenya, bringing to 20 the total number of dioceses in the country. At the same time, two local clergy have been consecrated bishops, bringing to 22, the total number of Catholic bishops in this East African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new diocese of Kericho in the Rift Valley Province, was carved out of Nakuru Diocese. It comprises two administrative districts, Kericho and Bomet which serve 15 parishes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spread out over 2,600 square kilometres, Kericho has some 190,330 Roman Catholics within an estimated local population of 1.2 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Philip Anyolo, the newly consecrated diocesan head, was ordained priest in 1983. He studied philosophy and theology locally and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new bishop has served the Catholic Church in Kenya as parish priest, diocesan secretary for the Eldoret Diocese and the chaplain of Moi University in Eldoret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newly consecrated too is Rt. Rev. Boniface Lelle, 48, for Kitui Diocese in the country's Eastern Province. He replaces Bishop Emeritus William Dunne, who has retired after reaching the canonical age of 75. Bishop Lelle becomes the first local bishop to head the diocese, which has 20 parishes serving some 90,564 Catholics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both ceremonies, held early this month were presided over by Cardinal Jozef Tomko, the Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelisation of People at the Vatican. He was assisted by several local bishops, led by Cardinal Maurice Otunga, the Archbishop of Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the inauguration of Kericho Diocese, Cardinal Tomko challenged church leaders to be fearless as they shepherd the faithful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another development, Cardinal Tomko on February 4 travelled to Isiolo, about 272 kilometres north of Nairobi to create a new apostolic vicariate and consecrate Fr. Luigi Locati, 66, as the bishop Apostolic Vicar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Apostolic Vicariate of Isiolo was carved out of Meru Diocese. Isiolo district, is in Kenya's arid and semi-arid region and has a high concentration of Muslims. Out of the estimated 84,000 people within the jurisdiction, only 20,000 are Catholics. The vicariate will administer seven parishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic Church in Kenya was instituted in 1953, after Nairobi, then under the Vicariate of Zanzibar, became an archdiocese and Metropolitan of the Ecclesiastical Province of Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church currently enjoys a membership of over 10 million followers within the national population of 27 million people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - A lobby group calling itself the Second Wives and Concubines Association of Uganda (SWICAU) has been formed in the Ugandan capital to fight for the rights of &quot;the other woman&quot; in a polygamous relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The acting chairperson of SWICAU is Mrs. Bethel Clare Mwanje, a career civil servant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the inauguration ceremony last month in the suburbs of Nansana, some 15 kilometres from here, the SWICAU chairperson noted that one of the association's primary goals is to improve the image of women in this category in the eyes of the churches and society. She asserted that second wives &quot;are people of honour and fidelity.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state-owned New Vision reported that the ceremony brought together some 200 Ugandan women from a cross section of the society who included human rights lawyers, businesswomen and other professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is important to get the churches, the law and society to change their attitude towards women in a polygamous relationship, said Mrs Mwanje.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Noting that &quot;society despises second wives and the law segregates them when it comes to inheritance of property following the man's death, particularly when the second wife or concubine has borne children with him,&quot; Mrs Mwanje also lamented the illegitimacy of children produced in such unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Society at large - including the churches - should also remember that women are often lured into relationships by married men who are aware they are committing bigamy but fail to state the fact to the woman. &quot;Women are always blamed irrespective of the man's fault,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Polygamous unions are a fact of life in Uganda as indeed in many parts of Africa. In a subsequent editorial, the state-owned daily New Vision pointed out that in Uganda, husbands hierarchically grade their wives in numerical order. &quot;This has caused strain and stress in society. Co-wives get into conflict and rivalry as they compete for the husband's affection. This does not augur well for the stability of the family and upbringing of the children.&quot; Grading of women also compounds their marginalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commentary suggested that ideally, SWICAU should not only popularise second wives and concubines but rather &quot;should take centre stage in social reform to crusade against these marital anomalies. They should vigorously educate young girls on the plight of being second or lower status wife or concubine in a polygamous union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The daily noted that church teachings would be compromised to accommodate the goals of SWICAU.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Political parties in southern Sudan have been discussing various options that can bring viable political development in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a five-day meeting organised in the Kenyan capital by the Union of Sudan African Parties (USAP) between January 8 and 12, speakers gave their views about the formation of an alliance or forum to advance political developments in southern Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Barri Wanje of the Patriotic Resistance Movement (PRM) suggested that all political parties in southern Sudan, should form an alliance for viable and effective political development in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official of the South Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) Dr. David Chan however opposed the creation of an alliance, saying that the concept calls for political and legal technicalities, that would be best handled by a political forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Chan, who is the spokesman for SSIM told APS in an interview that it was sad that the SPLA/M (Sudan People's Liberation Army/ Movement), did not attend the Nairobi meeting, although they were invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They missed a good chance to come forward and argue out their case as to how best we as Sudanese people can bring about the eargely awaited democratic development in southern Sudan,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reporting on the Nairobi meeting, Light and Hope for Sudan, a bi- monthly newsletter for the Christian Initiative for Peace in Sudan committee in its January 1996 issue, says; &quot;The aim of the on-going series of meetings is to develop a democratic way to settle policy differences between southerners and to evolve strategy instead of differences leading to interfactional violence. The existence of this initiative changes the political scene entirely and makes it possible for the south to put its case in the international community.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - Some 300 Anglican leaders, including three primates and South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have put their names to an appeal for greater tolerance of homosexuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The full-page appeal, which was to appear in British religious press on February 9 does not explicitly call for the Church of England to ordain gay ministers or to sanction homosexual marriages, but extends support to the Christian Movement of Gays and Lesbians, which has campaigned actively for these goals, the British Sunday Telegraph reported on February 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides Tutu, signatories to the appeal include primates Michael Peers of Canada, Richard Holloway of the Scottish Episcopal Church and Edmond Browning of the Episcopal Church in the United States, the Sunday Telegraph said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is to be published a few days before a church synod on February 12 (today).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglican officials believe the appeal will revive a debate on homosexuals that could split the church even more than did the issue of the ordination of women ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spokesman for the Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey declined to comment on the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move by the Anglicans, the official church of England, is the latest in a series of campaigns by different church leaders urging societies to change their rigid attitudes against homosexuals and lesbians to that of tolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 24, Zimbabwe's Catholic bishops also stepped into the row over gay rights sparked by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and condemned any attempt to &quot;harass, persecute or torture&quot; homosexuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe, who is himself a Catholic, faced international condemnation last year for likening gays to &quot;beasts&quot;, saying that they had &quot;no rights&quot;, and threatening to throw them in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an unusual pastoral letter, the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishop's Conference said it wanted &quot;to distance the church from any attempts to institute a 'witch-hunt' or hate campaign against persons with homosexual tendencies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The letter made the point that the Catholic church saw homosexuality as a &quot;disorder&quot;, adding that &quot;what is not in accordance with God's will as expressed in our nature cannot be claimed as a 'human right'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, &quot;while we want to eliminate a disease wherever it exists, we do not eliminate those who suffer from it,&quot; the bishops said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is therefore not right for anyone, including government, to harass, persecute or torture people simply because they are known to have this inclination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The human rights aspect of the issue was raised in August last year when the government banned a gay and lesbian group from participating in the Zimbabwe International Book Fair, which had human rights as its theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faced with international condemnation from Western governments -- including a group of 70 United States congressmen who sent him a protest letter and demonstrators in South Africa who dubbed him &quot;Africa's Hitler&quot; -- Mugabe, 71, was unrepentant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the American congressmen to &quot;keep their sodomy, bestiality, stupid and foolish ways to themselves,&quot; and went on to describe homosexuals as &quot;worse than pigs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka -Nikuv Computers has been sued by a Zambian private company for breach of contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Legal counsel for Chris Furniture, Kenneth Shepande, filed the writ of summons in the Lusaka High Court on Thursday, February 8, 1996, which read in part: &quot;The plaintiff's claim is for the sum of K3.569,000 being the balance of a K17, 460,000 contract price for the delivery of computer tables to the defendant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Furniture is claiming interest at the ruling bank rate from January 24, 1994, collection charges and costs. Chris Furniture managing director, Chris Ndhlovu, said Nikuv had asked his company to make them 300 desks valued at K17 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We accepted the deal and went into contract with them, but they later said we must first make them 170 desks worth K9 million of which they only paid us K5 million,&quot; Ndhlovu said. &quot;They asked us to suspend our business and concentrate on the desks since they needed them ready by January this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the conditions of the deal were that if the furniture was delayed, 25 per cent penalty would be surcharged against Chris Furniture. &quot;I do not understand why we cannot be paid since we met their deadline, though they delayed by supplying us materials late and making payment for the deposit by giving us a postdated cheque,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nikuv's project manager, Gershom Korda, also confirmed the deal. &quot;Go and ask Ndhlovu if we were pleased with his job,&quot; Korda said in an interview last week. &quot;If the desks were delivered in time, if he met all our obligations and why we really do not want to pay him.&quot; Ndhlovu says he does not know the reasons why Nikuv cannot pay him since they do not want to talk to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said when he went to inquire about his money, Korda ordered a paramilitary officer to throw him out of his office. &quot;I do not know exactly what we did to these people,&quot; Ndhlovu carped. &quot;We delivered their desks in time and I am sure they were satisfied with our work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndhlovu said the remaining balance cannot be said to be the 25 per cent penalty. &quot;The remaining balance is so far much more than the 25 per cent penalty,&quot; Ndhlovu said. &quot;We have been swindled and we have sued them for over K7 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Police have described the lead story of last Friday's issue of The Post as 'blatant lies' whose sole purpose is to discredit the integrity of the Zambia Police Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story claimed, quoting unnamed police sources, that President Frederick Chiluba was making desperate maneuvers to execute a second search on Post newspaper offices and its three editors in which incriminating documents, linking the paper's top editors to artificial clandestine activities aimed at creating insecurity in the country, are expected to be planted by state security personnel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police public relations officer, Francis Musonda, categorically dismissed the story headlined &quot;ANOTHER POST RAID&quot; saying the police took strong exception to the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At no time has the police service been associated with such unpalatable and unprofessional tendencies aimed at compromising its core value of delivering high quality service,&quot; Musonda said in a press statement last Friday. &quot;Besides we do not have names of the security officers mentioned in the story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story claimed a plan for the second search of the paper was to be executed by officers from the Criminal Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Zambia Police Service and was to be headed by district intelligence officer, Musole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paper claimed that Musole was to be assisted by detective chief inspector Chiyabi from CIU (State House). The paper also named other security personnel to be used in the claimed search as Capt. John Mwaba from the military intelligence, and a Lt. Col. Mulenga from the Zambia National Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week police raided the offices of The Post on both Cha Cha Cha Road and Chandwe Musonda Road in search of material related to the constitution of Zambia and its adoption. The raid followed President Chiluba's decree banning the paper's edition 401 of Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Two local bands have threatened to boycott recording their works<BR>in Zambia because of the increasing rate of piracy on foreign music which<BR>has caused the sale of local music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serenje and Masasu Kalindula bands have decided to with-hold their work<BR>until remedial measures to stop exploitation of artists' were initiated by<BR>the government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serenje band leader Syman Kaseba and Masasu band leader John Mulemena<BR>contended, in separate interviews, that the high rate of piracy in the<BR>country was stiffling their business prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have lost more than 90 per cent of our sales because piracy is<BR>growing rapidly and there is no control of the practice and we cannot<BR>continue like this,&quot; Kaseba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;Piracy had become rampant and government should speed up the<BR>implementation of the laws contained in the literary and performing rights<BR>act because this is the way we earn our living.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulemena concurred with Kaseba and accused the government of ineptitude<BR>in curbing the practice despite unveiling the act which came into effect<BR>last year. &quot;We have done the best we can to ensure that we meet the demands<BR>of our fans but we are getting little or nothing from our efforts as most of<BR>the tapes are dubbed and find their way on the market before we realise<BR>anything from the original tapes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;when is government going to enforce the act to make<BR>musicians enjoy their sweat?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Union of Musicians (ZUM) official said efforts to eradicate<BR>piracy has reached an advanced stage. Government says they were working with<BR>immigration department, police and ZUM.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has rated the work of Maluma who has been in that country for more<BR>than eight years as very talented. &quot;Maluma is a very clever<BR>composer/arranger of reggae and pop(abeit heavily augmented with<BR>percussion),&quot; it read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The publication says that each song has been a perfect progression of<BR>verse building to chorus being supported by a truly fitting combination of<BR>instruments and female backing voices. The highlights are the sweet<BR>reggae-inflected What about me, the soulfully optimistic 'Its Gonna Be<BR>Alright'<BR>and jive track Reggae 'N' Soul all recorded by the ABC studios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the fifth album.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Police have been instructed by President Frederick Chiluba to<BR>arrest Post editors and charge them with criminal libel for their stories<BR>about the President's parentage, birth place and alleged forgery of a form<BR>two certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President's public relations and press aide, Richard Sakala, told<BR>journalists from the government owned and controlled media on Wednesday that<BR>State House was finally ready to take Post editors to court to be criminally<BR>prosecuted under the defamation of the President law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sakala said the editors would be prosecuted for publishing stories<BR>claiming Chiluba was born in a Zairean hospital at Chibambo Mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President had earlier bragged, in the open, that he could not have<BR>been born at Chibambo Hospital because it was only built after his birth and<BR>accused the paper of imagining its existence. His reaction came after the<BR>return of a State House sponsored &quot;investigative&quot; team to Chibambo led by<BR> Sakala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Documentation and information from people who know the area has, however,<BR>disproved the President's claims about Chibambo not being in existence in<BR>1944. And the President has so far not given a categorical position on his<BR>birth place having claimed before that he was born in Chamboli Kitwe, be<BR>fore his relatives last year named Musangu village as his birth place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he himself has recently claimed he was in fact born in Wusakile,<BR>Kitwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Sakala, Post editors, will also be charged with offences<BR>relating to their reports that the President has no form two certificates<BR>and at one time borrowed one from a Frederick Chiluba, now with Chipata's<BR>Luangwa Industries, to advance himself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The office of the Auditor General should be brought under the<BR>direct supervision of parliament to make it more independent says an<BR>opposition member of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petauke UNIP member of parliament Lavu Mulimba said in parliament<BR>yesterday that retaining the Auditor General's office under the executive<BR>erodes its independence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that the Auditor General's office<BR>is not seen and treated as part of the executive because it removes the<BR>essence<BR> of its independence,&quot; Mulimba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulimba also called for the Auditor General to be given leverage to hire<BR>his own staff instead of depending on personnel division of cabinet office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luangeni UNIP member of parliament Johnstone Jere in his contribution<BR>called for enhanced training and improvement of conditions of service for<BR>officers from the Auditor General's office to enhance its effectiveness. He<BR>also called for the office to be allowed to charge government offices for i<BR>ts service and should impose higher charges for those found with<BR>expenditures about their budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Chilubi MMD member of parliament Chisala Mponda complained about<BR>failure of the office to present audited reports to parliament's public<BR>accounts committee within the stipulated period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to the contributions, Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda agreed<BR>that the K2.5 billion allocated in this year's budget for the Auditor<BR>General's office was still insufficient but said it was as far as government<BR>would give from the K4.2 billion it asked for. He invited a write-up from<BR>members calling for the de-linking of the office from the executive so that<BR>the matter could be studied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Clandestine voter registration centres have been uncovered at<BR>private domestic homes in Lusaka, the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team<BR>(ZIMT), has claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIMT vice-president Isaac Zimba said in Lusaka yesterday his organisation<BR>had discovered one such centre at a home in Kaunda square stage 2. Zimba<BR>said the house, number 29, belongs to a ruling MMD official who he could not<BR>name.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to ZIMT only members of the MMD were being registered at the<BR>Kaunda Square house. &quot; I went to the house after a tip-off and found a<BR>person who I learnt was the area branch chairman addressing cadres saying<BR>they could register at the house instead of going to stand on queues,&quot; Zimba<BR>sa<BR>id. &quot;I also presented my national registration card and my old voters card<BR>to the man who went into the house and a short while later came out with a<BR>filled in application form which he gave to me,&quot; said Zimba, displaying the<BR>form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Director of Elections Rabson Mwansa refused to comment on the matter and<BR>referred all queries to the Lusaka City Council who he said were the agents<BR>for the voters' registration exercise in Lusaka. &quot;That question should be<BR>directed to the people that are directly responsible for the registratio<BR>n exercise,&quot; Mwansa said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka province registration officer John Mulenga, however, confirmed<BR>receiving reports about the clandestine registration centres in Kaunda<BR>square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is not clear where the centres were drawing the registration<BR>documents from and whether they were genuine and accounted for. &quot;Its<BR>extremely shocking,&quot; Mulenga said in an interview yesterday. &quot; But we are<BR>carrying out investigations to establish exactly where the house is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The card given to Zimba was marked region:05, District:04, station:227<BR>and serial number: 0792. Mulenga said these details could be traced to<BR>Masasa polling station in Munali constituency. He could, however, not say<BR>whether any domestic houses have been apportioned registration duties and<BR>admit<BR>ted there was a possibility that political parties could connive with<BR>electoral agents to get into an arrangement which guarantied registration<BR>for as many of their members as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said all documentation in the voter registration exercise were &quot;state<BR>property which should be properly accounted for&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The application forms are accountable documents given to the<BR>registration officers in the field who sign for them on the equipment issue<BR>form and are expected in return to prepare a control sheet which indicates<BR>the forms issued,&quot; Mulenga explained. The reports come in the wake of<BR>continued fe<BR>ars of massive rigging of this year's presidential and general elections as<BR>of irregularities in the registration of voters under the Israeli firm<BR>Nikuv.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Judges, lawyers, unio-nists and politicians yesterday expressed<BR>their outrage at continued attacks on the judiciary. They were particularly<BR>incensed by finance minister Ronald Penza's attack oN industrial relations<BR>court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy chief justice Bona-venture Bweupe, who has just returned from<BR>medical treatment in South Africa after a road accident last December, said<BR>Penza's attacks where unbecoming of a senior government minister.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We do not need to be confrontational with each other as arms of<BR>government,&quot; justice Bweupe said in an interview at home yesterday. &quot;It was<BR>unfortunate that the words came from the minister who is supposed to know<BR>better and protect the judiciary.&quot;<BR> Justice Bweupe, however, advised members of the judiciary to refrain from<BR>responding to the attacks and concentrate on their job. &quot;We should not even<BR>answer back to justify our judgments,&quot; Bweupe said from his home in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But High Court Judge Kabazo Chanda has a different view. Judge Chanda<BR>says while the public was free to comment on judgments he will not condone<BR>personal attacks. &quot;The integrity and personality of the judges are not for<BR>public attack. Tearing the character of a judge into pieces publicly is con<BR>temptuous,&quot; Justice Chanda said. &quot;Anyone who or any newspaper which fancies<BR>that kind of pastime is countering imprisonment for wantonly lowering the<BR>dignity of the court in this country, which dignity we cherish so much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penza said, on ZNBC's 'Tell the Nation' radio programme on Wednesday<BR>morning, that the Industrial Relations Court ruling a warding a 45 per cent<BR>salary increment to civil servants was &quot;irresponsible&quot; and deplored the<BR>court's &quot;low understanding of economic issues&quot;. &quot;The judgment was very<BR>irrespo<BR>nsible because you cannot give yourselves hefty salary increases when your<BR>budget is funded by foreigners,&quot; Penza said. &quot; I would rather lose my job<BR>than contribute to the running down of the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Bweupe, however, advised that if government felt aggrieved by the<BR>judgment it can ask the Attorney General to appeal. And registrar of the<BR>High Court of Zambia, Ruth Zulu, said government should respect the judgment<BR>because they were the ones who took the matter to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Civil Servants Union of Zambia secretary general Japhet Mo-onde said the<BR>statement by Penza has angered his members. He called on Penza to resign<BR>from his job if he cannot accept the judgment. &quot;He will definitely not be<BR>missed,&quot; Moonde charged. And National Union of Public Service Workers gener<BR>al secretary, Davis Chingoni, agreed with Moonde and warned of &quot;severe<BR>labour consequences if government went by Penza's stand&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State counsel Daniel Lisulo said: &quot;We cannot allow them to erode the rule<BR>of law by their criminal statements, characters like Penza must be cited for<BR>gross contempt of court.&quot; And an enraged civil servant in the office of the<BR>permanent secretary in Solwezi, Dick Chama, said &quot;public workers wer<BR>e fed up with Penza&quot;. In Lusaka unionised workers will today hold an<BR>emergency meeting at Penza's Ministry of Finance headquarters to work out a<BR>workers stand to Penza's statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York -The Security Council this afternoon extended the mandate of the<BR>United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until<BR>31 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the Council supported the intention of the<BR>Secretary-General, &quot;in the absence of meaningful progress towards completion<BR>of the Settlement Plan&quot;, to bring the situation to the immediate attention<BR>of the Council and, in such an eventuality, to submit a detailed programme<BR>for a<BR>phased withdrawal of MINURSO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council took that action by unanimously adopting Security Council<BR>resolution 1042 (1996), by which it also expressed deep concern about the<BR>stalemate that hindering the identification process and the consequent lack<BR>of progress towards completion of the Settlement Plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Noting the views expressed by the Government of Morocco and the Frente<BR>Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Hamra y Rio de Oro (POLISARIO), the<BR>Council called on the two parties to consider additional ways to create<BR>confidence between themselves and to facilitate the implementation of the S<BR>ettlement Plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Settlement Plan, which was accepted by the two parties on 30 August<BR>1988 and approved by the Council on 27 June 1990 in its resolution 658<BR>(1990), entails the holding of a referendum without military or<BR>administrative restraints, to enable the people of Western Sahara to choose<BR>between ind<BR>ependence and integration with Morocco.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting, which was called to order at 12:50 p.m., was adjourned at<BR>12:51 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the Security Council met this afternoon to consider the situation in<BR>Western Sahara, it had before it a report of the Secretary-General (document<BR>S/1995/43 and Corr.1). In his report, the Secretary-General advises that the<BR>Council may want to consider two options. The first would be to ext<BR>end the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western<BR>Sahara (MINURSO) until 31 May, thus allowing time for the identification<BR>process to be resumed and an opportunity to test the political will of the<BR>parties. If at any time before the expiry of the extended mandate there ap<BR>peared to be no or very little improvement, the Secretary-General would<BR>bring the matter to the attention of the Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a second option, he suggests, the Council might decline approving a<BR>further extension unless it was accompanied by the condition that<BR>outstanding problems be resolved by specific dates. Consequently, plans<BR>should be prepared for a phased withdrawal of MINURSO. The<BR>Secretary-General's Specia<BR>l Envoy has conveyed to the parties and observer States the readiness of the<BR>Council to contemplate the withdrawal of the Mission despite concern that<BR>withdrawal could have destabilizing effects on the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General's report was issued in response to the Council's<BR>request in resolution 1033 (1995), for the Secretary-General to provide<BR>options for its consideration, including the orderly withdrawal of MINURSO<BR>in the event intensified consultations failed to lead to agreement. The Coun<BR>cil also asked for information on the findings of the Secretary-General's<BR>Special Envoy following consultations with the Government of Morocco and the<BR>Frente Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Hamra y Rio de Oro<BR>(POLISARIO), the two parties to the settlement plan. The consultations were<BR>part<BR>of the Secretary-General's effort to resolve differences hindering the<BR>identification of applicants eligible to vote in the referendum on Western<BR>Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report, the POLISARIO has agreed to proceed with the<BR>identification of all applicants included in the 1974 census, that is,<BR>subfractions for which lists of sheikhs or alternates from both parties have<BR>already been established. The POLISARIO continued to decline to cooperate in<BR> the identification of another large group of applicants -- certain tribal<BR>groups which were not represented by subfraction in the 1974 census. The<BR>POLISARIO held the view that applications from persons other than those<BR>belonging to subfractions specifically represented in the census were not<BR>admi<BR>ssible. Further, it would withdraw from the entire process if there was any<BR>attempt to identify such applicants with the participation of a sheikh from<BR>one side only. In his discussions with the POLISARIO, the special Envoy<BR>emphasized that the Identification Commission was obliged to process all a<BR>pplications submitted on time. The Acting Special Representative of the<BR>Secretary-General also advises that if both parties cooperated fully, and<BR>the Identification Commission were to be expanded to its full complement of<BR>11 identification centres, it would be possible, in theory, to complete the<BR>identification process in 22 weeks or so, or, if the Commission operated at<BR>half capacity, in about 44 weeks. Allowing for appeals, a period ranging<BR>from six months to one year would be required to complete the identification<BR>process. At the time of the report, the total number of persons identifi<BR>ed was 60,257.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council as a whole or individual Member States may also wish to<BR>consider ways to assist the parties in establishing a dialogue, the<BR>Secretary-General says. Contacts between the parties could be arranged on a<BR>confidential basis. For progress to be achieved, the two parties must have<BR>vision<BR>of the post-referendum period. The Secretary-General encourages all<BR>concerned to help the parties to achieve such a vision. Other aspects of the<BR>settlement plan that need to be addressed are the code of conduct,<BR>confinement of troops and exchange of prisoners of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the reporting period, the Secretary-General states, the<BR>cease-fire was violated on one occasion when the POLISARIO tried to restrict<BR>the movement of the military observers. The situation was resolved after<BR>some discussion. On 19 November, 186 Moroccan prisoners of war were<BR>repatriated w<BR>ith the assistance of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)<BR>and the Governments of the United States and Argentina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Draft Resolution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The full text of draft resolution 1042 (1996) reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Security Council,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Reaffirming all its previous resolutions on the question of the Western<BR>Sahara,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transcript of 'a testimony' by Dr. Owens Wiwa (brother of Ken Saro Wiwa),<BR>steering committee member of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni<BR>People (MOSOP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FIRST MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I first met Brian Anderson the chairman and managing director of Shell<BR>Nigeria on the Queens birthday party 1995 in Lagos, and he promises to my<BR>wife to help, to see that Ken gets adequate medical attention, he says he<BR>will see what he can do and we leave at the end of the party and I write of<BR>my encounter to Ken send it through my wife who leaves this day to see Ken<BR>and through this letter we are very happy to learn that Ken has been taken<BR>to the hospital the military hospital for the first time after being in<BR>detention for about 11 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SECOND MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well I asked him if he would use his influence to stop the trial<BR>announced so that Ken can get can get out of the illegal detention and so<BR>that negotiation can start between Shell and the Ogoni people. And he says<BR>that's difficult, but not impossible but that the international campaign is<BR>hurting Shell and the Nigerian government and if we can stop the campaign<BR>that he might be able to do something. So I tell him that I don't have the<BR>power to do that, but however I will pass the information to Ken, and he<BR>also at that time said I should try and get into the press - to get a press<BR>release and get him a copy, you know mentioning the fact that there is no<BR>environmental devastation in Ogoniland and I just say how can I do that, you<BR>mean I tell the world that what we've been saying ever since 1990 is a lie,<BR>there is no way I will do that.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that happened at our second meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THIRD MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wrote to Ken and Ken replied back with a letter to Brian Anderson where<BR>he gives him two scenarios. The first one - Ken gets killed and becomes a<BR>martyr or they (Shell) did the right thing, use their influence with the<BR>Nigerian government and get him out of their illegal detention and stop th<BR>e charade of the tribunal. And when that happens the lobby with the writers<BR>will stop, the lobby by the human rights groups will stop and that remains<BR>the environmental campaigners and when the environmental lobby sees that he<BR>is now discussing with Shell they will lower or stop their campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Brian Anderson tells me that he will no longer be available for<BR>further discussion as he'll be travelling frequently but that I should<BR>continue the discussion with Mr Achebe. Mr Achebe stresses the importance of<BR>continuous dialogue and after a week I phone Achebe and I'm told he's in<BR>Germany<BR> I phone again a second time and I'm told he's in Abucja and I phone again<BR>and I'm told he's in Port Harcourt holding meetings with other Ogoni people<BR>and I phone another time and he's not in the office and all this time I'm<BR>leaving my number and my messages and I don't get any reply so I now swit<BR>ch back to phone Anderson both in his office and in his house. Now I phoned<BR>the first time in his house and they tell me he's at a cocktail party I<BR>phone another time and he's having lunch and I ask whether I can phone after<BR>lunch I don't get any answer, but I still phone and still he's not availa<BR>ble and I phone another time and I hear he's not around you know and then I<BR>sort if get the message and I write back to Ken that it appears that I'm<BR>being avoided and Ken writes back - that I shouldn't bother as it appears a<BR>decision has been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DEVASTATION OF OGONILAND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ogoni environment is devastated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I got involved in Ogoniland after coming back to Ogoni after my<BR>University medical school and then the first thing that struck me is that<BR>the trees around my father's house the oranges and the guavas are no longer<BR>there the ones there are not producing any fruit and they sort of shrunken.<BR>Then I go to the hospital and the spectrum of diseases I see there is quite<BR>different from the ones I was taught at school or the ones I saw in other<BR>places I'd worked in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lot of respiratory diseases - high incidence of asthma, cancer,<BR>bronchitis and I'm quite surprised and also some bizarre skin diseases and a<BR>high level of miscarriages which is quite different from other areas in<BR>Nigeria that are not producing oil. And the land Ogoni is a small place<BR>about 404 square miles 12 miles by 32 and large expanse of land that nothing grows on because of the oil spillages that have happened because of oil blow outs gas flares all over Ogoniland. You don't know when it is night it's always glowing. With the noise from the flow stations - it's very deafening and the people speak rather they shout the way of talking because they have to<BR>get across to the other person. And the pipe line gas and oil pipelines<BR>criss-crossing the whole place on the surface of the ground passing in front<BR>of houses at the back of houses on farm land unprotected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SHELL CLAIM SABOTAGE BY OGONI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shell claims that the environmental devastation in Ogoniland is due to<BR>sabotage of the installations by Ogoni people, as far as I know no Ogoni<BR>person no MOSOP activist has ever been convicted of sabotage of oil<BR>installations. The Ogoni people would be the last people on earth to go near<BR>the Shell installations because they know that if anything goes wrong on the<BR>pipelines or on the installations it is their land which they hold precious<BR>that will be spoiled - that will be devastated it is their streams from<BR>which they fish and drink water that will be polluted because their is no<BR>piped on water in Ogoniland it's only the water from the streams so no Ogoni<BR>person will go near any Shell installation for sabotage because that would<BR>lead to spillage and we understand spillages and devastated land more than<BR>any people in this world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EVIDENCE THAT SHELL ARE INVOLVED WITH MILITARY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I drive down to the village of Korokor-tai when I get there I meet<BR>another young man on the ground in a pool of blood at the feet of his mother<BR>and I'm told that he was shot by Major (Okuntino??) who had come there in<BR>the Shell bus accompanied by Shell executives and they had come to the<BR>village, said they were coming to look for Shell trucks. In my clinic in Bori<BR>Ogoniland I see the police constable coming to my clinic to tell me that all<BR>Ogoni people in the police in Ogoni land have been transferred out and I'm<BR>scared and he shows me the posting order transferring them and immediately<BR> I get to my car because that's frightening and go to visit my brother in<BR>hospital and I tell him what I've just heard and give him the police posting<BR>order and he immediately writes on it telling the world about what is<BR>happening and he's afraid that the first episode of genocide is being<BR>planned against the people, the Ogoni people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I see foreign journalists in Bori and I ask what's happening they said<BR>they heard that there's shooting a journalist from the Guardian of London<BR>and one from the Independent. And I take them to the village Kaa where most<BR>of my patients come from and we arrive there and it's like a small atomic<BR>bomb has been placed on the village I mean dropped on the village,<BR>everything the market is completely destroyed, the school the houses even<BR>the trees are on the ground and it is very very frightening and we do know<BR>this time there were police, I mean a military presence in Ogoniland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were stationed not too far from my clinic so I go back to the army<BR>and ask them what has happened, and we go back there and they see the place<BR>and one of the officials says that he hasn't seen this sort of thing even<BR>while he was serving in Liberia that no destruction has ever been to this level and in that particular incident 35 people are killed and it continues<BR>like that another 7 Ogoni villages are all destroyed and a total of about<BR>one thousand people are killed in these raids by people using sophisticated<BR>weapons on unarmed villages and my patients tell me that the soldiers a<BR>rrived across Andoni river with Shell boats and while all this is going on<BR>we notice the presence of Shell helicopters hovering around and we're<BR>actually very very worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DETENTION OF OWENS WIWA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the 26th December 1993 on Boxing day I'm in my house with my wife<BR>who's pregnant and her sister as well come to spend Christmas with us and a<BR>captain in the Nigerian army Captain Tunde Odina comes in and has a beer in<BR>my house and eats the food my wife has prepared and at the end of it he tells me to take a holiday, to leave Ogoniland go to Lagos or somewhere. At about 5 O'clock another Major comes in he calls himself Major Akintola of the Army Intelligence Unit at the Brigade in Bori camp and he tells me that the governor of the state Lieutenant Colonel Komo wants to see me and Barika Idamkue because at this time Barika Idamkue is the secretary of the Ogoni<BR>Relief and Rehabilitation Committee and I'm the coordinator so I mean we go<BR>there happily thinking that the Governor wants to give some relief to the<BR>people so at the end of the conversation I tell him that I was told by<BR>a captain, Captain Tunde Odina that I was to be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the Governor tells me that is not true that is just one of the rumours<BR>that we hear and keep telling people and there's nothing like that so I go<BR>back to my house have dinner with my family and go to bed. At about 2am the<BR>same captain who had come to my house you know to eat and drink comes<BR>in shouting, breaking my door and asks where is Dr Wiwa, I say well I'm here<BR>and then the other soldiers climb the fence and generally make noise and<BR>then I ask what is the matter and he tells me you are, by the order of the<BR>Federal Republic of Nigeria you are under arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So I go back to my room change into my clothes and go into the 504<BR>military vehicle and the other soldiers enter squeeze me in and they take me<BR>straight to the country home of Mr Ledum Mitee the Deputy president of MOSOP<BR>and repeat the same sort of thing they did in my house and bring the guy i<BR>nto the car and then the soldiers are coming inside too with their guns<BR>reeking of alcohol and marijuana and generally threatening us you know, and<BR>took us straight to the Air force base in Port Harcourt and later to the<BR>house of the government reservation division in Port Harcourt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And we stayed there until the 4th of January at about 5 O'clock or so<BR>Major Okuntimo comes in to meet us and to discuss. We ask him why we are<BR>detained he doesn't tell us anything, all he says is he's following his<BR>orders and then curiously asks us that since MOSOP is big it's powerful that<BR>we should join forces with him you know to see that one Mr Lawson-Jack senior<BR>executive of Shell in Port Harcourt is removed and we tell him that we don't<BR>do things like that. We talk about ideas and how to change corporate behaviour in terms of the environmental devastation of Ogoniland we are not in for removing individuals and all that and he insist and so we ask him why, why do you want the man off? and then he explains that the man has been undercutting him in his payments that he was also receiving from Shell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And after our discussion he tells us that we are released and on getting<BR>out I meet my mother-in-law and I ask about my wife and she answers that<BR>they are fine, I say what do you mean they are fine? I only have one wife,<BR>so she says they are fine that you have a child I said a child ?, she said yes, a son, I said yes how do I know it's a son I said I dreamt you know but then my wife is not due but I rushed down to the hospital that she's supposed to have delivered and I go in there and see her very happy and beside her there's, there's a young kid you know all red and cries when he sees me and I go and pick up my son and I feel very happy and I decide to forget and forgive my detention because that has brought me a son and asked my wife how everything happens and she tells me that after they are taking me away after some hours when daylight was coming she decides to come and look for me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And at this time there are many roadblocks manned by the army in<BR>Ogoniland and she is stopped in one of the roadblocks and she comes out, she<BR>is asked to come out of the car, she comes out and they ask her who she is<BR>and she tells the person that she's my wife and they say Oh that trouble<BR>maker so they ask her to identify herself further, she says she's a housewife<BR>and housewives don't carry ID cards. So they search her and they decide to<BR>search her person and she doesn't like that and the army man tell her to go<BR>into the stream, the stream is polluted covered with oil, my wife doesn't<BR> know how to swim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She protests, she gets the gun, they put up the gun pushing her from the<BR>back and she is pushed into the pond, into the stream but because of her<BR>hydrophobia she comes out and then the man aims the nozzle of the gun at her<BR>pregnant abdomen and then contractions start to come on and that process<BR> leads her to the hospital and my baby comes out born on January 4th Ogoni<BR>day and that's how I get my child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C - Nigerian Lawyer Olisa Agbakoba was detained several times this weekend after returning from an international trip,<BR>according to Felix C. Morka, coordinator of the Nigerian Human<BR>Rights Community Liaison Office in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Olisa Agbakoba was one of the lawyers who represented activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was hanged last year by the Nigerian government. Mr. Morka, who operates a Washington, DC based liason office for the Lagos based<BR>Civil Liberties Organisation and the Constitutional Rights<BR>Project, released the following statement on Monday 5 February:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Olisa Agbakoba, founder and ex-president of the Civil Liberties Organization (CLO) was arrested at about 7pm on Saturday, February 3, 1996 by agents of the State Security Services (SSS) at the Lagos Murtala Mohammed International Airport upon his arrival from London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was questioned for over an hour regarding his recent travel in<BR>Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States and then released.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, his International Passport and other travel documents were seized by the agents. On Sunday, February 4, 1996, Mr. Agbakoba was rearrested at his home by four state agents and taken to the SSS office where he was further questioned for over two hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was later released with an order to report back today, Monday<BR>February 5, 1996. Mr. Agbakoba's passport has not been released to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (On Monday evening, Felix Morka in Washington said that Mr. Olisa<BR>Agbakoba was feeling ill on Monday and did not go back to the SSS<BR>office. He remained at his home in Lagos.).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Millions of Israelis are reportedly embarrassed by the revelation in an Israeli newspaper Maariv on January 24, that the Israeli Blood Transfusion Service routinely destroyed blood donated by the Ethiopian Jewish community, commonly called Falashas (or Fereshmura in Hebrew, a term that also encompasses Ethiopian &quot;Christianised Jews&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maariv reported that the discarded blood packs had instructions directing that such donated blood be destroyed, because the donor came from Ethiopia. The newspaper said it was feared that the Fereshmura (Ethiopian Jews) had a higher prevalence of HIV infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the Maariv account, thousands of Ethiopian Jews took to the streets to protest what they saw as a &quot;racist&quot; practice against them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister Shimon Peres acted quickly to defuse Ethiopian Jewish anger - he offered his government's sincere apologies to the immigrant community, saying his government had not been aware of what was going on.  This was echoed by the Israeli government spokesman Uri Dromi who asserted that the agency's reaction was not government policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the spokeswoman for the Israeli Blood Transfusion Service said they had taken the decision purely on medical grounds. Although she avoided mentioning HIV or the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome AIDS, she emphasised that the Fereshmura had &quot;a higher percentage of transfusion related illnesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why they had continued to encourage the Ethiopian community in Israel to donate blood if they knew it would be destroyed anyway, she replied that they did not wish to segregate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jonathan Meeidan spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy in Nairobi, described the whole episode as unfortunate. He said hardliners in Israel tended to fear that, relative to the rest of the Israeli community, &quot;the immigrant community had comparatively higher HIV infection rates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meeidan discounted racial connotations in the decision, saying Israeli society was generally &quot;very conservative&quot; with a very low rate of HIV infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ethiopian Jewish and Ethiopian Christianised Jews number about 50,000. Most of them arrived in Israel from Ethiopia in the mid- eighties through &quot;Operation Solomon&quot;, an airlift which was initially conducted secretly and sponsored by the Israeli government and also supported by the College of Rabbis. At the time of the airlift, Ethiopia was in the grip of twin calamities of famine and civil war in which hundreds of thousands perished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopian Jews claim to be descendants of one of the ten lost tribes of Israel. Their Ethiopian name, Falashas is of Amharic origin, meaning &quot;strangers in Ethiopia,&quot; an allusion to the perception that they trace their lineage to the tribe of Dan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their oral literature, they speak of their origins from the time of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba who lived 10 centuries before Christ.  This legendary account of their roots appears to be supported by the fact that they practised a form of Judaism that existed around the time King Solomon's temple was destroyed by marauding Babylonians some 600 years before Christ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, some scholars have discounted these accounts and suggested instead that the Falashas were converted to Judaism in the 6 century A.D (after Christ) by a migrant Jewish community that lived in Upper Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The breakthrough for them came in 1975 (ten years before &quot;Operation Solomon&quot;) when the Israel Chief Rabbinate recognised them as Jews but ruled that all Ethiopian Jews would have to undergo a symbolic conversion to remove any doubts about their Jewish status. Some Ethiopian Jews resented this process saying they were &quot;the true and original Jews.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the secret airlift from 1985, a number of Ethiopian Christians took advantage, posing their children as Jews to gain automatic citizenship in Israel. But when such cases were discovered, a controversy erupted.  Questions were asked as to whether such children or children of mixed Christian and Jewish marriages should be symbolically initiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Meles Zenawi overthrew Mengistu Haile Mariam in the early 90's, thousands of &quot;Christianised Jews&quot; were allowed to migrate to Israel. There are Ethiopian Jews who converted to the Orthodox faith early this century, some say, in order to advance their economic status in Ethiopia. Many of these people had been abandoned weeping at Addis Ababa Airport when the original &quot;Operation Solomon&quot; concluded in the early 90s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For many Ethiopian Jews, arriving in Israel for the first time constituted a real cultural shock. For example, they were surprised to find that some Israelis routinely violated the Sabbath or even ate forbidden foods. On the other hand, to the Israelis, the Fereshmura were more difficult to assimilate into their new homes than Jews from the Eastern Block. It took long for them to fit into the more Europeanised Israeli society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were serious accusations that the Ethiopian Jews were often segregated against or housed in deprived areas of cities. Many Israelis went out of their way to encourage them to assimilate faster including inviting them into settlements (Kibutz).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The blood transfusion episode is unlikely to damage the image of Israeli in Africa given the speedy apologies offered by the Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres after the uproar by the Ethiopian community in Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent years Israel has enjoyed &quot;a second coming&quot; in Africa where the country now supports many technical and economic schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we went to press it was reported that the Ethiopian government had summoned the Israeli ambassador in Addis Ababa to express &quot;deep concern&quot; over the treatment of the Ethiopian Jews.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - For Faith Mbithe Musembi, 28, God's miracles sometimes include providing money to His needy faithful. Four years ago Mbithe prayed daily for God's deliverance from the bondage of a vicious circle of poverty. She says, &quot;Jehovah must have heard my prayers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, Mbithe runs her own hair salon and a dress-making kiosk, employs four assistants and is in the process of expanding her hair dressing business. She attributes her success to continuous prayers and the Kibera Savings and Credit Initiative (KSCI), a loan scheme for the poor of the sprawling Kibera slums in Nairobi, home to some 500,000 people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Perhaps we are unique, where others ask for tangible guarantees before risking out their money, all we do is trust that our creditors will pay. Of course they have to begin by saving some money with us,&quot; said Seth Munyambo a senior field officer with the Ambassador Development Agencies (ADA), an organisation supporting the Kibera Savings and Credit Initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says; &quot;When the programme started in 1993, we hoped to cater for the needs of small business people who had nobody other than God to turn to for financial assistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, ADA, a local Christian non-governmental organisation and other interested supporters who have make KSCI a reality, had more in store for the people of Kibera. &quot;We too intended to reach out the Gospel of Christ to the people of Kibera, be they Christians or non- Christians,&quot; added Munyambo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Dorcas Ojwang, 55, the programme is nothing short of a big reward. A fishmonger, she has yet to secure a loan because her savings &quot;are not enough for what I have in mind,&quot; she notes. However, she has benefitted immensely from the Bible study lessons that go with the business management classes which have now become an integral part of the programme. &quot;I love God. Every time we meet, it is as if I get closer to Him,&quot; she says, referring to KSCI's weekly group meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dorcas notes that through the KSCI, she has also learnt how to relate to customers, which in turn has boosted her business and income. &quot;Before I started attending our weekly meetings, I used to think that customers always come on their own. Now I know that I must entice them,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Munyambo says there is no point in lending money to small scale business people who do not have any management skills in the first place.  &quot;Many of our members come with very little knowledge of record keeping. Often they too are very poor managers of the little incomes that come their way.  This of course compounds their poverty. We took it upon ourselves to teach them business management techniques as well,&quot; he told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Auma Ndururu, a 50-year-old vegetable vendor conceded that the best she had learnt from the programme was record keeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus what had started as a small prayer group meeting at Mr. Fredrick Okwaro's delapidated shoe-maker's kiosk in 1993 has grown into a savings and credit programme, seeking to nourish the slum dwellers' temporal and spiritual needs. Explains 39 year-old Okwaro, a father of seven and one of the pioneer members of KSCI: &quot;We were barely 20 faithful attending evening Bible lessons run by pastors from the African Inland Church (AIC). Then we suggested that we be assisted in our daily struggles to survive too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luck was on their side. Along came Larry Warren of the New Direction Ministries, a Christian organisation based in California, United States, which volunteered some initial financial assistance to Kibera Savings and Credit Initiative. Still, the ground work would have been very difficult, but thanks to the contribution of Ambassador Development Agencies' financial, manpower and co-ordination efforts. In time, other bodies keen on assisting the needy such as the Christian Reformed World Relief Committee (CRWRC) also threw in their weight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To date, well over 80 Kibera slum dwellers have received KSCI loans amounting to Kshs.400,000 million (about US dollars 7,000). Among beneficiaries are water, vegetable and charcoal vendors, groundnut peddlers and fishmongers. &quot;Our biggest problem today is having to cope with the increasing number of slum dwellers who need our loans,&quot; says Munyambo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As if conspiring to complicate Kibera Savings and Credit Initiative's problems even more, Nairobi's population is growing at an alarming rate. From a mere 400,000 people in 1962, the population of Kenya's capital city rose to 569,000 people in 1969, 827,775 in 1979, and then skyrocketed to 1.2 million people in 1989. It is expected to hit the three million mark within the next four years according to the official national censors and the 1994/95 national development plan. Over half of this population is expected to live in slum areas which do not have electricity, sewage disposal systems and decent housing among other basic services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, KSCI loans do not come that easily. To be fully fledged members of KSCI, Kibera residents must commit themselves to attend weekly meetings, show willingness to learn business management skills and Bible lessons, run some small scale business and save with the programme anything between shillings 20 and 400 (between 30 cents and US dollars seven) per week for a minimum of six months. After eligible members have been granted loans thrice and re-paid each of them as scheduled, they &quot;graduate&quot; and are expected to be introduced to commercial banks by the scheme, Munyambo told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADA's senior field officer was glad to note that the scheme has had no defaulters so far. The only non-payment he cited was due to the death of some debtors. &quot;The good news is, the repayment rate is a whooping 98 per cent,&quot; he added. Perhaps this is a pointer for commercial money lenders -- the penniless, with absolutely no form of collateral can also be trusted with loans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somalia is in the throes of another humanitarian tragedy as civil war engulfs the entire war-wrecked Horn of Africa nation, amid tightening of the grip by Muslim fundamentalists over the northern half of the capital controlled by self-styled Somali interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 23, an Islamic Sharia Court issued a decree here banning day-time sale of all foodstuffs in hotels, restaurants, bars and food kiosks in the northern half of the city during the fasting month of Ramadhan which began on January 22. The decree said those found guilty of violating the order would be punished according to Islamic laws which last year included either; ailing offenders throughout the fasting period or whipping them in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decree also stated that materials, equipment and utensils used for serving food during the banned time would be confiscated by Ali Mahdi's Somali Salvation Alliance (SSA) faction which controls northern Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Immediately the order was announced, armed Islamic militiamen were seen patrolling the streets of northern Mogadishu to try and stop several small underground pubs from operating.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in the southern part of the capital which is controlled by Somalia's main warlord General Mohamed Farah Aideed's United Somali Congress/Somali National Alliance (USC/SNA), all hotels, restaurants and tea shops opened their doors and served food normally to the public, except for a few very religious men who closed their business out of respect for Islam and to protect their reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 8, militiamen of north Mogadishu's Islamic Sharia Court pounced on a music concert and arrested 30 members of the band performing on stage at the basketball playground in the city's 1st July Street. They also surrounded and then arrested the people who were watching the concert, but released them after 30 minutes of questioning, eyewitnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those detained included Somalia's top singer Mahamud Kon Garboosh, 30-year-old Binti Omar Ga'al, famous entertainer Abdillahi Amiir Rooble &quot;Aow-kuku&quot; and composer Ma'alim Mayser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two days later, the musicians were sentenced by the court to receive 20 lashes each and some were publicly flogged on January 10, triggering outrage in the divided city. Some of the women arrested while performing at the concert were not flogged after they were found to be pregnant, but the court ruled that their sentences will be carried out after they had given birth.  Musical equipment belonging to the band was also confiscated by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Band leader Abdullahi Liman accused the Sharia Court of serious human rights violations because the lashes caused serious injury to some of those punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will be forced to cross the green that divides the city between warlord Ali Mahdi and Aideed and live in the south, where we could again be penalised for composing songs broadcast by north Mogadishu radio in support of Ali Mahdi and the Sharia Court,&quot; Liman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Sharia Court implementation chairman Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Muhyadin, denied that his courts were violating human rights through the sentences, and instead accused the musicians of poisoning the morals of Somalis by performing dirty dances, an act which was not compatible with Islamic Sharia law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The self-designated head of Somali National Theater, Halima Khalif Magol also joined in the criticism and accused the Sharia Court of overreacting and violating the value of Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even in Saudi Arabia, the seat of Islam, there are folklore dancers,&quot; said Magol, a supporter of Aideed's unrecognised government. She vowed that the southern Mogadishu government will take all necessary measures to prevent what she characterised as &quot;nonsensical interference against national art by fundamentalists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Magol, who heads a militia musical band supporting Aideed, has also been accused recently of forcing Somali singers and musicians unwilling to join the clan-based band to flee south Mogadishu into the northern part of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aideed, Ali Mahdi's arch rival, formed a new government last June after he was declared interim-president of Somalia for three years on June 15 by a conference of his supporters. But other armed Somali clan factions and the international community, except Libya, have refused to recognise it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The religious developments in northern Mogadishu have been complicated by the fast-spreading civil war between Aideed's armed militiamen and those of other Somali clan factions opposed to his rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 19, at least 27 people were killed and 32 others wounded in fighting overnight between fighters loyal to Aideed and forces of rival Rahanwein clan in the southeastern town of Huddur, according to reliable sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting erupted when militiamen belonging to the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) launched an attack on the town in an attempt to dislodge Aideed's fighters who captured it on January 16, in a battle that left another 18 people dead and others wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fighting in Huddur is part of a major struggle between Aideed and opposing clan factions in the fertile Lower Jubba valley of south and southwest Somalia in the past few months. The fighting has centred around the major towns of Baidoa in the southwest and the key port of Kisimayo in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aideed, whose original power base was in south Mogadishu, captured the southwestern city of Baidoa last September in a lightning strike at the head of a column of 600 men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Huddur, the third largest town in southern Somalia, with a population of some 100,000, had been held by the RRA -- local clansmen -- whom Aideed's militiamen had ousted from Baidoa. They have made sporadic attacks on Baidoa since its capture, but have been unable to retake it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aideed has also taken the war to the southern port of Kisimayo, the stronghold of local military strongman General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan, where several heavy clashes have occurred for the control of surrounding villages. General Morgan's faction supports Ali Mahdi's faction and its alliance of former Aideed's financier-turned arch political rival Osman Hassan Ali &quot;Atto&quot;, who leads a rival faction of the USC/SNA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heavy fighting has also broken out in Somaliland, former northern Somalia region which declared itself an independent republic after dictator Mohamad Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 16, a pitched battle between loyalist and opposition forces in parts of the breakaway republic left at least 59 fighters dead, 130 wounded and the major city devastated, according to reports coming into the Somali capital through field radios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fighting in Burco, the second biggest city in the region, pitted supporters of &quot;President&quot; Mohamed Ibrahim Egal against militiamen backed by Aideed's vice-president and former Somaliland's first President Abdurahaman Ali &quot;Tuur&quot;, who was ousted by elders in 1993 in favour of independent Somalia's first Prime Minister Egal. Tuur has since become a vice-president in the Somali &quot;government&quot; proclaimed by General Aideed last June and favours reunification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although each side claimed victory, the radio traffic monitored in Mogadishu said both sides had withdrawn and the population had fled, leaving the city to freelance looters on January 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Residents were reported to be sheltering in nearby villages, but short of food, water and shelter. Burco is some 170 kilometres east of Hargeisa, Somaliland's &quot;capital.&quot; No international aid agencies have worked in this town since the start of regular clashes between the two forces in early 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somaliland, a former British colony, split off from the rest of Somalia, formerly Italian, when Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991, but it has not received any international recognition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Nairobi - The New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC) is in the process of moving its headquarters from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi to Narus, a region in southern Sudan controlled by the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association (SRRA), which is an arm of the Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/M).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to reports published in the February edition of NSCC News, some staff houses are expected to be completed and ready for occupation by the end of this month. The construction of the council's new headquarters is reportedly funded by the Norwegian Church Aid (NCA).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bulletin further reports that although the NSCC Executive Committee has not given a deadline for moving into the new offices, the secretariat was working with Bishop Paride Taban of Torit Diocese in southern Sudan on the new site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the transfer of offices from Nairobi to southern Sudan, NSCC Relief Coordinator Mr Rob Haarsager told APS, the move was necessitated by the need to be &quot;closer to the churches and the people.&quot; Haarsager noted that it was easier to get information about the people and respond faster if they worked among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haarsager conceded that the day to day running of the NSCC &quot;will be a bit more difficult because of potential insecurity.&quot; However, he pointed out that on the other hand, Narus had been secure for some time now and in any case, NSCC was only returning to a region which had previously hosted its head offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New Sudan Council of Churches, established in 1989 with the motto, &quot;Serving All God's people,&quot; based its headquarters in Torit, southern Sudan until 1992 when the Islamic government of Sudan took control of the area and forced the council to move its secretariat functions to Nairobi. The NSCC still maintains a logistics office in the Ugandan capital, Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NSCC was set up to work in areas under the control of Sudan People's Liberation Army/ Movement (SPLA/M), since the Sudan Council of Churches (SCC), located in the capital, Khartoum, was not able to contact and service the churches in the SPLA/M areas in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NSCC says it hopes to provide &quot;visible expression of the unity of Christians in the task of proclaiming the gospel of salvation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its goals, the council adds, include gathering &quot;representatives of churches and Christian agencies working in the SPLA/M administered areas for periodical conferences and counsel regarding the spiritual and general welfare of all.&quot; Other goals include the breaking down of barriers that separate the Sudanese people and the promotion of one human family in justice and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NSCC which &quot;exists to support the work of member churches enjoys the membership of all churches in southern Sudan either as full members or associate members. Its full members include : African Inland Church, Catholic Church, Coptic Orthodox Church, Episcopal (Anglican) Church of Sudan, Evangelical Church, Presbyterian Church of Sudan and the Sudan Interior Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nationally, NSCC is a member of the Sudan Council of Churches which in turn is a member of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), and the Geneva-based World Council of Churches (WCC).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cairo - Some 5,000 mosques in Egypt will be put under government control in March in a bid to prevent fundamentalists from spreading extremist thoughts from their pulpits, Prime Minister Kamal al-Banzuri told parliament on January 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out of the 140,000 private mosques in Egypt, the Ministry of Religious Affairs now controls 25,000 and will add another 5,000 this March,&quot; Banzuri said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banzuri said his government plans to focus on building &quot;grand mosques&quot; which would also hold social services such as clinics and schools.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In late 1992, after Muslim militants launched a violent campaign to topple the government, the state launched a plan to take control of all of the private mosques in Egypt at a rate of 5,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the plan, state-appointed imams run the mosques and give the Friday sermon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim militants used private mosques to spread their ideas through sermons against the state and as bases for their meetings, as well also providing social services to the poor through the mosques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banzuri's announcement came as Egyptian police announced that they had arrested five Muslim militants and broken up the biggest ever attempt to smuggle arms from Sudan to Egyptian fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zuheir Awad Salah, a Sudanese, brought into Egypt 15,000 machine-gun rounds sent by leaders of the Jihad militant group in Sudan to their followers in Egypt, police said on January 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Five Egyptians helped store the cache in the desert outside Kom Ombo, 900 kilometres south of Cairo, in preparation to distribute if for attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Security services, who had been hunting down the gang for the past month, discovered the cache and arrested the five, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the largest arms shipment captured in Egypt since Islamic militants began their violent campaigns to topple the government of President Hosni Mubarak in March 1992, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cairo accuses the Islamic military regime of President Omar Hassan el- Beshir of Khartoum of backing the fundamentalists and has announced regularly raids on shipments infiltrating across their border from Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six extremists were condemned to death on January 13 for arms smuggling.  On January 18, Egypt said it would explain to the United States its complaint filed against Sudan at the United Nations Security Council during a visit there by US Ambassador to the UN Madeline Albright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 16, Security Council members voted unanimously to condemn Sudan for not extraditing three suspects linked to a plot to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia last June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the end of closed-door sessions by the 15-member council, this month, council president, John Weston of Britain, said some members envisioned further action including a resolution against Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomats reported that Botswana was leading the non-aligned nations in a discussion of a text. Weston himself met with Sudanese Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Osman Mohamed Taha to complain about armed incursions into Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia, which sought an emergency meeting of the council, is seeking the extradition of three people allegedly linked to an Islamic terrorist group that tried to kill Mubarak last June when he landed in Ethiopia for a summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - In a major reshuffle, the (Anglican) Church of Uganda has endorsed a one-year sabbatical for controversial eastern diocese of Busoga Bishop Cyprian Bamwoze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Bamwoze who has been accused by Busoga Christians of misusing church funds, last October wrote to former Archbishop Rev. Yonah Okoth, saying he would only go on sabbatical leave if he was paid &quot;sterling pounds 10,000 as benefits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Archbishop Okoth had suggested the sabbatical as a way of easing the crisis in Busoga Diocese which had split the church into two factions, with the anti-Bamwoze group appointing Rev. Samwiri Lubogo as rival bishop.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement published here on January 28, the House of Bishops dismissed Bamwoze's demands saying, &quot;the church does not have the funds&quot; and instead directed that &quot;Bamwoze goes on a one-year sabbatical leave beginning February 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Archbishop (Livingstone Nkoyoyo) will also act as Busoga's Bishop in the absence of (Bishop) Bamwoze,&quot; said the statement, published after a lengthy meeting of the House of Bishops in the Church of Uganda western parish of Kingansano in Rukungiri District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attempts by APS to get comments from Bishop Bamwoze were unsuccessful.  His telephone number repeatedly rang without response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The action by the Church of Uganda came after a hard-hitting open letter by the leader of the anti-Bamwoze faction Canon John Nabeta on January 26, appealing to Archbishop Nkoyoyo &quot;to translate his new anti-corruption policy into action by cleaning up Busoga Diocese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Archbishop Nkoyoyo announced early this year that he would crack down on unnamed &quot;corrupt and inefficient Bishops and other church leaders,&quot; in a move precipitated by the recent change of the Church of Uganda Constitution, empowering him to &quot;take full control of all church matters. The Archbishop also said he would instill &quot;dynamism into the church by replacing over staying bishops with new ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other changes announced by the House of Bishops include the appointment of the bishop of west Buganda Rt. Rev. Christopher Senyonjo as the dean of the Church of Uganda Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Church of Uganda also resolved that Rev. Canon Evans Kisekka be enthroned as bishop of the newly formed North Eastern Diocese of Luwero on July 7. Rev. Kisekka who has been heading the Anglican Pastoral College at Namugongo near Kampala, takes over from retired Rev. Nesusera Bugimbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measures in Uganda's Anglican church were announced shortly before the enthronement of Rt. Rev. John Kahigwa as bishop of the north western Kigezi Diocese. He took over from retired Bishop Dr. Yusitas Ruhinda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the enthronement at Kinyansano Parish, Rukungiri District, where the Church of Uganda House of Bishops announced the changes, Archbishop Nkoyoyo appealed to church leaders &quot;not to look at their offices as gardens of riches but noble duties of leading people to God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The office of a bishop is not an eating house for him alone but for all Christians he is leading,&quot; Nkoyoyo said amidst applause from thousands of Christians attending the ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Archbishop decried &quot;wide spread corruption in the Church of Uganda,&quot; saying such vices had influenced increasing members of the church to join other Anglican sects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's Vice-President Dr. Specioza Wandira Kazibwe, who represented President Yoweri Museveni at the function appealed to the church to join government in &quot;forging development and unity in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The World Bank has agreed to fund a five- year programme to rid East Africa's Lake Victoria of the water hyacinth, a weed that is threatening the lake's ecosystem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) publication, Our Planet, released early this year, the World Bank will provide US dollars 20 million to rehabilitate and strengthen the management of the lake's resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 70,000 square kilometre lake, the largest fresh water body in Africa, is commonly shared between Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. Being the source of the River Nile, its waters are vital for the survival of the Sudan and Egypt. More than 100 million people derive sustenance within its basin area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rapid spread of the water hyacinth is the single biggest threat to Lake Victoria's ecosystem. The lake has more than 200 indigenous fish species, many of which could be wiped out by the rapid depletion of oxygen from its water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the Ugandan side in particular, the water hyacinth has multiplied so fast that it continually threatens to stall the production of electricity at the Owen Falls hydroelectric station in Jinja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Uganda Railways Corporation reported late last year that it spends the equivalent of US dollars 2,000 per day, just to clear the weed from the marine pier at Port Bell, near Entebbe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, plans to use the controversial herbicide 2-4D to control the water hyacinth are already raising concern among Ugandan environmentalists who fear the substance will have a massive secondary damaging effect on the lake's ecosystem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Ugandan environmentalist Asikia Muhammed says the National Task Force for the Control of Hyacinth is preparing to use 2-4D to fight the weed. He has threatened to take court action to stop them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muhammed argues that 2-4D was banned in Europe in 1993 as well as some parts of Asia and Africa &quot;because it is highly toxic to fish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says 2-4D has high persistence in the environment and was potentially hazardous to human beings since it is a cancer causing agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the executive director of the task force professor Okedi said they would contest any court action. He said his task force would take all necessary steps &quot;to minimise possible harmful effects of any methods applied for the control of the water hyacinth.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CAPE TOWN February 1 - Two members of the South African National Defence Force have been arrested in connection with the 1993 attack on a church here in which 11 people died and 56 were injured, police announced on January 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both suspects are former members of the now-defunct Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), which was absorbed into the new national defence force along with other liberation forces after the first all- race elections in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> APLA was the armed wing of the black radical Pan Africanist Congress, which is now represented in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charged along with the two soldiers will be a 19-year-old prisoner held at Cape Town's Pollsmoor prison on an unrelated robbery charge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armed men stormed the St. James' Anglican Church in Cape Town's upmarket Kenilworth suburb during an evening mass on July 25, 1993, sprayed the congregation with bullets and hurled hand grenades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although people of different races were attending the service, the attack was widely regarded as racially motivated because of the white character of the surrounding suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the dead were three visiting Russian sailors. One of the attackers was arrested and convicted last year. &quot;We never gave up. We always knew who the outstanding suspects were, but we were not able to find them,&quot; said Police Superintendent Des Segal, who headed the investigating team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 19, police arrested the 19-year-old, who has not been identified, on a robbery charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he gave a false name, the young man was soon identified as one of those wanted for the St. James' massacre. His arrest was followed by those of a 30-year-old major and a 24-year-old corporal in the defence force, both natives of the former black homeland of Transkei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The major was picked up in Oudtschoorn, in Western Cape province, and the corporal in Bloemfontein, in the Free State, on January 17. The suspects' names will be released when they appear at Wynberg Magistrates Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police appealed to the media to refrain from publishing photographs of the accused, saying that their identification will be a crucial element in the coming trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrests come as President Nelson Mandela embarked on a shuttle diplomacy to bring peace to KwaZulu-Natal, meeting Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini on January 25 and later in the day in Pretoria with Zulu nationalist leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela said he would meet Buthelezi, head of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and Home Minister in the Government of National Unity, after more than three hours of talks at one of Zwelethini's residences at Nongoma, in the north of troubled KwaZulu-Natal province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African President said the monarch had approved a meeting between Mandela and the province's 250-plus traditional chiefs before a planned &quot;imbizo&quot; -- a gathering of the Zulu nation -- in a bid to end the province's decade-old, undeclared civil war that has claimed more than 14,000 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela had already met separately over the past week with Zulu King Zwelithini and his estranged uncle, Buthelezi, after launching his latest initiative to end the conflict between followers of his African National Congress (ANC) and the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He and Buthelezi announced January 22 that they had agreed to jointly address an imbizo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Treading gently in the complicated world of Zulu politics and tradition, Mandela is being extra careful as he tries to seek a consensus between his own vision of a unified South Africa and the elements at play in the province: - Buthelezi and the IFP, who maintain their hard line in seeking autonomy for their KwaZulu-Natal stronghold; - The &quot;amakhosi&quot; -- the chiefs -- who are mostly IFP-aligned and thus divided in their loyalties between Buthelezi and their traditional King; - and the King, still a strong symbolic figure, but his power apparently reduced since he publicly withdrew his support from Buthelezi and decided to remain &quot;above politics' -- a move interpreted by most chiefs as an alignment with the ANC.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maputo - Mozambican Catholics, lawyers and politicians joined human rights activists on January 26 to express outrage at the Interior Minister's comments on deaths of suspected criminals held in police custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Head of the Catholic Church in Maputo, Archbishop Alexandre Maria dos Santos said he would seek a meeting with the minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I know the situation of prisoners is very serious. Many people held in prisons are victims of enemies in power or are victims of hatred,&quot; Archbishop Dos Santos said, warning that as long as justice does not prevail, Mozambican jails would always be overcrowded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Main opposition and ex-rebel leaders Afonso Dhlakama of the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) condemned minister Manuel Antonio's remarks about detainees and prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no government in Mozambique,&quot; he said, urging citizens to remain calm while he tried to discuss the issue with President Joaquim Chissano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister acknowledged earlier last week that prisoners starved to death in Mozambique, but he added his ministry did not have any food for them because nobody asked them to commit crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A man has to die. He has his limits. When his time is up, it is over.  He goes. It is not because they have been maltreated,&quot; the minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president of the Bar Association, Carlos Cauio, described Antonio's remarks as a plot against humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The daily independent MediaFax quoted parliament's standing committee as expressing concern at the minister's statements, saying they deserved urgent analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Immediately after the minister made the remarks on January 25, a human rights group demanded that he should be sacked, accusing him of making callous statements over the deaths of suspects in police custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In comments to the daily newspaper Noticias on January 29, Antonio said: &quot;Has the Ministry of Interior got food for them? No it hasn't. These men who die, it is really because there is no food for them. They are not maltreated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mozambican Human Rights League (LDH) said in a letter to President Chissano that &quot;a leader who makes this kind of statement should be relieved from duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The league's president Alice Mabota said that prisoners were often held beyond the legal limits of pre-trial detention and that what little food was available was stolen by officials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Kenyan Catholic Bishop Ndingi Mwana a' Nzeki has challenged African theologians to help the Church inculturate the Gospel message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Mwana a' Nzeki of the Nakuru Diocese in Kenya's Rift Valley Province, noted it is the wish of the Catholic hierarchy in Africa to help make the Gospel message indigenous to the people. However, he pointed out that such a goal will be best realised when supplemented by efforts from the local clergy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The entire Catholic hierarchy on the African continent and even the Pope (John Paul II) himself is for the idea of inculturating the Christian message. But the total realisation of the goal, would have to be realised through the contribution of the local clergy and laity in general,&quot; noted Bishop Ndingi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kenyan prelate was speaking here on January 29, at the launching ceremony of a religious book-Towards An African Narrative Theology, authored by two Catholic priests, Rev. Fr. Joseph Healey and Donald Sybertz of the Maryknoll Missionaries. Bishop Ndingi has written the foreword to the book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 416-page publication is an attempt by the authors to show the centrality of African cultures and values in bringing closer the Christian message to the African people through the use of proverbs, sayings, riddles, stories, myths, plays and songs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authors have graphically used between 300 and 400 African proverbs and sayings, drawn from 102 African languages to expound the Gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his address during the launching ceremony, Bishop Ndingi described the book as an impressive attempt by the authors to &quot;implement what the historic synod for African bishops (held in Rome in 1994) resolved to do--inculturate the Christian message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would like at this juncture to challenge the African theologians to use the richness of the book towards their goal -- implementing the recommendations of the synod, one of them being the inculturation of the gospel message,&quot; said the Nakuru bishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He stressed; &quot;In particular, this book looks at the cultural riches of African oral literature such as proverbs, sayings and stories. I hope that these examples and reflections will help African priests, seminarians and other pastoral workers to rediscover their African roots and make connections to their preaching, teaching and evangelisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Ndingi called for more research on the centrality of African values and traditions as related to Christian teaching. He said this would hopefully authenticate the Gospel message, thus dissuading some African Christians from living at the spiritual crossroad between faith in Christian teachings and the African medicineman or diviner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing invited guests, Fr. Healey said, &quot;although we have authored the book, it really (book) belongs to the scores of African elders, who committedly and intelligently narrated and interpreted the many proverbs and sayings to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have simply transmitted the theological reflections and the insights of the African people and communities,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And to symbolise the centrality of elders and the entire African communal system in the compilation of the book, Fr. Healey presented the first two copies of the book to a Kenyan elder, Peter Kiarie and a youth, Maureen Ngala respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile research work on Sukuma proverbs is currently in process.  According to Fr. Healey, a book on these proverbs will be published next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Alphabetical Collection of 6,000 Sukuma Proverbs will be the title of this book,&quot; Fr. Healey told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why the Sukuma ethnic group of western Tanzania has been selected for the intensive research, Fr. Healey responded; &quot;One of the reasons was that the group is the second largest ethnic group in eastern Africa, with an estimated 5 million people.&quot; The Sukuma live around Musoma, Mwanza and Shinyanga regions of north-western Tanzania.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thaba Bosiu, Lesotho - Horsemen, wrapped in traditional multi-coloured blankets against the mountain cold, on January 26 escorted the body of King Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho to his burial, some 100 kilometres from the capital, Maseru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of people stationed themselves on the muddy escarpment leading up to this natural fortress where his ancestor of the same name repelled a dozen attacks by Boer settlers and British soldiers nearly a century ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first part of the funeral down in the valley was attended by South African President Nelson mandela and his counterparts from Zambia and Zimbabwe plus delegations from Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The body was taken by helicopter in a coffin to the top of Thaba Bosiu, or Mountain of the Night, where the enlarged clan of the royal family numbering several dozen members waited to bury the king alongside the first Moshoeshoe, the founder of Lesotho.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aged 59, the king died in a car crash on January 15 while out at dawn inspecting his herds of livestock, with a newspaper report attributing his death to the driver who had fallen asleep on the wheel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The death of Moshoeshoe brought to an abrupt end a controversial career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> King Moshoeshoe II was a strong-willed man whose inability to accept his post-independence role as constitutional monarch brought him constantly into conflict with Lesotho's rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His powerful personality and unyielding stance saw him being deposed and twice sent into exile but through his son Letise III, also managing to engineer his return to the throne on January 25 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soon after Lesotho's independence from Britain in 1966, rivalry between Moshoeshoe and then Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan, led to bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Determined to rule above the Marxist-inclined Jonathan, Moshoeshoe was preparing to address his followers when loyal tribesmen were intercepted by soldiers. In the clash that followed, royalists were killed and Moshoeshoe was placed under house arrest and eventually sent into exile in the Netherlands in 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He returned a few months later, vowing to steer clear of politics and kept a low profile until Jonathan was toppled in a 1986 coup by military ruler Justine Lekhanya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His second foray into politics ended in disaster, invoking the fury of Lekhanya after he used his limited powers not just as a veto but as a source of legislation through compliant relatives in the junta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lekhanya banished him into exile for a second time in November 1990 and installed Letsie, Moshoeshoe's eldest son, who reluctantly agreed to take the throne at the insistence of his mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moshoeshoe lived in London until 1992, when the terms of his return were thrashed out in 14 hours of negotiations with the then military ruler, Elias Ramaema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mindful of Moshoeshoe's political ambitions, Ramaema's military junta warned that if Letsie abdicated in favour of his father they would oblige the tribal elders to elect another family to continue the royal line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On August 17, 1994, Letsie staged a royal coup, suspending parts of the constitution, ousting the democratically elected government and announcing his intention to restore his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coup, widely believed to have been engineered by Moshoeshoe, was reversed after intense diplomatic lobbying by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under an agreement with Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle, Letsie -- always embarrassed at being king while his father was still alive, was allowed to step down in favour of Moshoeshoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an elaborate crowning ceremony on January 25 last year, attended by tribal leaders and praise singers dressed in colourful Basotho blankets, Moshoeshoe again took up the throne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His reinstatement, however, did not gain universal praise among the 1.8 million people who live in the tiny mountain kingdom completely surrounded by South Africa, with many wary that he would again interfere in their hard-won democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Watched closely by South Africa, however, Moshoeshoe in the past year has been at pains to stay out of the limelight or cross swords with Mokhehle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - Zimbabwe's Roman Catholic bishops have entered the row over gay rights sparked by President Robert Mugabe, and condemned any attempt to &quot;harass, persecute or torture&quot; homosexuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe, who is himself a Catholic, faced international condemnation last year for likening gays to &quot;beasts&quot;, saying that they had &quot;no rights&quot;, and threatened to throw them in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an unusual pastoral letter, the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishop's Conference says it wants &quot;to distance the church from any attempts to institute a 'witch-hunt' or hate campaign against persons with homosexual tendencies.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The letter makes the point that the Catholic church sees homosexuality as a &quot;disorder&quot;, adding that &quot;what is not in accordance with God's will as expressed in our nature cannot be claimed as a 'human right'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, &quot;while we want to eliminate a disease wherever it exists we do not eliminate those who suffer from it,&quot; the bishops said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is therefore not right for anyone, including the government, to harass, persecute or torture people simply because they are known to have this inclination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The human rights aspect of the issue was raised in August last year when the government banned a gay and lesbian group from participating in the Zimbabwe International Book Fair, which had human rights as its theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faced with international condemnation from Western governments -- including a group of 70 United States congressmen who sent him a protest letter and demonstrators in South Africa who dubbed him &quot;Africa's Hitler,&quot; -- Mugabe, 71 was unrepentant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the American congressmen to &quot;keep their sodomy, bestiality, stupid and foolish ways to themselves,&quot; and went on to describe homosexuals as &quot;worse than pigs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pastoral letter was the latest in a series of growing uneasiness between the Catholic bishops and Mugabe's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 16, The official Zimbabwe News Agency (ZIANA) reported that the Catholic church in the country had refused to register its relief agency, the Catholic Development Commission (CADEC), under a controversial new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIANA quoted the church's spokesman Oskar Wermter as saying that Catholic bishops were unhappy that the new act, which sailed through parliament last year, gave a cabinet minister absolute powers over non-governmental organisations (NGOs) without providing any legal recourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The bishops are unhappy with the act, which gives the minister enormous powers and there is no legal redress. Voluntary organisations cannot defend themselves even if the minister receives false information. Natural justice demands that there is recourse to law,&quot; Wermter told ZIANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church warned that if it is pressurised to register, it will challenge the matter in court to determine the constitutionality of the Private Voluntary Organisations Act, an amendment of the 1974 Welfare Act designed to monitor NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe Human Rights Association ZIMRIGHT 88 said last month the act went far beyond legitimate oversight of NGOs by the government, threatening their independence and opening the way to governmental abuse and corruption. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - The wife of jailed Nigerian opposition leader Moshood Abiola has attacked the country's Islamic leaders for failing to speak out against injustice under military rule, press reports said here on January 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kudiratu Abiola, speaking here on January 21 to mark the beginning of the holy fasting month of Ramadhan, said that Nigerian Christian clerics were outspoken, but &quot;our Muslim leaders are timid and weak in their admonitions against injustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lecture was approved by her detained husband, the presumed winner of presidential elections held in June 1993 and then voided by the military.  Chief Abiola was arrested and charged with treason a year later for declaring himself head of state on the strength of the poll.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I only hope that our Muslim leaders are not sending out wrong signals that Islam condones injustice,&quot; his wife said, according to the reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She called the attention of her audience to a warning from Allah in the Koran that when God's punishment comes on a nation, both the guilty and the innocent will suffer, except those who speak out loudly against injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kudiratu Abiola urged junta leader General Sani Abacha to use the spirit of Ramadhan to release her husband and other political detainees, in order to put the nation on the path of reconciliation, the reports added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack came only three weeks after Nigeria's highest Islamic body called for the release of political detainees to help bring about a lasting solution to the current political crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A communique released by the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) after its weekend meeting on January 6 and 7, and reported by the Guardian newspaper on January 8, said that all political prisoners should be freed to achieve genuine reconciliation and a more harmonious political atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NSCIA noted the military junta's recent gesture in releasing some of the detainees, saying that such a step would help deflate tension in the country, a reference to the recent release of Chief Warieni Agamene, former president of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) who led his union in a crippling two- month strike in the summer of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others were Sylvester Odion-Akhaine, secretary-general of the Campaign for Democracy (CD) opposition coalition, and Fred Eno, a close aide to Chief Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The releases followed that of Prince Ademola Adeniji-Adele, another opposition figure, on December 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers had interpreted the releases as a conciliatory move both towards domestic opponents of the regime and to the international community, which put Nigeria in the dock after the executions of nine Ogoni opposition figures in November.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It is an inescapable fact that the South Africa-Austria Davis Cup tie which gets under way on the manicured lawns at the genteel Wanderers Club next Friday is an elitist event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while elitism in the context of this country's present state of development is a potion to be measured out with increasing reluctance, this very element of the three-day contest offers South Africa exactly the opposite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the tie is due to happen at all owes much to the sudden renaissance of the game under the new management team, which has dragged tennis back from the brink of near extinction in this country and given the sport some much-needed credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The turning point was the release on October 23 last year of the report of Mervyn King's one-man commission into the ills crippling tennis. King, a highly respected legal mind with equal respect in the business community, did the only real thing possible with the family silver having been lost, irreparably tarnished or sold off. He advised that a fresh start be made.  This it indeed has. The Davis Cup tie which tournament director Keith Brebnor aptly describes as a &quot;little miracle&quot; is one of the first concrete proofs of that.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, like the frantic preparations which have gone into ensuring that the Wanderers is a fit -- and International Tennis Federation-approved -- venue, the stands are only temporary realities. There is much yet to do in the way of laying permanent foundations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are any number of reasons why this is so, but the most conclusively convincing of them is one oft-repeated and simple statement from South African tennis's new Mr Fix-it, Terry Rosenberg: &quot;You have to succeed at the top to make it happen at the bottom,&quot; he has said on more than one occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It means convincing the private sector on one hand and the public on the other that the tournament they are going to support is first of merit, and second not staged to the detriment of those who constitute the broader base of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new management team have done much to use the elitism of the game -- and the self-evident exclusivity of the tie -- toward these ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There can be little doubt -- given the involvement of the local Davis Cup squad in clinics which form an integral though lower profile part of the tie -- that the emphasis is swinging towards feeding young players in at the bottom. This is essential when one figures on the amount of effort required before any real proficiency is reached at the game. Tennis, for this and arguably other elitist reasons, must perforce have a high attrition rate at the lower end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So said, it is as important for our seldom-seen local tennis heroes to succeed at home as it was for the more familiar faces of the rugby, cricket and soccer stars to add some starch to the collective national spine.  Everyone, so the old saying goes, loves a winner. The circle which encompasses those who achieve sporting success is a small one indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So it is perhaps even more relevant that the grass surface chosen as the arena is one which relies even more strongly on this element of exclusivity in the striving for national success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not, for example, the surface that Thomas Muster, the world and Austrian No 1, would have made his first choice, even without the added disadvantage of playing in the thin atmosphere of the Gauteng highveld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Muster took over the top global ranking after the Australian Open in Melbourne, he has been a consistent early casualty at Wimbledon ... and even the ill-informed know that the All England Lawn Championship is played on grass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But is well to heed the warning sounded by Gary Muller -- a full member of the team which also includes Wayne Ferreira, Marcos Ondruska, John Lafnie de Jager and veteran Christo van Rensburg, although not initially named by Davis Cup captain Danie Visser -- that Muster cannot be discounted on grass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Muster is a very determined character who fights to the bitter end. He won't just throw in the towel,&quot; is Muller's assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, though much has been made of Muster's near invincibility as a clay court specialist, it is well not to forget that anyone who reaches the top of the global rankings can play a bit -- no matter in how low a regard the likes of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi may hold the ranking system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muster will, like the other singles designates, play two five-set matches, facing Ferreira and Ondruska in turn. It would be an unwise head that imagined that Ferreira -- thankfully over the injuries which prompted his early exit in the second round at Melbourne -- or Ondruska will sleep easy the night before taking to the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is, quite simply, no coming back in Davis Cup. Australia, beaten last time out on the disgraceful Durban surface, have found that out, having to play their way back into the world group of the competition. A singular slap in the face for the multiple holders of the trophy in the 1960s and 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also no putting it behind you as a player and moving on to the next tournament. It is, if you like, as elitist as that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exclusive feel of the tie is echoed in the number of those who will be able to see the three days of competition live. There will be fewer than 3 500 of these in the stands and corporate boxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is little wrong with this thinking either. Tennis has a way to go before that self-inflicted stand-off between the game itself and a public rapidly becoming sated with a surfeit of international events becomes a close and lasting relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South Africans have an outstanding chance of advancing to the the next round -- and a possible meeting with the Russia squad who showed us the door last time -- here in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Victory, not to put too fine a point on it, is the impetus the game needs and will give back some of the squandered credibility the game needs.  And if this constitutes elitism in sport, more power to the arms of the South African team. Jager, Van Rensburg and Muller.</SPAN></P>

These will offer a myriad of different theories about one city's chances are better, or worse, than another's --some of it parochial propaganda, some of it pie in the sky and much of it a plausible attempt to unravel the meaning behind an extremely complex process that produces as fierce and emotional a competition as the quest for Olympic glory itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This process is presided over by the IOC, one of the most secretive and certainly one of the most exclusive groups of people in the world, whose actions have received intense scrutiny and been the object of considerable debate, much of it scurrilous innuendo. But whatever is said and whatever the unfathomable workings of the IOC, there can be no doubt that come September 1997 Cape Town will be the sentimental favourite to carry off the big prize.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is probably true to say that Rome, Stockholm, Cape Town and either Rio de Janeiro or Buenos Aires are the front-runners in the race, but some of the factors being forwarded as favouring Rome are questionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With this year's Olympics taking place in Atlanta, and those of 2000 due for Sydney, the assumption is that Europe will thus have prior claim to the next Olympics. Certainly the Games have never been away from Europe for more than two Olympiads, but this is an entirely different world to what it was even 10 years ago. The guaranteed revenues generated by television sales, which have already been signed up until 2008 for America, and a finely tuned international sponsorship programme, means that the Games are economically viable just about anywhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, no matter where they are in the global village, the whole world can consume them via television. The IOC is also ever more mindful that the Games belong to the whole world and as such will be keen to see that they visit places like Africa, South America and China. It is quite conceivable in this environment that the Olympics could stay away from Europe for a lot longer than two Olympiads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although it will be 44 years since Rome last staged the Games by the time the 2004 Games come around, the 1960 Olympics may still be considered too recent for the Eternal City to be given another chance. Of the three bidding cities who have already staged the Olympics, Athens and Stockholm, who hosted the 1896 and 1912 versions respectively, stand a far better chance in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another plus point said to be on Rome's side is the presence at the bid's helm of that wily street fighter, Primo Nebiolo, who heads the powerful International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). But while he has proved very successful in the subtle art of enticing votes to ensure he has remained president of the IAAF since 1981, he has built up a noticeable resentment among many leading sports people with his well-recorded bullying tactics and often questionable procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Particularly in Europe, where people are perhaps more sensitive to such antics, Nebiolo's influence could be more negative than positive. The bidding procedure has also been tightened up and stricter guidelines on presents and liberalities for IOC members were introduced at the last IOC session in Budapest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African block, which has formed the fulcrum of Nebiolo's support base in the past and has fallen for his particular persuasive methods, is also likely to back Cape Town if it can manage to convince the rest of the continent that its bid is truly one for all of Africa. Indeed if there is to be a European favourite then it should be Stockholm. It has all its facilities in place, and although it has opted to build a new Olympic stadium, it has a superb city environment, excellent public transport and a track record of organisational efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Athens has strong historical ties to the Olympic Games it unfortunately missed its best chance when losing this year's Centennial Games to Atlanta. Athens' sentimental pull will now have to do battle with Cape Town's far more alluring &quot;missing ring factor&quot;. Both South American cities share with Cape Town a similar lack of infrastructure and to an even greater degree, unpredictable economies. Rio also shares South Africa's unenviable reputation for crime. But the truth is that, outside Europe at least, most people see the bid as Cape Town's to lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Sandra Cress, competition manager for the football tournament in Atlanta who is visiting South Africa for the African Cup of Nations, says: &quot;The feeling among the Atlanta Organising Committee is that Cape Town will win the bid if it gets its act together. It will only lose if it messes up badly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To mess up Cape Town will have to come up short on the technical requirements of the bid and that is something which Chris Ball, CEO of the Cape Town 2004 Olympic Bid Company, is adamant will not happen. With more than 400 professional people currently working on a voluntary basis on the technical aspects of the bid, and a lot of advice and expertise from Sydney and Atlanta, there should be no problems in this department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town and the other bidding cities must submit a candidature file to the IOC by August 15 this year. These files contain detailed answers to 532 questions across 19 broad themes relating to the organisation of the Games and the facilities to be provided. How well Cape Town has performed in this task will only be known once the IOC's evaluation commission begins its work towards the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This commission, which was first used by the IOC to evaluate the candidates for the 2000 Olympic Games, will spend five days in each bidding city assessing the viability of the proposals put forward in the candidature file. It will then produce a report giving its assessment of each city on each theme in the file. The commission does not make recommendations on the choice of cities to the IOC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next April the IOC selection college, which is basically the IOC minus members from the countries of bidding cities, will then choose four of the 11 cities to go through to phase two of the campaign which is the full- blooded contest of wooing IOC members to try and secure their votes. The feeling is that if Cape Town can negotiate this hurdle the rest will be plain sailing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, there is still the small matter of convincing the Cabinet to support the bid when Ball and his team present their case in April. Without a guarantee from the government the IOC will not accept the bid and it is common knowledge that there are still some influential ministers who are yet to be converted. The crucial issue will be the funding of the bid and the level of commitment and risk for the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ball is a banker, however, and if there is one thing he is convinced about, and very good at convincing others about too, is the economic viability of the bid. If he can deliver his usually ebullient message to the Cabinet and also convey the same information to the public at large (Berlin fared badly in the 2000 campaign largely because of opposition to its bid at home) then Cape Town will be well on its way to securing the greatest single event on the planet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Once exchange controls are lifted, the South African investment community's interest in offshore opportunities will snowball, says Syfrets Group chief executive Christopher Beatty, speaking at a launch this week of new international investment products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he cautioned that investors need to react quickly to changes in the international economy and understand the risks involved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Head of Syfrets International Rob Nichol said investors should look at long-term themes in the market and structure their portfolios accordingly.  The technology revolution was one of the global themes, said Nichol, adding that South Africa is a prime example of development in telecommunications.  'south Africa uses more cellphones than anywhere else in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited emerging markets -- one of which was Africa -- as another global theme. &quot;If the deregulation taking place in these markets can be combined with political stability, the growth potential is enormous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> China with its potential consumer base of 800-million people could become a driving force behind countries in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African Breweries (SAB) recently hosted a prize-giving function for the winners of its Kick-Start programme, a joint initiative set up in May last year between SAB and youth business organisations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The R2,7-million programme provided seed capital of R1 000 to 400 aspirant business people to set up their own businesses.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> North-eastern Gauteng winner Patrick Mnisi said he planned to reinvest the R10 000 he won into his reupholstery and repairs business, which has a monthly turnover of R4 000. &quot;I want to employ another person in the business now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Trade and Industry's chief director, Dr Alastair Ruiters, said that the bulk of South African exports emanated from small companies or from joint ventures between big and small companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that SAB had undertaken to buy more than R50-million of their annual requirements from the small business sector.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa is about to enter the exclusive space satellite club with the launch of an affordable 50kg bar-fridge-sized micro-satellite dubbed SunSat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The locally-designed and built satellite will provide data transfer and remote sensing facilities for the Southern African region. The United States Space Agency, Nasa, is sponsoring the SunSat launch, expected at the end of the year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The R1,5-million SunSat 1 micro-satellite project was conceived in 1989 by Stellenbosch University's Professor Arnold Schoonwinkel. The idea was to create a pool of expertise within the university community as well as facilitate international co-operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearing completion at the University's engineering faculty, SunSat 1 is scheduled for launch at the end of the year from the Van Den Berg Air Force base. Nasa will launch the satellite in exchange for use of a portion of the satellite as a laser reflector for calibration of its Global Positioning System tracking facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project, which is being sponsored by Grinaker Electronics, Plessey Tellumat, Altech and Siemens, has mostly South African designed and manufactured components on board, and has up to 35 students actively involved in assembly and testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 15 masters students, led by Computer and Control System lecturers, began detailed design in 1992 and most prototype hardware was operating by July 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the SunSat 1 project leader, Professor Garth Milne, the satellite's &quot;payload&quot; will consist of an amateur radio transmission facility that supports worldwide activity, a high resolution, three colour CCD stereo still camera capable of resolving images at a resolution of 20m, NiCad batteries, a PAL I video camera, UHF , VHF, S Band and L Band transmitters, a horizon meter, a data storage and retrieval system, on-board telemetry and computing systems and a magnetometer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The design includes backup systems to ensure a fair amount of hardware redundancy. This includes a tele-command system for rebooting the satellite in case of failure of any of the on-board hardware systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although SunSat 1 is designed according to Ariane ASAP (Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payload) specs of 50kg mass and 45cm cube size, it is actually scheduled for launch aboard a Nasa McDonnell Douglas Delta II rocket on a US Air Force mission. It will hover in Low Earth Orbit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The satellite's casing, constructed by the university's Mechanical Engineering department, is made up of layered aluminium modules slotted on top of one another. The CCD camera optics will be supplied by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, while the magnetometer will be built by the Hermanus Magnetic institute. To save costs, the satellite will not have any jet propulsion systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although its footprint will only be over Southern Africa for 10 minutes a day, the cube-shaped SunSat 1 will be able to provide stereo colour video images of the region's cultivated fields, natural vegetation and pollution.  Already, says Milne, a commercial version of SunSat 1 is being planned.  Images captured in space will be sold commercially as cheaper competition to those provided by the French SPOT satellite. Know-how developed from the program is being exported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CCD video imager, for example, will be installed in a South Korean satellite, Kit Sat 3, to be launched by the Chinese. Milne sees SunSat 1 as proof that South Africa has the capacity to create a sophisticated micro-satellite manufacturing industry that is able to build custom satellites at a fraction of the price -- about R6-million less a micro-satellite -- compared to established satellite manufacturers such as Hughes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Nedcor's Economic Unit estimates that R137-billion will be spent on capital expenditure by the year 2001. This is 20% higher than estimates of R114-billion a year ago for the five year period to 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The general consensus among economists is that gross domestic fixed investment (GDFI) growth will continue to underpin economic growth over the next two years, but at a more modest level.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nedcor talks about a 12% growth in real (inflation-adjusted) GDFI this year and 9% in 1997. But this is off a dismally low base and the extent to which it can significantly boost economic output and lead to more jobs is limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After plunging 29% over the decade to end 1993 and from an average of 26% of gross domestic product (GDP) over 1946-1985 to only 14% in 1994, gdfi is still far from its peak. At an estimated R55-billion at the end of 1995, real gdfi is still 20% below its all-time high of R69,2-billion in 1981. It is only now back at the level of 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has, however, recovered considerably from its low point of R46-billion in 1993. Most encouraging, notes Nedcor economist Kevin Lings, is that this recovery is mainly the result of a significant expansion of capital formation by the private sector. &quot;Private sector fixed investment increased by an annualised 13,7% in the second quarter of 1995 and by 9% in the first quarter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investment by public authorities has dropped from around 23% of total investment in South Africa during 1985 to 14% in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within the private sector investment is dominated by the manufacturing sector whose contribution to total investment rose from 15,3% in 1985 to 25,3% in 1994. The contribution from financial services was 24,9 % in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Big questions, however, remain over the sustainability of GDFI growth and its ability to expand economic output and generate jobs. Uncertainty over South Africa's future is still far too tenuous for investors to commit the sums of money that will generate the type of real economic activity to meet South Africa's huge reconstruction and development demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But GDFI is, for the moment, moving in a positive direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trend in GDFI is clear. Community, social and electricity/gas/water projects are beginning to take an increasing proportion of total gdfi. They now account for 12% and 9% respectively of gdfi. Capital spending on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reconstruction and Development Programme related projects, which has up to now been far slower than many expected, should begin to accelerate as the administrative structures are now more in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, Lings notes &quot;that while capital spending on big projects will remain significant, there is meaningful evidence to suggest a sizable increase in smaller private sector projects. Spending has become far more broadly based, with capital formation occurring across a wider range of industries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fixed investment spending is an important contributor to economic growth, both directly and indirectly through increased economic capacity and improved competitiveness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Unbundling has, to a large extent, been viewed as one of the panaceas of the South African economic environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Reconstruction and Development Programme considered unbundling as a major solution to the question of competition and black business empowerment, arguing that if the hold on the majority of South Africa's private enterprises by the small number of conglomerates was broken, then the dreams of a developmental and internationally competitive economy would be well on their way to fulfilment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the halycon days of high idealism are over. The highly publicised &quot;competition&quot; debate between Anglo American Corporation and Minister of Trade and Industry Pallo Jordan, which is back on the policy drawing board, has highlighted the problems faced by the state in its attempt to intervene in the private sector.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But unbundling has become an issue beyond just the political arena. the international trend has become almost a universal quick fix solution to operational problems and the rising costs of centralised control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate is positioned in two camps, one for &quot;lean is mean&quot;, and the other for &quot;big is beautiful&quot;. The success at both ends of the spectrum resolves itself in the arguments of economist Professor John Sender, whose basic premise is that size is a question of positioning in each sector. Thus, what may work extremely well in Korea may not work for the United States in terms of either size or capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a point that Barlow's chairman Warren Clewlow makes, &quot;There is no formula for unbundling, you cannot pick up a file labeled U, and find the ultimate solution.&quot; When he rationalises the groups' decision to unbundle in 1993, he is surprisingly frank about the fact that neither the issue of competition, nor the question of black empowerment, came into the picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At that point South Africa had announced that it was embarking on transformation but had not begun to implement it yet. we were faced with the prospect of a completely different playing field. We had to be in a state of fitness to take the opportunities that would be presenting themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He further elaborates on the fears that predominated. &quot;Alternatively, if the transformation was not successful, there was an equal need to embark on defensive management, in which case our companies needed to be lean and focused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This certainly cannot be what African National Congress economists had in mind when they initially argued for this kind of intervention, and as a result their approach has become far more sophisticated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andrew Feinstein, who chairs the Gauteng Legislature Standing Committee for Finance, makes the point, &quot;The ANC policy is to introduce competition policy, this does not neccessarily mean introducing unbundling measures; our approach is not that big is bad, but that structures need to be investigated as they may not neccessarily be competitive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The argument is clear: &quot;While some groups have unbundled independently, their actions have in no way addressed the issue of competition in specific sectors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Describing the process that Barlows underwent is illustrative of Clewlow's sharp business focus. For him, the shareholders interest is the dominant concern. He points out that &quot;by the late eighties the &quot;glamour stock&quot; image of the diversified stock which had been so succesful in the sixties and seventies had waned, the nineties shareholders were revisiting their rights, and sharpening their focus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He elaborates saying that &quot;while the companies were holding their own, we were becalmed, there was no growth.&quot; The decision to split Barlow Rand into 11 groups divided along sectors, at the expense of some centralised control, (Barlows Limited has a strong centralised relationship, in terms of financing, trade, insurance and support services) has proved effective, the Barlow Share price has grown by 32%, and shows an all share index growth of 90%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was a lonely decision, not popular with the executives,&quot; says Clewlow, but in his characteristically bon vivant style, explains that unbundling is like going to a dance &quot;You enjoy it most if you choose one girl and dance with her all night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like most change management guru's will confirm, you need to have a like-minded team of leaders, and Clewlow's approach bears the theory out. &quot;I created a new team of top executives, who were all much younger and filled with fresh enthusiasm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still under observation, it appears that old ways die hard. Clewlow was unclear about precisely how many trading units Barlows Limited still controlled, even if indirectly, placing the figure somewhere between 500 and 750.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The climate of political correctness also seems inconsequential, as he glibly points out that &quot;I have no interest in colour or gender, we treat everyone the same, based on talent and ability&quot;. His pragmatic approach, which is borne out in his conviction that &quot;we are only going to be able to make good on our chances if our people are there to take them&quot;, also extends to the question of state intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The final barrier is exchange control. we have to be careful as it is a pendulum that could swing the wrong way. we do need some protection, we have to be careful that we do not destroy jobs, we need to be cleverer.&quot; Michael Spicer of Anglo American, says: &quot;There are no rules on mountain tablets about diversity or unbundling. there is no universal edict, one is judged against the market. we all have to realise that the market is no longer small and perennial, we face the hard international market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglo American is on record as saying that it is not prepared to accept any suggestions of unbundling. Spicer follows Feinstein's argument by saying that the issues of competition and unbundling are not synonymous, rather the distinction is one of corporate structure and governance. However, he maintains that &quot;It is not the role of the government to pass decrees on the structure of the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglo American's position on competition is that it will not work through the structural intervention of the state. Spicer adds, &quot;We are a small country, we need to look at models that relate to ourselves and not at international best practice. South Africa can only sustain three steel mills, competition legislation will not work by saying let's have six.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He clarifies the point by arguing that competition will only work through &quot;liberalisation, lower tariffs and foreign competition, not through artificial measures.&quot; It appears then that the unbundling debate takes its place as one of the aspects of the broader competition question, with the final word from Anglo being, &quot;We believe in diversity&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Free-standing foreign exchange 'shops' have been a common sight for South African travellers abroad, but something foreign exchange-strapped South African authorities have definitely not encouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of that changed this week when it was announced that the Reserve Bank had approved a joint venture between Rennies Foreign Exchange and a black-owned Western Cape company to run South Africa's first free-standing foreign exchange shops or bureaux.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To be run under the name of Master Currency, it is the culmination of more than 18 months intensive negotiations with the authorities by Combi &amp; Company chief executive Zitulele (KK) Combi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he had been struck, when travelling abroad, by the fact that tourists did not have to cope with long queues at banks or travel agencies to change their money -- they simply went to a foreign exchange bureau and received a fast and efficient service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With South African tourism facing a massive revival after the first democratic elections, Combi saw a gap that needed to be filled and set to work with the help of partner Bheki Tshabalala as soon as he returned home.  He ruefully admits that it has not been easy to persuade the authorities, who had long kept a very strict control over foreign exchange transactions, that this was a good idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It had just never been on the cards before and we came at them out of the blue ... they were in a spot and did not know how to respond,&quot; Combi said. But once they got used to the idea, and possibly with the prospect of the lifting of foreign exchange controls in mind, Reserve Bank officials were &quot;very helpful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rennies, the authorised representative of Thomas Cook in South Africa, has been the only non-banking institution licensed to deal in foreign exchange. It has held the licence since 1900 and has run its foreign exchange activities alongside its travel services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rennies will provide management, operational support, technical advice and training to Master Currency staff, who will all be &quot;raw&quot; matriculants, Combi said. &quot;We aim at real job creation, not poaching people from other jobs and thereby just contributing to the creation of an elitist group of people who move from one company to another,&quot; Combi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he expected to create 40 new jobs in the first five new outlets in Cape Town and Johannesburg by June this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Combi said the Reserve Bank exchange control general manager John Postmus had told him that after running the joint venture for &quot;nine to 12 months, we could make a formal application for our own licence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rennies travel chief executive Lilian Boyle said Master Currency would naturally provide direct competition to Rennies' own foreign exchange operations, &quot;but we are comfortable with that ... we are committed to creating job opportunities for others'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Master Currency will charge the same commission as banks &quot;but much less than the hotels', Combi said. Combi said several bureaux from Europe, mainly Britain, had already expressed interest in setting up shop in South Africa but the Reserve Bank wanted local firms to enter the field first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first bureau has already opened in Cape Town and provides a 7am to 7pm service, including the sale of travellers cheques and foreign cash as well as the endorsement of passports for the use of credit cards abroad.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It's past midnight at Tandoor on Johannesburg's Rockey Street. The lead guitarist of rhumba band Wenge Musica, Fi-Carre Mwamba, has just launched into an inflammatory riff. Demented hippies in rubber sandals are pogoing alongside undulating Zairois in brocade waistcoats as the tidal wave of soukous music finally breaks over Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's surprising it took so long. Music originating in the area which, post-independence, became Congo and Zaire, has been infiltrating music scenes across Africa for close to half a century, seducing dancers with what music writer Graeme Ewens characterises as the &quot;transcendent quality of its guitar playing, the poetic harmonies of the Lingala language and the most sensual rhythms'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Congolese&quot; music has its roots in historical phenomena remarkably similar to those which gave birth to African jazz. Migrant workers in the mine camps and cities of the then Belgian Congo grew into a detribalised working class, sharing and fusing their folk musics into a new sound. The tonal Lingala language became a universal lingua franca. For the traditional instruments of the village, they substituted the accordion, blown or struck bottles as rhythm, and the guitar -- this last brought into the copper-mining area of Shaba (Katanga) as a trade good from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Imported gramophones and visiting bands introduced African-American and Afro-Caribbean (particularly Cuban) styles to these early players -- although &quot;our people were being taken to Cuba as slaves long before the music came back to Africa&quot;, as the music's giant, Franco, pointed out. After the mid-1950s, in the sophisticated, seething bar scene of Kinshasa, the music came into its golden age, with big bands led by pioneers like Joseph Kabasele (Le Grand Kalle) and later Franco and Rochereau Tabu Ley, fostering a whole generation of new talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These leaders crafted what is now the typical band sound, with its three guitars (lead, mi-solo and bass) and brass and reed players -- often drawn from anglophone West Africa. A decade later, amid the political tragedies and upheavals as Congo became Mobutu Sese Seko's Zaire, the style -- vocal-led, with lyrical wordplay inspiring dazzling invention from the guitarists -- moved out into the continent and the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The music has a two-part structure. The rhumba is a slow, melodic introduction, its melody dictated by the poetry of lyrics which often incorporate call-and-response patterns. Then the guitarists take off into the improvised sebene -- the part that pulls dancers to their feet. Says Paris-based star Ray Lema: &quot;You take a phrase and you repeat it until it becomes hypnotic, until you get dizzy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current new wave of soukous, pioneered by bands like Zaiko Langa Langa and Choc Stars in the 1980s, doesn't always respect this structure. The rhumba gets speeded up -- or omitted altogether. &quot;We found that (in Europe) people liked the instrumental parts best ... So why lose time with slow singing parts when people don't understand the words anyway?&quot; asks guitarist Diblo Dibala. Technology replaces live instruments, as in the creations of studio wizard King Kester (aka Joe) Emmeneya. New dance styles, like the energetic kwassa-kwassa, subtly reshape the beat. And many of the best bands still mine folk roots, finding innovation in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A growing francophone African community, and an increasing awareness of world music on the Johannesburg club scene, created fertile ground for rhumba here. Tandoor's Paul Myburgh thinks it will make &quot;a deep impact on the local music scene. The communal spirit of the music is its most infectious focal point. Even the most sophisticated performers don't separate themselves from their audience. And the francophone community here also seems to be able to work together very effectively to promote their culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Silvia Mwila, manager of the Cadence Tropicale record store in Yeoville's Time Square, notes: &quot;We&quot;re doing much better than when we opened.  And we are selling Zairean music not just to Zaireans, but to South Africans too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sebastian Voigt of CD Wherehouse in Rosebank, however, isn't so sure.  &quot;Our African music sales are down on what they were a year ago. The world-music fad seems to be waning. Whether that will be replaced by a more solid following will depend on the development of strong promotion and outlets for African music -- and in the past, that hasn't been a strength here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CD Wherehouse carries a few of the best-known rhumba artistes, while Cadence Tropicale can provide you with recordings spanning the music's entire history. A new African record store is set to open in Yeoville's Picadilly Centre soon. There's no shortage of books, including the detailed, two-volume Stern's Guide to African Music, a comprehensive chapter in Ewens's Afrika O-Ye, and that author's brilliant life of Franco, Congo Colossus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Best of all, listen to the music (sometimes live, sometimes recorded) as part of the programming at La Fronti re in Hillbrow, Club TEte- -TEte Africain at the Bougainvillea in Berea, the Lloyd in Hillbrow, Club Maputo on Troye St, Chez Nthemba on Jeppe St, and Jahnito's Live House and Tandoor on Rockey Street. And just try not to dance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The status of traditional African crafts and artifacts in Western museums has long been a question of unending debate. Over the years it has been possible to observe, in our museums and galleries, how versions of the debate have unfolded: from arbitrary collections of ethnographic specimens to &quot;lifelike re-creations' complete with authentic huts and dressed-up mannequins; from careful attempts to contextualise by means of wall-text and photograph to the unencumbered presentation of artifact as pure aesthetic form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, no matter what the approach, finally, always, the objects on display would seem accompanied by a sense of dislocation and loss -- a sense that the process that had brought these things to this point was one that underscored alienation and otherness; one that silenced the objects and their makers. The truth is that in almost any attempt to deal with cultural artifacts in a Western-style museum, displacement and dislocation are, almost by definition, a given. However, at the Johannesburg Art Gallery, curator of African art Nessa Leibhammer has been completing the installation of a permanent exhibit of mostly Southern African art that addresses this &quot;given&quot; in remarkable ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was, incredibly, only about two years ago that the post of curator of African art was created at the gallery, alongside the curatorships of prints, drawings, contemporary works, and the mainly Dutch, French and English Foundation Collection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, far-reaching changes have irrevocably altered the nature of the gallery. One's journey through the building now begins and ends in Africa. Earlier South African painters are no longer placed only as descendants of an early 20th-century European heritage: the geography of the gallery now situates them at least as firmly as a part of a South African tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leibhammer has very consciously arranged what are now the Southern African spaces. The first is a &quot;public&quot; space (of outer garments resplendent with beadwork and embroidery, and sticks of ceremonial flourish), leading into a quiet &quot;inner&quot; world (of headrests for sleep, dolls for fertility, for initiation, for health -- the passages of maturity).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And then to two recently installed spaces -- bigger and more complex in their arrangement. And much more surprising, for what Leibhammer has done has been to juxtapose the traditional artifacts with contemporary &quot;fine&quot; art works. No visible distinction has been made as to their respective status.  Beerpot-lids and beaded aprons hang beside and in between drawings, prints and paintings. Knives, bowls and pipes share space at close quarters with sculptures, a collage, oil paintings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The images are all by black South African artists. Leibhammer's long-term project is that &quot;black voices' should document, interpret and recall the histories of the production and use of the artifacts. Most of the works either depict in some way the lifestyle that incorporated these objects, or express their ethos or spirit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the relationships that are set up are only occasionally obvious; open-ended, various and allusive, they work on many levels. And contrary, perhaps, to what one may have expected, meaning is conferred both ways: from images to objects and back again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Formal affinities are dangerous to make because they may blur rather than clarify. But fascinating dialogues occur: even a painting in a modernist idiom, such as Ernest Mancoba's The Ancestor, is surprisingly affected by surrounding pieces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cross-currents within craft traditions have always existed. Here we make the liberating discovery, for instance, that the words &quot; 500 Deposit The Lion&quot; could be judged for their pure design potential, and worked in beads.  The Ace Mealiemeal logo is brilliantly improved on, in embroidery thread, as meal-bags become recycled as clothing. Does the motif take on new meaning?  Why is it so faithfully adhered to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exhibition extends this process: we are presented with a work by sculptor Johannes Maswanganye, a carved figure of a young woman wearing an &quot;Iwisa&quot;-embroidered cloth, painted on to the wood. Is it a symbol for the artist, or is he simply documenting an object typically worn?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One artist, Bongi Dhlomo, has spoken to Leibhammer of her work. Called At the End of the Day, it is a painting of a headrest, very similar to one positioned nearby. The painting monumentalises it, like an altar or a gate.  By contrast, the real one is small and personal. But Dhlomo relates how, more than a support for the head, the headrest provided a link to the ancestors as one slept, and traditionally it would be buried in one's grave for the last long sleep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exhibition also brings new pressure to bear on the straining boundary between art and craft. In the smaller, more formal room, for instance, the presentation invites us to contemplate each piece individually, as a masterpiece. Surely the notion of masterpieces arises only as craftworks are displayed in museums? At least one of the vessels here is in fact a &quot;museum piece&quot;, having been specially commissioned -- the basket by Sabina Mtetwa from KwaZulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the larger room, the objects are stood upright: spoons, sticks, knives, axes. Their verticality emphasises their figurative aspect; they are made sculptural. And in the process, it becomes obvious that the art/craft distinction is not merely a theoretical issue for academics or curators. The very works themselves pose the question. A Mozambican spoon, for example, has an almost free-standing figure of a man attached to its shaft, that must surely impair its efficiency as a spoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In museums, by focusing on the visual aspect, a world of other factors must be excluded. In some objects, silence and motionlessness are a self-contradiction: the drum, for example, and the mask, express only sad, silent remoteness. Even the varieties of stick hint at how differently they might appear in expert hands. Because these are no mere 'sticks'. There are ritual sticks, fighting sticks, walking sticks, sleeping sticks and even -- judging by the carvings -- sticks of pure satire. We can only imagine their part in entire arrangements of gesture, speech, dress and movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So who will speak for these objects? This aspect of Leibhammer's work has begun to take shape. Avoiding the cacophony of voices that usually accompany such exhibitions -- those of art historians, anthropologists, critics, collectors -- she is in the process of recording the words of those who can remember at first or second hand: makers, users, owners, participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wilson Baloyi, son and grandson of woodcarvers, is one such informant.  He has explained the riddle of the 'sleeping sticks': travellers (on foot) would carry these headrests-with-sticks, and before going to sleep at night, the stick would be pointed in the direction of the journey -- to avoid the possibility of waking in the morning disoriented, and heading off in the wrong direction. The result of this process may lead toward a new kind of art historianship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What do young urban black people feel about these objects? For some it represents a past for which they feel no nostalgia. Others speak of anxiety about &quot;private things' on public display. And still others request to be photographed with the objects -- a repeated occurrence since the installation was completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> James Clifford quotes the poet J Fenton, who speaks of a museum in which each visitor might &quot;find the landscape of their childhood marked out ...&quot; This seems to be that kind of exhibition -- for anyone. The richness, pleasure, generosity, humour and time that the artists lavished on their work is here for the revelling in.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It can hardly be described as a blushing bride -- a hastily rouged matron is more appropriate -- but there is definitely something old, something new, something borrowed and, in places, something slightly blue about the new line-up of programmes on the SABC's revamped television channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As is the case with most rites of passage, emotion and jitters have characterised the preparatory arrangements. But despite predictions of postponement, cancellation and even early annulment, animosities have been temporarily cast aside as apartheid's former mouthpiece celebrates its relaunch on February 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three rearranged channels have lined up about 40 new programmes which will commence within two weeks of the official launch of the rainbow television station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As general-purpose entertainment channels, SABC 1 and SABC 2 will carry most of the new shows, which include magazine programmes, new drama series -- local and imported -- and talk shows. But overall, experience will supersede youth with tried, tested and tame family fare -- soaps, children's programmes, bland comedies and youth magazine shows -- ruling the roost.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglophones can take heart. Despite all the talk about multi-lingual accommodation, most shows on all three channels will be in English -- and SABC 3 will be exclusively English. On SABC 1 and SABC 2, certain slots each day are set aside exclusively for other languages, and most of these will be devoted to news and current affairs. The content of magazine programmes on these channels will not necessarily be in the anchor language. For example, a programme hosted in Sepedi will not necessarily present the majority of its interviews in the vernacular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which goes to show that old systems rarely die. They simply change their format, names and timeslots. Take the not-new-but-nonetheless-restructured Good Morning South Africa -- dubbed the world's worst actuality show -- which will now contain more frequent news bulletins (every 15 minutes), specialist slots and ponderous reflections on the racial demographics of GMSA's audience. (Trivial Pursuit players might be titillated to learn that black viewers now outnumber white viewers by five to four.) Agenda/Newsline will now be called Focus; it will be in English on SABC 3, and will alternate between Afrikaans, Sepedi, Sesotho and Setswana on the other channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There will be a few &quot;new&quot; shows (many of which have been around for years) on SABC 3, the channel which has amalgamated the current NNTV and TV.  The old and the faithful from both channels will do the shuffle, with soft Aussie soap Home and Away, America's every-auntie detective series Murder She Wrote, Cinema Cinema and The Works shifting to SABC 3, and TV1's Suburban Bliss and Beverly Hills 90210 assuming the SABC 2 mantle. So what's really new? Our Monday-to-Sunday line-up picks out some of the regular highlights that kick off during the first week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chew on WILD OATS (SABC 1 at 9pm) for a witty, incisive and irreverent look at life, love and meaningless sex in the Nineties. The series negotiates the peaks and pitfalls accompanying single life in the big city, with the action revolving around two pairs of roommates -- Shelly Thompson and Liz Bradford, Jack Slayton and Brian Grant. Great as a lightweight comedy, no doubt, but there are no prizes for guessing the plot diameter. A disillusioned young London policeman and his wife decide to relocate to the Yorkshire moors in HEARTBEAT (SABC 3 at 10.40pm), Britain's number-one drama series for over two years and one of the hottest properties in the television-ratings war. A combination of humour and drama, it features an all-star cast and promises to be one of the best new series on the box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tuesday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Court TV's Trial Story (SABC 3 at 5pm) chronicles some of the most newsworthy American trials in recent years, capturing the nail-biting intensity of the entire proceedings. Among the trials to be featured are the custody fight for baby Jessica, Gregory K's divorce proceedings against his parents, and William Kennedy-Smith's rape charge. Based on Alex Hailey's bestseller, ROOTS (SABC 1 at 9pm) will provide some painful reminders of a legacy rooted in racial exploitation. The series tells the story of a slave who traces his roots from his capture as a young man in Africa to slavery in America and finally to freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wednesday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forming an essential component of the SABC's &quot;made in South Africa&quot; marketing strategy is MEEULANDERS (SABC 2 at 7pm), an Afrikaans drama series starring Kevin Smith and Michele Burgers and billed as a love story reflecting &quot;the realities of a South African community&quot;. I have my doubts about this one but I&quot;m going to do the patriotic thing and give it a punt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not to be left off the party guest list, Bill Cosby returns with A DIFFERENT WORLD (SABC 1 at 8.30pm). Produced by Cosby, this teen sitcom is set in a college, stars sometime-singer Jasmine Guy and comedian Sinbad and offers a vivacious cast of characters and high-jinx plots. Although it forms part of the ever-increasing line-up of crime dramas emanating from the streets and sewers of the Big, bad Apple, there is some hope for the series NEW YORK UNDERCOVER (SABC 1 at 9pm). After all, it is modelled on the successful NYPD Blue and the now infamous Homicide: Life on the Streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Better late than never, the British series THE Jewel In the Crown (SABC 3 at 9.10pm) begins in Mayapore, India, in February 1942 during a time of heightened political tension for a country on the brink of transformation.  The series stars Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Charles Dance and Art Malik as Hari Kumar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thursday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CLIVE JAMES: POSTCARDS (SABC 3 at 5pm) has the eternal traveller negotiating the vice city of Miami in its first instalment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A must for lovers of British comedy and particularly of Rowan &quot;Mr Bean&quot; Atkinson is The Black Adder (SABC 3 at 11.10pm). This cult comedy series is the recipient of an Emmy Award and also stars Miranda Richardson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Friday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just when you thought it only borrowed &quot;bored in the USA&quot; shock &quot;n shlock, the SABC emerges with a refreshing line-up of new series from down under. FIELDS OF FIRE (SABC 2 at 11am) is an epic story set in the late 1930s which examines the life of a young English immigrant who arrives in Australia to escape the Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Primetime viewing is JAG (SABC 3 at 7pm), a big-budget action series modelling itself on Top Gun. JAG (which stands for Judge Advocate General's corps, an elite cadre of US naval officers trained as lawyers who investigate military crimes) comes from the creator of Magnum and Quantum Leap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saturday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Travelling, hunting -- even thinking and seeing ... these are just some of the things plants get up to in THE PRIVATE LIFE OF PLANTS (SABC 3 at 7pm), hailed as &quot;the best thing David Attenborough has done&quot;. In this prime slot, it had better be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For sci-fi buffs and cyber junkies, SPACE PRECINCT (SABC 1 at 8pm) stars Ted Shackleton -- long known for his achingly earnest role as Gary Ewing in the popular soap Knots Landing. In a milkshake mix of New York police drama and science fiction, he plays Lieutenant Patrick Brogan, a 21st century cop who gets more than he bargains for when he requests a transfer from the NYPD to the Milky Way. Be warned: this is not for the lactose intolerant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUGS (SABC 3 at 8.30pm) sounds eerily like a spin-off of the American movie Sneakers. From the man who created the cult Sixties show The Avengers, this techno-gadget series follows a group of electronic crime busters who use brains -- not brawn -- to catch nasty crooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Passions of the soul (SABC 3 at 10.15pm) is the stuff that dreams are made of -- that is, if you happen to be a Jungian disciple. This four-part documentary uses the mind-master's ideas to examine who we are, where we come from and where we are going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from a number of movie and documentary slots, and all the old, familiar programmes, that about sums up the week. As is the case with most modern marriages of the Nineties, the bedroom remains overcrowded with the baggage of the past. And once the honeymoon euphoria has been replaced by the PMT (post-marital trauma) of daily routine, television audiences will no doubt discover how much has changed at the SABC. Or, perhaps, how little.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It was reminiscent of the heady mass struggles of the Eighties. For four hours last Sunday, several hundred trade unionists listened to fiery speeches from workers and trade union leaders denouncing the government and its policy of national reconciliation as a &quot;national disaster&quot; between songs praising socialism as the only road to liberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The place -- a community hall in Tembisa. The occasion -- a memorial service for Numsa organiser Heather Hills, a &quot;trade unionist, revolutionary and socialist&quot; and full-time organiser who died in a car accident last month.  Whether it was Hills's unambiguous identification with a faction in the trade union movement who believe communist revolution is the only solution to capitalism, or whether ordinary workers are indeed increasingly angry at a government which is perceived as having sold out their interests, the mood of the meeting was one of militant socialist opposition to the new dispensation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaker after speaker rallied against the government and the Cosatu leadership (who did not pitch up for the service, although they were on the programme to speak) for allowing &quot;the bosses' agenda to determine the future development of South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National trade union leaders were lambasted for ignoring trade union resolutions and worker mandates. &quot;When we ask them to go and talk about nationalisation, they talk privatisation. When we ask them to talk about the right to strike, they bring workplace forums. When we ask them to organise a conference of the left to unite socialists, they organise a discussion amongst the right wing of the left and nothing happens,&quot; a Numsa leader from Gauteng said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others said the Reconstruction and Development Programme had been hijacked by big business who were seeing it as an opportunity to make profits while the needs of the poor were not being addressed. John Appollis, branch secretary for the Chemical Workers Industrial Union on the East Rand, said the new South Africa was a paradise for employers who could now exploit workers at will. He rejected the new Labour Relations Act as a victory for employers because workers still did not enjoy the unconditional right to strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president of Numsa -- arguably Cosatu's most well-organised and militant affiliate -- MBSA worker Mthutuzeli Tom said he had built Mercedes Benz cars for 13 years but he could never entertain the notion of owning one in his lifetime. &quot;But it took our comrades who went to government, only two months before they were driving Mercedes Benzes and living in the suburbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tom said democracy meant much more than the vote &quot;because you can't eat votes, you can't live in votes'. It was time for socialists to stop fighting among themselves and to unite around a programme which could mobilise the mass of ordinary workers to call a halt to the policies and programmes of government which favoured the rich. He bemoaned the fact that there were people in government -- put there by the votes of the working class -- who seemed to have forgotten where they came from and did not want to be called &quot;comrade&quot; any more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of speakers referred to a left and right wing in Cosatu and national Cosatu leaders were castigated for pursuing right wing policies which ignored workers' independent interests. &quot;If the stumbling block on the road to socialism is our own comrades, let us make sure we take them out and move forward,&quot; a speaker said to cries of &quot;viva&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hills was, according to a pamphlet handed out at the memorial service, hostile to the 'stalinist adaptation to reformism&quot; of the South African Communist Party and believed a new revolutionary Workers Party was necessary in South Africa. The SACP was a &quot;fetter on the working class in its struggle for emancipation&quot; and was &quot;responsible for many of the compromises during the negotiations,&quot; the pamphlet said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hills associated herself with a political programme which her detractors call &quot;ultra-leftist and Trotskyite&quot;. South African Trotskyists have existed since Trotsky broke with Stalin and the Third International in the 1930's but they have always been small in numbers and divided among themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are currently a number of South African groupings who broadly identify themselves with Trotsky's idea of permanent revolution -- the most prominent of which is Neville Alexander's Workers Party which contested the 1994 election. Most of them are active in mass organisations -- including trade unions, civics and the African National Congress itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The message they preach -- which was echoed by numerous local shop steward leaders at Hills's service -- is that the working class has nothing to lose and everything to gain by following the path of socialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the gap between the rich and poor widening every day in South Africa, and with unemployment, homelessness and hopelessness on the increase among ordinary South Africans -- despite the miracle of the new South Africa -- it's a message that is increasingly unlikely to fall on deaf ears if Hills's memorial service is anything to go by.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbabane - Pro-democracy strikes brought Swaziland to a standstill. But the grip of the monarchy is a strong one to break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Patience pays', the inscription on the back of the bus admonished would-be overtakers as it rambled over Swaziland's hills. The legend might as well be a national motto: it would explain why Swaziland is the last Southern African country not to have democratised, the only surviving absolute monarchy in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Swazi society is deeply traditional, stratified into clans of royals, quasi-nobles and commoners. Chiefs and princes rule the countryside in feudal fashion, while 27-year-old King Mswati III and Queen Mother Nthombi Twala have the final say in the &quot;non-party&quot; system of central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, that traditional hierarchy was shaken when virtually the entire workforce, led by the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU), stayed away from work. The economy came to a standstill which the private sector said cost it R10-million a day. Shops were looted and power lines, water supplies and communications were sabotaged. At least one protester, a 16-year-old girl, died in security force action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike was the longest in Swazi history. The SFTU, backed by human rights and opposition forces, put forward 27 economic, social and political demands, which were later scaled down to seven. Last Saturday, Mswati ordered his subjects back to work in a hardline speech that threatened &quot;war&quot; and accused the strike organisers of planning to overthrow him. The SFTU, which claims to represent 83 000 workers out of a total about 100 000 in the formal economy, responded by dropping another six demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said it would urge its followers back to work if Mswati agreed only to revoke a 1973 decree which suspended the former British protectorate's Westminster-style constitution.The decree, issued by Mswati's father, the late King Sobhuza II, rang in a State of Emergency, still in force, banning political parties and free political activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Answering criticism that the strike had become overtly political, SFTU secretary general Jan Sithole acknowledged organised labour had become an &quot;omnibus' movement where political activity was generally banned. &quot;We haven't, as a labour movement, shifted from our main agenda ... But our problems can only be addressed where there is democracy and accountability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sithole need not have bothered. On Monday, as ordered by the king, a large part of Swaziland's workforce went back to work, watched over by a heavy deployment of police and soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While many workers in the key forestry and sugar cane industries, as well as the government electricity and post and telecommunications utilities -- all SFTU strongholds -- continued their stay-away, the capital, Mbabane, and the main industrial town, Manzini, were back to normal after a week of near-desertion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the SFTU the writing was on the wall; it had lost the initiative.  The strike was suspended pending ratification from a mass rally, to be held this Sunday. Sithole's assistant, Jabulani Nxumalo, explained that the decision had been taken &quot;for fear of losing life&quot; and to allow &quot;effective and meaningful&quot; dialogue with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SFTU emerged tarnished. It had earlier argued that negotiations would be worthless until the repeal of the 1973 decree, as the government had time and again disregarded agreements and used its powers to prevent labour or the political opposition from participating on an equal footing. Now the SFTU was again reverting to dialogue, with no guarantee the government would abide by the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several factors spurred people back to work on Monday: many had run out of food and cash. But respect for the monarchy was equally important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Margaret, a curio vendor in Ezulwini valley, personifies both. She said during the strike she lost R800 a day. A widow caring for eight children, she could not afford that. Neither did she understand the reasons behind the stayaway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Margaret: &quot;I don't know who (the SFTU) are. I heard on the radio that they had 27 demands, but I don't know what the demands are ... We don't know, if there's change, what is going to happen. When I was born, there was the king, and there were the elders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mswati is held in high esteem by much of the population. For many, it was inconceivable that things would not be back to normal if the king said they would be. Even the strike organisers have been careful not to challenge the king directly. When Mswati accused them of plotting to overthrow him, he struck a raw nerve. Sithole made a point of denying the charge, accusing the &quot;human curtain&quot; of royals around Mswati of misinforming him about the true aim of the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sithole argued the monarchy should remain, but be constitutionally accountable. &quot;If we are talking of the removal of the 1973 decree, we are saying that the king should be elevated above politics; leave the politicians to do the dirty work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kislon Shongwe, president of the leading opposition party, the People's United Democratic Movement -- which has been grudgingly tolerated since it &quot;unbanned&quot; itself in 1992 --agreed. &quot;Take it from me, of all the organisations in the country, not one of them has an agenda to get rid of the king, but all agreed that he should be a constitutional monarch, and elevated above party politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if the king is respected, the same does not always go for the rest of the extended royal clan, which, according to one estimate, makes up about 7% of the population. Dhlaminis (the royal clan name) have greater access to government employment and decision-making positions and are often perceived to freeload at the expense of taxpayers. The prime minister is always a Dhlamini and the majority of Cabinet members, all appointed by the king or the queen mother, are royal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shongwe criticised the activities of two royal-controlled companies, started with national assets in the interests of &quot;development&quot; but now perceived to be mostly benefiting royal family members. Shongwe argued the royal companies should be put under control of central government and used for the benefit of &quot;all people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is this kind of demand which may make the royals resistant to change.  Mswati is generally held to be more progressive than most royals, but while they stand to lose privilege, the youthful king is unlikely to get much support for reforms from those who are closest to him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbabane - A late-night visit by Mpumalanga Premier Matthews Phosa has failed, for now, to steer Swaziland's young monarch towards democracy, but diplomats believe the steady application of &quot;friendly&quot; pressure from, among others, President Nelson Mandela, will bear fruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's Foreign Affairs Department remained adamant this week it would not &quot;interfere&quot; in Swaziland's domestic crisis despite calls from pro-democracy groups. Yet, South Africa clearly walked a tightrope, handing out stern advice while attempting not to come across as meddlesome.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa drove secretly to the Ludzidzini royal kraal late last Friday to tell King Mswati III and Queen Mother Nthombi Twala that reform was the only way to deal with the national stayaway, then in its fifth day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood Mswati -- who diplomats say is eager for reform, but is hamstrung by the queen mother and other royals who hold much sway -- called Phosa's office last Wednesday, asking for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa sought advice from Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who gave the go-ahead. A knowledgeable source said it appeared Mswati -- who was not threatened with stronger South African action but was told he &quot;cannot avoid democracy&quot; -- was ready to accommodate the striking workers, whose demands included the repeal of a 1973 decree banning party politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a sharp about-face on Saturday, Mswati ordered his nation back to work in a hard-line address reminiscent of PW Botha's &quot;Rubicon&quot; speech, blaming &quot;foreigners' for the country's troubles and threatening opponents with war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, also on Friday, Mandela had told the Swazi delegation at the funeral of Lesotho's King Moshoeshoe that South Africa would not intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, probably after the weekend, Mandela phoned Mswati. A diplomat said the message to the king was that he would be supported in attempts to reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The diplomat said the obvious explanation for Mswati's about-face was that he did not want to be seen to act under pressure. &quot;He wants to make the announcement himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other South African initiatives included steady &quot;advice&quot; by South African High Commissioner Walter Louw, and a pending visit by Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps threats won't be necessary. Swaziland is acutely aware of the dependence of its insular economy on South Africa: more than half of its income is derived from duties paid by the Southern Africa Customs Union, and the distribution of customs takings between the member countries is up for review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African companies, and multinationals who located to Swaziland during the apartheid sanctions era, may well relocate to South Africa should labour unrest continue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -One of Sam Shilowa's previous employers tells the story of meeting him across a picket line and being so impressed by his performance in negotiations that he suggested he be groomed for management. Sorry, said Shilowa's immediate boss: nice enough chap but he really doesn't have the potential.</SPAN></P>

He is broad-faced and big-boned, exuberant and clever. His sentences, like his vast hands, go everywhere. They will climb, in spastic spirals, to the apex of an idea before crashing down into outrage; they will meander vaguely through the savannah and then take you by surprise by literally reaching out and clasping you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the Christmas holiday he took in Cuba, he decided to stop shaving his scalp and let his hair grow a bit. Nonetheless, the image of a shaven-haired cloth-capped giant remains: working-class hero or repo man; I suspect he doesn't mind the ambivalence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Journalist Phillip van Niekerk wrote in Leadership that Shilowa's manner &quot;is far more amiable than the Mephistophelean displeasure that his predecessor Jay Naidoo was able to project&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> True enough: if Naidoo's persona veered towards the hood-eyed, scheming, commie intellectual, then Shilowa has the open countenance of a hammer-twirling worker who has just ripped off a piece of socialist-realist memorabilia; sort of retro, quaint and Scargillish at the same time (if such a thing is possible), an extra from the set of On the Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, not quite. For one, while it is true that Shilowa is the sparely educated son of impoverished Shangaan peasants who rose in the unions from the shop floor, he was never quite the on-the-beat security guard he has been portrayed as; he did clerical and laboratory work at Anglo-Alpha Cement, and then was a trainer at a security and cleaning firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, while it is true that he had to take years off school because of his family's poverty, he finally dropped out in standard nine, not because of racial injustice or political activity, but in a fit of pique because he felt he was being unfairly punished (which he was) by a teacher who is now, in fact, an organiser for the African National Congress. &quot;One weakness I have,&quot; he allows, with a laugh, &quot;is that there are times when I&quot;m arrogant, not willing to listen to reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, Shilowa rose -- meteorically -- through the ranks. But, to the extent that you could separate politics and labour in the 1980s, his base was political: it was his work in the South African Communist Party underground and his primacy in Cosatu's SACP caucus, far more than his brief history as an office-bearer of the Transport and General Workers' Union, that made him Jay Naidoo's unlikely deputy in 1991 and his successor in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He obliquely acknowledges this: &quot;Even though I grew up through the ranks, my own strong points have not always been pure trade union bread-and-butter issues. Even when I was Jay's deputy, he was involved in economic issues, while I was involved in politics. I was part of the ANC's negotiating team, I was at Codesa, and at every single large bilateral. I think it was a plus for me, as I really do understand the transition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's his strong point and his weak point; ask people about Sam Shilowa and the word you&quot;ll hear most often is &quot;operator&quot;. He is, says one senior trade unionist, 'so politically canny he can hear the grass growing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of his best friends is Thabo Mbeki, and he is one of the few who has a direct hotline to President Nelson Mandela. While some in labour see this as a definite boon in terms of lobbying influence, others doubt his loyalty to the sector he is paid to represent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let's face it: South Africa 1996 is not an easy time and place to be a union leader. After having powered the struggle for democracy, Cosatu has found itself struggling for new definition, and often seems scattershot, disparate, rudderless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shilowa himself frames the dilemma acutely: &quot;We either stand accused of being a conveyor belt and in bed with the government, or we are called spoilers who just bark at all ministers and want to exercise the right of veto over government policies.&quot; But, while he is excellent at posing the questions about the labour movement's future, he comes across as a man who does not, yet, have the answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shilowa's old comrade, Jayendra Naidoo, who now runs Nedlac (National Economic Development and Labour Council), notes that union-bashing has become fashionable: &quot;People want the unions to be like the Amabokoboko or the Bafana Bafana ...&quot;, part of a rainbow vision where we all collaborate and win the cup. &quot;But the job of unions is to take up the cudgels on behalf of their membership. It is bound to be adversarial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this context, it's perhaps not surprising that Shilowa's tenure has been troubled: he is often accused of not being able to supply the labour movement with the requisite vision, or to corral it behind the vision he has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind the scenes, though, Shilowa has in fact effected a victory in the privatisation debate: in a draft agreement with government last week, service delivery rather than profit generation was re-established as the primary function of state enterprises, and Cosatu has also convinced the government that, within reason, workers' jobs have to be guaranteed within restructured state enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sticking point remains, however, whether private shareholders may purchase equity: Cosatu is adamant they may not -- and that is a battle it is bound to lose. In the unions, Shilowa is known to be uncomfortable with Cosatu's hardline anti-privatisation position, and this is seen as further evidence, by some, of the claim that he has become too close to the new elite; that he is too snazzy, too high-flying, too politically ambitious: a unionist with gold hoops in his ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of his favourite tricks, when making an argument, is to make of his own mother an artefact: &quot;My opposition to privatisation,&quot; he says, &quot;is not theoretical, it's personal. My mum will be 76 years old this year in May. Why should she walk five kilometres to go fetch water? Why should she only know about electricity because there are power lines runing over her property to a white farm? When talking about restructuring, we need to ask ourselves, how is my mother going to benefit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He insists that his bare feet remain planted in the dry earth of impoverished peasantry. But, both economically and socially, the truth is that he is no longer a member of either the peasantry or the working class.  Whatever the card he carries says, he is a member of the new elite; recently married to Wendy Luhabe, a glam and go-getter management consultant specialising in affirmative action who was previously the first black executive of BMW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is upwardly mobile in exact proportion to the downward mobility of those middle-class leftie intellectuals who preceded him -- the Bernies and Alecs and Jays. Now they have gone to Pretoria, and the unions are run by people like Shilowa: driven, ambitious, working-class men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Shilowa does not subject his new life to particularly rigorous self-analysis, he does deal with it with a fair amount of modesty and humour.  His home, in the Roodepoort neighborhood of Weltevreden Park, is comfortably suburban rather than glamorously yuppie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a roots-nod, Shilowa has always wanted to live under thatch: he has now bought a house with a bar in the rafters (&quot;It used to belong to an entertainer&quot;) where an SACP &quot;Umsebenzi&quot; poster hangs a little sheepishly amid all the Lapalala action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sure, cappuccino is on offer, but the Shilowa-Luhabe homestead is matt-finished rather than glossy, woody-African rather than slippery-Italianate. It is emphatically not, in its style or location, Northern Suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And his criticism of the narrow &quot;black upliftment&quot; mantra, the &quot;it's our turn now&quot; coda he encounters at dinner parties, remains acute: &quot;Yes, black people are justified when they say democracy means more than the right to vote; that it means economic empowerment. But defining economic empowerment becomes a struggle, because there are those who believe it means the self-enrichment of a few, that we can produce our own black Oppenheimers.  That's rubbish ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You have to engage with people who say, &quot;Listen, apartheid benefited a few Afrikaner businesses, so surely we&quot;re justified in doing the same thing for ourselves with privatisation?&quot; They&quot;re not looking at structural transformation, they&quot;re looking at what crumbs they&quot;ll be able to get out of the situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He &quot;agrees to disagree&quot; with his wife on several issues, but they generally find theselves, both say, in the same ball park. In fact, since he's a strugglista and she's an entrepreneur, she often challenges him, he says, with more radical positions on workplace transformation, ones that advocate blazing ahead rather than slowly building consensus around big plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sam Shilowa does not balk at being sharply critical of his colleagues -- and friends -- now in government. But only once, in our few hours together, does he betray anger. &quot;If you had to ask me what is the most ridiculous sentiment, the one I hate the most, it is the one from those of our colleagues in government or Parliament who say, &quot;You don't understand! The situation has changed!&quot; They say, &quot;Leave the broader picture to us, you concentrate on shop floor issues', but then they also accuse us of being narrowly focused on the interests of our own workers and not taking the development of the country as a whole into account.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whence does this anger spring? Despite the openness of his features, Sam Shilowa is very difficult to read. I&quot;d venture to guess, though, that he sees himself very much as part of the team transforming this land, and that any hint to the contrary riles him. I would imagine, too, that he is prickly about still being treated, by the intelligentsia of the movement, as an uneducated workhorse from the shop floor who doesn't really have the wherewithal to run things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does he feel &quot;left out&quot;; &quot;left behind&quot;? Perhaps one could read the above outburst as defensive, but if one looks at the number of illustrious ex-unionists now languishing on the back benches of Parliament (remember Moses Mayekiso? Chris Dhlamini?), he probably thanks his stars, every now and then, that he wasn't on the list of 20 that Cosatu handed over for the African National Congress list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he is an intensely political -- and clearly ambitious -- man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All he will say about his future is that he wishes there to be a choice of leadership at Cosatu's 1997 congress. But there must be times when he longs to be in the corridors of executive power. Despite the knocks to his image in the past couple of years, he&quot;ll get there yet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Grey-haired, bespectacled headmaster Hennie Berg looked suspiciously at the journalists who had come to find out how racial integration was coming along at Laerskool Eugene N Marais in Naboomspruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If a child can speak Afrikaans, we would admit him,&quot; Berg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consequence of this policy is a school which remains 100% white.  Take a photograph of the tranquil school grounds where fair-skinned children play amid the green lawns and subtropical trees, and it would be difficult to tell whether the photo dated from 1996 or 30 years earlier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Northern Province town, best known as the home of the Venter trailer, is only 60km from Potgietersrus, where last week khaki-clad parents blocked black children from entering a primary school. But here in Naboomspruit, no such desperate measures are necessary to preserve the scene of racial and cultural exclusivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no racial conflict in the school or the community,&quot; says school committee member Hennie Potgieter. &quot;We are not expecting anything like what happened in Potgietersrus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says the school has had no applications from &quot;anderkleurige kinders' (children of other colours), which he attributes to the fact that black pupils do not want lessons in Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ask black residents of Naboomspruit where their children go to school, and they look suprised to be asked such an obvious question, waving a hand in the direction of the &quot;location&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is still a lot of apartheid here&quot; says one man. Naboomspruit is by no means unique in the Northern Province, where white Afrikaans schools are confident they will stay that way, and black schools are impatient for change which has not happened. In the village of Mahwelereng, effectively a township serving Potgietersrus, a patch of bare earth hacked out of the kameeldoring bush forms a sportsfield for the pupils of Nochimudi Higher Primary. Children race back and forth under the supervision of Motlatso Selomo, a sports-mad remedial teacher who describes her job as &quot;a calling&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Look at this -- track events but no track,&quot; she says in exasperation.  &quot;We could do so much if we had the facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> School principal Fikizolo Maraba is similarly frustrated about the lack of a library, science laboratories, an overhead projector -- even textbooks for the new syllabus. Selomo admits not much has changed since the days of the Lebowa homeland administration which used to run the school. Her own children attend an English-medium school in Potgietersrus, which was formerly only for Indians and which now accepts pupils of all races. She has no interest in enrolling her children at any of the white Afrikaans schools in town -- she believes it is more important for them to be conversant in English, since it is an international language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While facilities at Nochimudi may be inadequate, its pupils are still better off than many in the province, for whom school means a patch of shade under a tree. The vast gap in resources between the historically white and black schools in the province has posed a dilemma for the provincial government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Laduma Thembe of the Northern Province's education department asks: &quot;Do we concentrate on a few schools to make them equal to the (white) Transvaal Education Department schools, or do we stretch our resources as far as possible?&quot; The province has chosen the latter course, and the R253-million allocated to the department this year is to be spent on building classrooms for those children who are currently studying in the open air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Potgietersrus's Waterberg School, genial deputy principal Mynhardt Maree is busy explaining to black parents how to register their children, where to buy school uniforms, what time school starts in the morning. But he spares five minutes to explain his school's history and its mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Waterberg was once a &quot;clinic school&quot; for problem children from all over the former Transvaal, controlled by the Transvaal Education Department. Only white pupils were ever referred there. Faced with closure, it was reinvented as a non-racial English-medium school a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reborn under the auspices of the post-apartheid Northern Province Education Department, Waterberg is free from the weight of tradition. The mostly Afrikaans staff members inherited from the previous school have applied themselves to the task of teaching where education is needed, disregarding prejudices about language and culture. The idea of non-racialism has taken longer to catch on among Potgietersrus's white parents, though. Of the school's 430 pupils, only three are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the white children in the town go to schools like Potgietersrus Primary, where a video camera scrutinises visitors before they are admitted through the security gate in the three-metre fence. Inside, the foyer is furnished with elaborate riempie furniture, and decorated with pupils' drawings of endangered animals with the slogan &quot;gee jy om?&quot; (do you care?).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The principal is unavailable -- a secretary says brusquely that the school will not talk further to the press. She denies that any ugly incidents have taken place at the school. (This was the week after white parents barred black pupils from entry and locked visiting journalists in a courtyard.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is not about racism. It is about Afrikaans language and culture,&quot; the secretary insists -- a common excuse which provincial government representative Jack Mokobi describes as &quot;a smokescreen for racism&quot;. According to the provincial education department, Potgietersrus Primary is a parallel medium school, and has an obligation to offer classes in English as requested by the black pupils who tried to gain admission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Warmbaths is not the most likely setting for a new South Africa reconciliation story, but this small spa town boasts a phenomenon rare in the Northern Province -- an Afrikaans school which is well on the way to being racially integrated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They are together in the boarding house, they are together on the sportsfield -- we are a very happy family here,&quot; says Tom Beukes, principal of Laerskool Warmbad, which has about 100 black pupils among its total enrolment of 640. In other towns, Afrikaans school authorities assume -- sometimes with good reason -- that black pupils are not interested in Afrikaans-medium education. In Warmbaths, black children are attending the school in the absence of an English-medium alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beukes believes the smooth change to a non-racial policy can be attributed to the positive attitudes of his staff, and to the fact that sports competitions between black and white schools over the past few years have helped to break down the prejudices that exist elsewhere in the province. The example of Warmbaths is one which other Afrikaans schools in the province may well have to follow. With pupil-teacher ratios as high as 100:1 in some black schools in the province (the provincial average is about 45:1), no amount of extra funding is going to equalise the situation unless white schools abandon their dream of exclusivity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -The African National Congress has jilted its Afrikaner sweetheart, the Freedom Front, and is courting the National Party, not out of love, but political need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the past few weeks, the ANC has realised more than ever that it needs the NP's support if it wants its way in writing not only the final constitution, but also the KwaZulu-Natal provincial constitution. This was demonstrated last week by the panic that ensued when the NP appeared to be supporting the Inkatha Freedom Party in KwaZulu-Natal in constitutional negotiations, and the ANC appeared to be losing ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC and NP provincial negotiators were summoned to Cape Town, and the NP was told by ANC leaders, including Cyril Ramaphosa, that it had to remember that it was a party credited with democratising South Africa, and that it should not help the IFP to preserve an undemocratic state in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want the NP's co-operation in order to improve the constitution-making process and that cannot be done if we push the constitution through the way the IFP is intending us to do,&quot; said ANC MP Carl Niehaus before that meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is ironic that the ANC should feel the need to make that sort of appeal to the NP, given that its members have been spitting insults at the NP in Parliamentary sessions, preferring to use the FF to effect reconciliation with the Afrikaner community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FF acknowledges that, in the constitutional stakes, it is now second-best. Its chief negotiator Corne Mulder said this week: &quot; The ANC needs the NP more than the FF because it needs the Nats' support to get a two-thirds majority to pass the final constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is choosing a path of qualified co-operation with the NP because it wants the constitution to be passed first time round. If the Constitutional Assembly (CA) does not pass the constitution with a two-thirds majority, there will have to be a national referendum, something all politicians would rather do without at this stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FF has been feeling the chill since President Nelson Mandela's anti-volkstaat statements on the ANC's birthday. Bilateral talks on a volkstaat have failed to get off the ground, and the FF executive had an emergency meeting at the weekend to discuss the future. Corne Mulder said this week the FF would not budge on its demands for a territorial homeland.  Mandela's statements are something of a death-knell, then, given that a volkstaat is the FF's defining issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulder admitted his party had been floundering in the constitutional negotiations, partly because it lacked the experience of negotiating the interim constitution at the World Trade Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage, we have not built up the personal relations that other parties have,&quot; he said. These special relationships include the one between the NP's Roelf Meyer and the ANC's Cyril Ramaphosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulder is critical of the turn negotiations have taken, with bilaterals weaving a skein of mystery around the public discussions in the parliamentary chamber. &quot;This is shadow-boxing. We are dodging the real issues and people are just pushing papers backwards and forwards,&quot; he said. &quot;There are some problems that no amount of bilaterals are going to solve ... We need political decisions and these will only be taken if party leaders sit around a table and take them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NP chief negotiator Roelf Meyer denied this week the NP and the ANC's relationship had shifted gear. &quot;I won't say there is a change ... but there is a general will to get consensus on the constitution in on-going talks.&quot; he said. The NP does not take the prospect of a territorial volkstaat seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP can afford to be even-tempered about its relationship with the ANC because it knows the ANC needs its co-operation. The FF has run out of bargaining chips and, with only nine members in the CA, it is not a force to be reckoned with, unless it manages to attract the newly-forming Afrikaner lobby.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Among the thousands of killings which marked the townships rebellion of the 1980s, none was more tragic or, in its impact on world opinion, as influential as that of a young woman called Maki Skosana, murdered by a mob in the township of Duduza. But the chain of responsibility which lay behind her death is only now beginning to emerge in the Pretoria Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Skosana was killed on July 20 1985. She was attending a funeral at Duduza when a crowd of mourners inexplicably turned on her. They chased her across the veld, beat her, stoned her, tore her clothes off, set her on fire, put a huge rock on her so that she couldn't get up and, in front of an international audience, rammed a broken bottle into her vagina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her death was filmed by television cameras and the ghastly footage was broadcast at length on SABC TV in what was clearly seen by the authorities of the time as a propaganda triumph -- a demonstration of the barbaric savagery of township residents. The film was re-broadcast by television stations around the world, causing substantial damage to the liberation cause.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story behind Skosana's death starts early in June that year, when a mystery man made his appearance in the townships of Duduza and nearby KwaThema and Tsakane. He introduced himself to student leaders of the Congress of South African Students (Cosas) as having come from Lusaka and being a member of Umkhonto weSizwe. He said he had a supply of weapons and had come to arm the Cosas executives in the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He seemed flush with money. He said he had R10 000 for them and would pay the commander of a proposed operational unit R2 000 and others R1 000 apiece. After a number of delays the students agreed to co-operate. But they decided they would not all take part (for fear if anything went wrong it would wipe out the entire leadership), instead deputing some of their more militant members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday June 24, a group of them were collected by the &quot;ANC man&quot; in a minibus and driven off to a derelict mine in the bush. He produced two grenades and explained how they should pull the pins, count to three and then throw them. They threw them and they exploded. Duly satisfied, they returned to the township, agreeing to meet again the next night at three collection points, including a church in Duduza and a shebeen in Tsakane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The targets were to include the homes of two security policemen in Tsakane and KwaThema and a limpet mine was to be used on a power sub-station at KwaThema. At their collection points the &quot;ANC man&quot; distributed the grenades, reminded them again how to use them and left after instructing them to try to co-ordinate the attacks at midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In KwaThema, three of the students headed for the policeman's home. They were early, so they went to a friend's house nearby and waited. Then at about midnight they marched out and, as they approached the target house, heard the blast of the limpet mine in the distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first student took out his grenade and pulled the pin. It exploded immediately, killing him. Police appeared down the street and the other two students ran for their lives. It is not known what happened in Tsakane, where two died in similar explosions, or at the power station, except that the limpet mine obviously exploded prematurely. In Duduza the picture is confused. By one account a group of students was seen talking outside the church, inside a security gate. Then police were seen at the back of the premises and the students began to run. As they bunched to get through the gate there was an explosion. One dropped dead and several appeared to have been injured. The survivors ran for it, taking refuge at a house some distance away. More police arrived at the house and in a melee which followed there were further explosions in which another three students were fatally injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Duduza the bodies were left lying in the street and a large crowd began to gather. The scene was described by a local journalist, Rich Mkhondo, in the The Star. &quot;We joined about 2 000 residents who had gathered around the bodies of the youths who had died at about midnight. &quot;The most horrifying moment of my life was when I was shown the bodies of the youths. I had never before seen the body of a man without a head. Nor had I seen pieces of human flesh scattered around and people trying to put them together again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As I was trying to gather information about the deaths of the youths I noticed more hippos (armoured personnel carriers) and police vehicles had arrived. I heard residents shouting, refusing to allow police to take the bodies to the government mortuary and saying they had their own mortuaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As I ran into a house with a number of residents I felt a burning pain on my right shoulder. I had been struck with birdshot. On looking outside I saw the bodies being loaded into police vans. Some parts fell to the ground.  A person inside the house said: &quot;Look, they are throwing the bodies inside the vans like sacks of potatoes.&quot; A woman standing next to me was crying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Word began to circulate in Duduza that the mysterious &quot;ANC man&quot; had a girlfriend called Maki who had introduced him to the Cosas leadership. Her mother, Diane Skosana, was to claim later that it was a case of mistaken identity -- that it was another Maki. Whatever the truth of it, the rumour spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Skosana heard it of course -- she even went to a local priest and told him about it. But she insisted she was innocent of any involvement in the hand grenade deaths and that she was not going to acknowledge guilt by running away. She was a simple woman, aged 24, an unmarried mother with a five-year-old son, working in a nearby glove factory. She lived with her mother, a 54-year-old domestic worker, a brother and a cousin in one of those little four-roomed matchbox houses with their concrete floors and ceilingless iron roofs in Duduza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stubbornly, she not only insisted on staying in that house, but went to the funeral of the Duduza grenade victims, and to the funeral of those killed later. Apparently there was an attempt, by one or two student leaders, to get her away from that Saturday's funeral. But she refused again. And so the fury of Duduza was unleashed upon her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was not much left of Skosana afterwards. Her sister went to the scene of her death and managed to scrape up some pathetic, blood-stained remains for burial; a piece of faded blue T-shirt, a head-scarf, handfuls of earth and some broken sticks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The memory of her death, sensational as it was, inevitably faded. But it was reawakened by testimony given in the Pretoria trial of Eugene de Kock, the former commander of the Vlakplaas police assassination unit, by one of his ex-employees, Joe Mamasela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In evidence last week, Mamasela listed some of the murders for which he was responsible as a paid state assassin and made passing reference to the hand-grenade deaths. &quot;During June (1985) I was sent to the East Rand townships to infiltrate Cosas,&quot; he said. &quot;After about three weeks the accused (De Kock) was put in charge. He gave us booby-trapped hand grenades which we gave to them. The accused (De Kock) said it would be a first for the terrorists to blow themselves up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A first time for terrorists. An epitaph for Maki Skosana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) February 2, 1996 by Vuyo Mvoko and David Beresford</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Louis Farrakhan, the Black American firebrand who is trying to fill the shoes of Martin Luther King, has dreamed an extraordinary dream -- of creating a black American &quot;homeland&quot; in Africa. But, like South Africa's volkstaters, it appears that he does not know were to put it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controversial and charismatic leader of the Nation of Islam disclosed during his South African tour that he is hunting for land in Africa to build a new Utopia, with the help of more than a million black American convicts. But attempts to pin him down on the whereabouts of his dream country proved almost as frustrating as getting Constand Viljoen and his followers to define the borders of their volkstaat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the Mail &amp; Guardian finally penetrated Farrakhan's heavy security to put the question to him this week, he took refuge in Genesis:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As we read from the Bible. In the beginning was the word, and the word became flesh,&quot; he said. &quot;We still have to turn those words into flesh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confusion about Farrakhan's go-it-alone plans for Afro-Americans started before he even reached South Africa. In Libya, he apparently told Colonel Muammar Gaddafi that his dream was of a black &quot;volkstaat&quot; in the United States itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the two men had met, the official Libyan news agency, Jana, quoted Gaddafi -- who has pledged one billion dollars to fund a minorities' lobby in the US headed by the Nation of Islam -- as saying blacks would now be able to establish &quot;a black state in America&quot;. He said that, with the help of &quot;half a million blacks in the US army&quot;, they would be able &quot;to set up the biggest black army on the planet&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But by the time he reached Johannesburg, Farrakhan's dream of an Afro-American state had switched its focus to the dark continent. &quot;We have asked for territory to be set aside in Africa,&quot; he told a press conference shortly after his arrival. &quot;We were taken from Africa and brought to America and were really never asked if we wanted to be citizens. So if there was no vote taken, we have a right to Africa. This was our motherland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Declaring that the US, as well as Australia, had been built by convicts, he said: &quot;Over a million blacks are in prison (in America) right now with no future. We are saying give us a chance to teach them, qualify them, reform them and let them work out their time building a new reality ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked whether he was advocating segregation, he said: 'segregation is a forced separation, imposed by a superior on an inferior ... when two people are in disagreement in a marriage, they should try first to reconcile. When their differences are irreconcilable, the judge then will grant the petitioner a decree of divorce.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Human Rights Commission chairman Reverend Barney Pityana was due to be admitted as an attorney of the Cape Town Supreme Court on Friday -- almost 20 years after receiving his law degree. His repeated attempts to enroll as an attorney earlier had been thwarted by police persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an affidavit to the court, Pityana explained that he had not been able to complete his articles of clerkship, which he began at a Port Elizabeth law firm in 1974. &quot;Throughout my life ... I have been politically active in the struggle against apartheid. I fell foul of the then-regime ...  and was persecuted ... for my political beliefs.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pityana began his tertiary education at the University of Fort Hare in 1966, but was expelled in 1968, without graduating, for participating in a student strike. He completed his BA and BProc degrees through Unisa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1970 he was elected president of the South African Students' Organisation and, from 1971 to 1973, served as its executive secretary general. In 1973 he was banned for the first time and restricted to the magisterial district of Port Elizabeth. In October 1975 he was detained under the Terrorism Act and released five months later without being charged. He was refused permission to take his final exams for his BA while in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In August 1976 he was detained for four months under the Internal Security Act, but this time was allowed to write his BProc finals while behind bars. In January 1977 he resumed his position as an articled clerk, but was interrupted by another spell in detention from August 1977 to March 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He wrote and passed his second examination in detention -- the practical examination for attorneys. But he was re-arrested immediately after being released and remained in prison until August 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Immediately upon my release, fresh banning orders ... were served on me. These contained similar provisions to the previous ones served on me in 1973. In addition, however, I was expressly prohibited from performing any work as an employee of an attorney and prohibited from being within any area or place which constitutes the office premises of any attorney,&quot; Pityana's affidavit read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was then and is now quite apparent to me that the overriding purpose and intent of my numerous arrests and detentions was to prevent me from continuing my work as an articled clerk. Having no means of supporting myself and my family, I was compelled to leave South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pityana moved to the United Kingdom, where he attained a Bachelor of Divinity degree and a Certificate in Theology. He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1983 and, in 1988, was appointed director of the World Council of Churches Programme to Combat Racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He returned home to South Africa in December 1992 and took up the position of senior research officer in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Cape Town. In October last year he was appointed to the Human Rights Commission and elected chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pityana concluded his affidavit by saying he had always wanted to be admitted as an attorney and knew of no valid reason why he should not be enrolled. The only offences of which he had ever been convicted were under the Internal Security Act for contravening his banning orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It had been made legally and physically impossible for me to continue with my articles or even to live a normal life. Furthermore, my wife, too, was subject to banning orders which effectively precluded her from earning a living as well. I thus faced the prospect of a future of continued persecution, poverty and starvation for myself and my family and it was in these circumstances that we left our home and country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Yesterday I missed my column due to the inconvenience caused by the search of Post premises by the State on Monday night and our subsequent arrest. Today I have had no choice but assist my colleague Bright Mwape who is still recovering from the ordeal of police mischief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How do I take up the mantle of my colleague's illustrious column? How best can I treat what he so ably writes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I will delve behind the scenes of the search at The Post on Monday night. From Thursday last week we noticed police activity near and around our offices on Cha Cha Cha Road.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba, through his State House press aide had already issued instructions to police to take the paper's editors to court for writing about the President's birth at Chibambo and the alleged forged form two certificate.  Chiluba was said to be fed up with our reports and that enough was indeed enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forgotten was the fact that the problem of the President's birth did not start with The Post but with the President himself and so did the saga of the certificate. As recently as Christmas eve 1995 Chiluba failed to clear the doubt that he does not have a form two certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to Ben Kangwa's question Chiluba failed to say yes or no to the question whether he had a form two certificate or not.  It thus surprised me that the President now had courage to take Post editors to court on a matter he, himself has failed to clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps I need to rest that issue for the moment. Let me return to our arrest. I have a lot of respect for the suffering policemen at the lower ranks but not at the higher ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, the worst culprit who in my view has destroyed the police force, excuse me, the police service as it is now called is no other than the police chief himself, Francis Ndhlovu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is a political animal and not a policeman. He can not deny for instance that the current harassment of Fred M'membe, Bright Mwape and the writer was being<BR>directed from State House.  Eric Silwamba, the President's assistant spent several hours at force headquarters discussing how statutory instrument 33 which the President had just signed would be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was a lot of traffic in information between force headquarters and State House at each stage - from the initial deployment of policemen at The Post mid-morning until the actual invasion at about twenty hours, the searches in our offices and homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was obvious as we dealt with the officers on the spot -senior superintendent Munalula and chief detective inspector Mbangu, that they and their controller at force headquarters were not the final authority in the whole saga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was obvious that when they failed to find anything incriminating the next instructions they received was to effect an arrest at all cost. On Tuesday the communication between force headquarters and State House embraced director of public prosecutions Gregory Phiri, who in the evening of that day refused to accompany our lawyers to judge Lewanika on stensibly because he would be missunderstood when in fact his brief from State House was to close all legal channels to our being granted bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cat came out of the bag as it were on Wednesday when police hurriedly whisked us from Woodlands police to Chikwa court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Government has declared all matters pertaining to the Constitution and referendum prohibited and has arrested and detained three Post newspaper editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State police on Tuesday morning at 03:30 hours charged and detained Post manging director and editor in chief Fred M'membe, managing editor Bright Mwape and editor special projects Masautso Phiri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three editors are charged with two counts under the State Security Act of receiving and publishing information in contravention of the State Security Act section 4 (3) of Chapter 110, on the programme of work on constitutional reform activity and the statutory instrument on referendum; and unlawfull possession of prohibited publications contrary to section section 53(2) of the Penal Code Chapter 146 as amended by Statutory Instrument number 33 of 1996 (prohibited publication order 1996), the prohibited publications being 12 copies of issue no 401 of the Post Newspaper of Monday February 6, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 12 copies were found at The Post circulation office at the Chandwe Musonda road office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These charges were placed after the Republican President Frederick Chiluba signed statutory instrument number 33 of 1996 on Monday declaring The Post edition of Monday a prohibited publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The edition carried a story exposing a secret hosting of the referendum government intends to call in March this year, catching the opposition off guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 30 armed and plain-clothed police officers led by senior police superitendent Munalula, on Monday evening carried a 10 hour search and ordered the suspension of production of yesterday's edition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The officers were transported in a minibus, two landcruisers, and a Nissan Sentra car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They later whisked the Post editors to Force Headquaters for arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the three were denied bail and a senior police officer who was handling them sneaked out leaving junior officers who said they could not make decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three are detained at Woodlands Police Station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when contacted yesterday superintendent Munalula said he had no fresh instruction on the fate of the editors nor the operations at The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was later heard shouting at another officer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have no new instructions, so I don't know what to do, just get straight to State House and get fresh advice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prior to the operation, President Chiluba's press aide Eric Silwamba had a lengthy meeting with the police command at Force Headquaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And according to police spokesman, the prohibitive publication will not apply to other people who bought the newspaper but only to the three editors at the paper. The twelve copies of the prohibitted edition were picked up from the offices of the Post on the day before the public were notified of the prohibition through an advert in the newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By last evening, Post lawyers were still trying hard to get bail for the three editors but failed because the police withdrew from taking the matter to the courts at the last moment claiming that they had not yet finished their investigations. This was after the Magistrate had already been advised that the matter was being brought before the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Post lawyers commented that the direction from State House shows that the prosecution is actuated by malice. &quot;The force Public Relations Officer Francis Musonda let the cat out of the bag when he said that they were not interested in people who had the publication for purposes of reading it and all they were interested in were the Post staffers. This shows the bias against the Post to the extent that people are charged for possession of a prohibitted publication whilst the ink from the Government Printers presses on the Government Gazzette is still wet and no publication has been made in the newspapers.&quot; said one of the Post lawyers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia risks losing tourists to neighbouring countries because of inadequate domestic air links, a tour operator has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairman of the Tour Operators Association, Mike Harvey, has described the situation as &quot;critical&quot; and called for a quick solution to the problem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Airline flight schedules have to be in place before the tourism season begins and we have only a month and half to go,&quot; Harvey lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He named the Kafue, South Luangwa, Lower Zambezi and Mfuwe game parks as destinations which needed regular scheduled flights to boost tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Enquiries from foreign tourists are up by between 50 and 60 per cent but to make them happen we must have aircraft schedules in place and this is very important,&quot; Harvey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that ideally someone who wanted to book a flight to Mfuwe for example should be able to do it from anywhere in the world by simply checking whether a flight was available from a reservation computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harvey said the flights by KLM and British Airways into Zambia would definitely increase the number of tourists arriving into the country but domestic flights were required to cope with the expected influx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And tourism deputy minister Nathan Mangalashi challenged Zambian airlines to take advantage of the expected increase in tourists coming to Zambia by scheduling flights to tourist resorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also advised the tour operators to make sure they made adequate transport arrangements as part of the tour package before bringing in the visitors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has strongly condemned the arrests of three Post Newspaper editors and demanded that government drops charges brought against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter addressed to President Chiluba received yesterday, CPJ, an American based press freedom organisation, further castigated the government move to ban the Monday Post edition number 401 under section 53 of the penal code declaring the issue a &quot;prohibited publication.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;CPJ writes to condemn in the strongest terms the arrests of Fred M'membe, Masautso Phiri and Bright Mwape of The Post as well as the banning of the February 5 edition of the independent daily,&quot; read the letter signed by the association's executive director, William Olmer Jr, in part.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Olmer said his organisation was &quot;deeply troubled&quot; by countless attacks on the paper and called for the removal of section 53 of the penal code which government used to ban the Monday edition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the named section had contravened several declarations of the right to free speech of which Zambia was a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We believe that section 53 has no place in a democratic society because it undermines the right for free expression, guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Article 19 of the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human Rights and the 1991 Windhoek Declaration on Promoting an independent and pluralist African press, all to which, we respectfully remind your excellency, Zambia is a signatory,&quot; the letter further read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But State House spokesman, Richard Sakala, denied any knowledge of the letter saying he has not been to the office without elaborating on the length of absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the recipients of the copies were the Zambian ambassador to America, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and United States Agency for International Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And German ambassador to Zambia, Peter Schimdt said a statement on the results of the emergency meeting held by donors following the ban on The Post will be released after consultations with State House are finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will only issue a statement after the consultative meetings with State House are finalised but for now I cannot disclose anything,&quot; he said in a telephone interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was supported by United States Information Service (USIS) director, Howard Stedman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Democratic Congress, Fodep, UNIP and National Party on Tuesday condemned the government move saying it was ploy to muzzle the press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BANJUL - With only six months before general elections, the Washington Headquarters of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs(NDI), yesterday made a startling announcement that it had decided to withdraw its Banjul-based staff that was conducting programmes in support of The Gambia's transition to democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A press statement from Washington yesterday states: &quot;the NDI decision was made as a result of political developments in The Gambia that raise concerns about the integrity of the transition process and prospects for meaningful elections in July of this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement further adds: &quot;NDI is also withdrawing the field staff, because of recently imposed requirements that the Institute work exclusively through government agencies under the direction of the AFPRC.&quot; However, NDI states these requirements are unacceptable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the statement, NDI also expresses concern about what it called &quot;a number of issues that could affect negatively the legitimacy and credibility of the democratic transition process in The Gambia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NDI statement goes on to say: &quot;These include the delay of AFPRC in releasing the draft constitution and electoral law for public comment, the continued ban on political activity, the partnership of individuals appointed by the Government to carry out civic education programmes, increased harassment of journalists and new restrictions on civil liberties, such as the promulgation of Decree 54 which allows the Minister of Interior to detain individuals for up to 90 days without possible cause.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In NDI's view, &quot;these developments continue to add to an atmosphere that hinders the ability of Gambians to participate fully and freely in the civic and political life of the country during this critical period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In conclusion, the statement says that &quot;the NDI will continue to look for ways to assist The Gambia and, if conditions permit, would consider re-opening its Banjul office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The news of the closure of the NDI Banjul office came as a &quot;surprise&quot; to the Gambian staff at the Institute's Kairaba Avenue office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We came to work today(Monday), but instead of seeing the NDI international staff, we saw two officials from the Banjul office of USAID.  When we enquired about the whereabouts of the three field representatives, the USAID officiuals told us that the three international staff had gone to Zambia on a two-week mission,&quot; said a local employee, adding, &quot;We had believed what the USAID officials told us, but while we were leaving the office for our respective homes, we just got this surprising news that NDI Washington had announced the closure of the Banjul office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;So, the decision really came as a shock to us, and we don't know what our fate is going to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the staff, the three field representatives-Chris Homan, Christine Knudsen, and Adrian Muunga-were seen at work on Friday. &quot;So, they must have left Banjul surreptitiously over the weekend,&quot; he thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDI opened a field office in Banjul in August 1995, following an invitation from the Chairman of the AFPRC, Captain Yahya Jammeh, and other concerned Gambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chairman had invited them to come and assist The Gambia to return to democracy. Before opening their Banjul office, NDI sent an assessment mission to The Gambia in April 1995, and the mission recommended, at the end of its trip, that NDI could operate in Banjul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, since opening their Banjul office, NDI seemed to have had some problems with the AFPRC Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In early November, the AFPRC expelled Tanya Domi, the NDI field director in The Gambia, from the country, because she allegedly &quot;was not cooperating with the government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision to expel Tanya Domi came just four weeks after the lady had arrived in Banjul to commence work. Since then the relationship between the NDI and the AFPRC had been deteriorating. But in spite of the &quot;misunderstandings&quot;, the three field representatives Adrian, Chris and Christine were still working in The Gambia until yesterday, when NDI took the decision to close its Banjul office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDI is a well-known democratic institution which has supported the development of democratic institutions in more than 60 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDI programmes focus on the following major areas: political party training, election processes, strengthening legislatures, local government, civic organisation and civil/military relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This newspaper made several efforts to get a reaction from Captain Yankuba Touray, Minister for Local Government and Chairman of the transition programme task force, but without success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;Daily Observer also contacted the US Embassy in Banjul and sought comments from them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banjul, The Gambia - The Gambia is to host a &quot;Roots Festival&quot; for African-Americans between March and May this year when they and other Africans will revel and participate in its culture, according to a communique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea of holding a &quot;Roots Home Coming&quot; festival in The Gambia this year came from the Minister of Youth and Sports, Mrs. Amina Faal-Sonko last year. Consequently, a festival committee was instituted, and the Gambian Charge d'Affairs in Washington, Tombong Saidy, was contacted to vigorously campaign in the U.S. on behalf of The Gambia Government for the successful realization of the &quot;Roots Festival&quot; in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The communique states that invitation to the festival will be extended to a large number of guests locally and abroad, especially the USA and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The guest list is expected to include academic intellectuals, entertainers, musicians, writers and media personalities. It is hoped that a &quot;Black Superstar&quot; like Michael Jackson could be persuaded to appear at the Festival. Roots 96 is geared towards Africans in the diaspora whose heritage and origin are in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also expected that the experiences and feelings that the guests take back with them would be honest, authentic and thought-provoking, giving them a cultural experience never to be forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the festival, the guests will be entertained with wrestling contests &quot;The Gambian style&quot;, masquerades like Kankurang, Kumpo, Agugu, Simba and many others which will also expose them to the various typical &quot;Gambian drumming and dancing styles&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the local bands which have successfully juxtaposed the traditional and modern music such as Jaliba Kuyateh, Tata Dingding and the musical youths, especially great musical artistes like Abdel Kabir, Musa Ngum, Ousou &quot;Lion&quot; Njie and others will perform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The festival committee anticipates the festival centre to be Juffureh, the home Alex Haley's forefather Kunta Kinteh. It was stated that to prepare Juffureh for &quot;Roots 96&quot;, various issues must be looked into in order to uplift the image of the place, so as to create an idyllic site for the festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The communique further states that the &quot;Roots&quot; Festival is an opportunity of a lifetime and is sure to be one of the most memorable times to be experienced by many. Therefore, it is the hope of the committee that both Gambians and African-Americans will give their full support to this noble venture and make sure that the festival is a resounding success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council and Head of State, Captain Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh is expected to officially attend the opening of the festival on May 18, 1996 at the Independence Stadium. The opening ceremony will feature the Gambian National Troupe and other cultural groups in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so it should be. South Africa's players were brilliant in their victory and created a week of hype and hysteria nation-wide that has had few equals in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was, in all honesty, a polished footballing performance from a team whose discipline, organisation and commitment are oftentimes hidden under all the ballyhoo about flair, skills and trickery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa won, not only because of home advantage, altitude and all the other plus factors of being domiciled in familiar surrounds, but because they were the better team.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The semi-final victory over Ghana showed all the hallmarks of a team who had come of age on the international stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a win that came in spite of great pressure and gives great hope to South Africa's chances of a place in the Word Cup finals in France in two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What fine finishing was shown that night with superbly taken goals by Shaun Bartlett and John Moshoeu. What maturity was displayed in the final 15 minutes when Ghana launched a late counter-offensive that was so swiftly smothered. What about the way they kept possession and frustrated the much-vaunted Ghanaian midfield?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the tournaments deciding match, even if South Africa still had to win once more to take the title, and an absorbing affair at that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final against Tunisia was always going to be a lot less attractive on the pitch, although the sense of occasion certainly made up for it. A cagey, far-from-ambitious team, Tunisias style of play deserves to be banished from the world of soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They make little, if no, attempt to force the opposition into mistakes, waiting instead to capitalise on unforced errors. It is a negative approach that attempts to hide a lack of playing talent and confidence in the teams ability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa might have looked a little shaky in the early stages of Saturdays final, but in the final 10 minutes of the first half all the signs of the impending victory were there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moshoeu created at least three chances with balls in from the flank, the best one falling to Doctor Khumalo after Bartlett had headed against the crossbar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the second half the goals came, both from Mark Williams who had shown admirable stoicism after having broken down in tears earlier in the day when Clive Barker left him out of the starting line-up. There were tears again for him at the end, but this time of joy, as there were for a whole nation revelling in the joys of a second successive sporting triumph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is forgotten among all the euphoria now is how much pressure there was on the soccer fraternity to do well after the Rugby World Cup last June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soccer is always compared to its white-market counterparts cricket and rugby and its foibles and follies always contrasted with the apparent efficiency that the establishment sporting codes enjoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soccer's administration is admittedly in dire need of a good tune-up, and there are too many side and hidden agendas standing in the way of its being a well-oiled machine, but it has had an unfair deal, always being told to copy what the others do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Had the Nations Cup not been won, then the administration would have been castigated from here to Mogadishu and back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But most importantly, the Nations Cup served up a great sociological revolution with whites heading back to the stands for the first time in decades. Most commentators said it was because they were finally shedding their fears, but I think it was more because finally South African soccer was beginning to deliver a properly marketable product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Face it, league soccer and the majority of past national team performances have been mediocre at best. This event was something special ...  and people, whatever their colour, pay good money to watch that. Now maybe they might be interested in league games too, but the newcomers will quickly discover that the standard there is nowhere near the drama and excitement of the Nations Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For South African soccer to really capitalise on what the Nations Cup has done for the domestic game, it is now time to bring in the much-planned and long-discussed premier league, throw out the old incompetent dinosaurs who retard the game, and get the hype flowing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Winning the Nations Cup was easy this is the real challenge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - ON Saturday morning in Durban Sam Ramsamy, president of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa (Nocsa), will announce the first contingent of competitors for the team to the centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta in July. There will be additions to the team in sports like athletics and swimming after the various national championships have been staged in March and April, but for many sports the decision on whether they will compete in Atlanta will be made on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramsamys task will not be an easy one as there has already been opprobrium from the media over Nocsas selection policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the last Olympics in Barcelona South Africa sent 94 athletes in 17 individual sports and returned with just two silver medals. The euphoria of competing again after an absence of 32 years was perhaps justification enough for sending such a large team, but the experiences in Barcelona quickly brought home the message that this country had fallen far behind the rest of the world during isolation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nocsa reassessed its strategy of selection and adopted the more sensible two-tier approach utilised by the worlds top Olympic nations for its policy for Atlanta and beyond. This policy allows for the inclusion of potential medal winners and athletes who can be expected to reach at least the semi-finals, as well as those young, up-and-coming athletes who could win medals at the next Olympics and would benefit from the experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is with these less experienced athletes that Nocsa is looking to redress some of the imbalances resulting from the inequalities inherited from apartheid sport. This policy fulfils the requirements of the Ministry of Sport and Recreations Draft White Paper which calls for greater efforts to achieve more representative teams at international level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, this policy has met with sharp criticism in many former establishment circles. Many sports which are able to qualify via the African qualification system rather than the far more stringent international route are trying to ensure their selection for Atlanta. With the exception of football, boxing and athletics, African sport is far behind world standards and Nocsa believes that a team or athletes from this country in other Olympic sports should qualify through the designated international tournaments or achieve the required qualifying times or marks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nocsa is looking to send a more compact team to Atlanta that will meet its two-tier criteria, but exclude the type of holiday-makers that formed a large part of the Barcelona team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is against this background that the mens hockey team became the centre of controversy after winning the gold medal at the All Africa Games to earn automatic qualification to Atlanta. The dilemma for us is to decide whether we are part of the developing world or whether we should qualify via the normal international routes. However, the Nocsa executive will not make any selection decisions without exhaustive consultation with the sports concerned, said Ramsamy at the time, after he had stated that not all those sports which had qualified through Africa were assured of going to Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So what are the merits of hockey's case? Both the men's and women's team missed the qualifying tournaments for Barcelona and the men's first real taste of international competition was at the World Cup in Australia at the end of 1994. South Africa finished 10th overall after missing out on the opportunity to contest the fifth to eighth place play-off games when Germany and Korea drew their last game and both qualified at the expense of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year they won the All Africa Games which gave them an automatic berth at the Olympics where 12 teams will contest the tournament. The side also played in a number of international matches against some of the worlds top nations and held their own without being disgraced. They lost by more than one goal only twice, against two of the worlds top sides, Australia and Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the side presently has only one player of colour among the squad of 16 that would go to Atlanta, the South African Hockey Association (Saha) has a well run and very cost-effective development programme that is beginning to show results. Five of the side which finished sixth in the under-18 World Cup in Pakistan in December and six of the under-16 side come from disadvantaged backgrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steve Jaspan, president of Saha, is quite upbeat about the chances of the team being selected. I'm very positive about it and I remain utterly convinced that they deserve to go to the Olympics. Their world ranking and standard of play confirms that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first time they were in the international arena at the World Cup they finished 10th which isn't bad out of 120 hockey-playing nations. The average age of our team is under 23 and by the time of the Sydney Olympics that age will still be only 27, plus we will have younger players coming in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In terms of development we have legitimate and transparent programmes in place which are working. There's no window dressing. The players are coming through but you cant have a quick fix in terms of merit and suddenly there are seven black guys in the team. I believe that in terms of the standard of the current team and its potential for the next Olympics we meet Nocsas selection criteria, says Jaspan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa have already been drawn in Group B of the Olympic hockey tournament along with Australia, Holland, Britain, South Korea and Malaysia and judging by Nocsas stated intent with regard to selection and its commitment to consultation, it is unlikely to leave the team behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In most sports universality in the make-up of national teams is going to take time, and merit selection is going to favour those who benefited from apartheid for some time yet. As such the tasks of those like Ramsamy, who have to answer to a broader constituency, will still be difficult in the short term.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Telkom has set itself the phenomenal target of connecting five million new phones by the year 2000. They have the backing of the Telecommunications Ministry which regards widespread access to telecommunication services as central to economic and social development in post- apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the National Telecommunications forum plenary session in Midrand this week, Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Pallo Jordan said access to telecommunication services was a basic right which all had to enjoy and, therefore, the focus was to ensure an affordable service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jordan went to great lengths to explain what an enormous task Telkom faced. He said the initial target of five million additional phones by the year 2000 would roughly ensure about 20 phones per 100 people compared to the present nine phones per 100; but this in itself was a mammoth task requiring that</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 555 000 lines be installed annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few countries have undertaken so ambitious a programme. And the question arises, can we realistically expect the state to underwrite such an expansion programme given all the other demands placed on it for the immediate and medium term? asked Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jordan presented the second draft of his White Paper on telecommunications policy to the forum. He said the paper would be ready for Cabinet presentation before the Easter recess which would once approved by parliament as the Telecommunications Act ensure Telkom some degree of exclusivity with competition phased in gradually. Telkom, in the next four years, could build and expand its infrastructure in the country with no local nor international competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The heated debate surrounding Telkoms ownership has been put on hold, pending the outcome of the states assets restructuring in the Ministry of Public Enterprises. Organised labour feels Telkom should remain wholly state-owned while the rest of the plenary was in favour of a strategic equity partnership where an international partner and/or private company bought some of Telkoms shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government is contemplating placing only a minority stake of Telkom on the market, while state control would be retained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equity restructuring was not a euphemism for privatisation, said Jordan, adding it was beyond dispute that a massive injection of money, skills and international experience was needed if Telkom was to achieve its objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said trade unions feared equity restructuring would lead to job losses but this notion was misplaced as the demand for telephones would mean production levels would increase, resulting in massive job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there was great merit in the argument that Telkom should remain under public ownership and control, dogmatic statements grounded on new-right political agendas would not strengthen this argument, Jordan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Skills in manufacturing telecommunication equipment had to be continually developed and enhanced within the sector, if it was to become economically viable locally and in neighbouring countries, Jordan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These outside challenges facing the sector came at a time when it was undergoing massive transformation and there was a growing merger between tele-communications, broadcasting and information technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa was in the ironic dilemma of engaging in nation-building when nations were facing the dilemma of globalisation, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shape of things to come is discernable in international satellite broadcasting and the globalisation of the electronic media, Jordan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Being a developing country, South Africa did not always have readily available sources of capital for investment to take account of these developments and it was, therefore, perhaps inevitable that pressures were being placed on government to throw open the door to international competition and private sector investment in the telecommunications sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some issues included as points of debate in the second draft of the White Paper are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l The shape and function of a proposed universal service agency whose key function would be to maintain a universal service at the heart of the telecommunications policy, and to build close-links with community-based organisations in public and private domains in a bid to develop capable public relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Market structure in the telecommunications sector which concentrates on an accelerated development and which takes into account technological and international trends. The new market structure which encourages a four year period of exclusivity for Telkom would be seriously compromised if Telkom is unable to access sufficient funds. At present, there is a deadlock with labour with regards to equity restructuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Establishing an independent telecommunications regulatory authority the South African Telecommunications Regulatory Authority to regulate the activities of Telkom in conjunction with the minister and to stimulate investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To stimulate innovation in the telecommunications sector, with a view to building an information superhighway in South Africa, and to promote a competitive and effective manufacturing and supply industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - With cellular telephones now virtually passe, satellite television is set to become the next yuppie symbol. Behind the scenes an intriguing corporate battle is unfolding between M-Nets Multichoice and SABC.  There is potential for substantial losers and winners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The big question is whether SABC's decision to go analogue makes commercial sense in a world moving towards digital technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Multichoice is confident SABC will fall behind and that it has already lost the broadcast rights to key stations and programmes. SABC is betting it will be able to enter the digital world with better and cheaper technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four months into its launch of digital TV, Multichoice claims 14 000 subscribers (some dealers feel it could be less) and is confident of reaching its 100 000-target by year-end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After initial problems 26 000 decoders have been distributed by Pace.  Panasonic decoders, whose production was hit by a fire in December, will be back in business in April and cost R4 300 against R3 999 for a Pace. Add to this about R700 for a dish and R300 for installation and the total is R5 000 to R5 300. The monthly subscription is R175.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far 19 TV channels and three audio channels are on-air at Multichoice. Among the TV bouquet are news channels BBC, CNN and Sky on a 24-hour basis. On the audio channels, 702 tuned in last week. The other channels are the BBC, Voice of America and DMX, which offers 40 musical sub-channels. Multichoice is talking of 30 TV channels by the end of the year. The next channels to be launched are a science-fiction one and its first optional-cost channel Zee-TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Niddrie, manager in charge of SABC's TV satellite project, expects the free-to-air rebroadcasts of SABC's three channels, extended in the second quarter, to include an entertainment/information channel (ultimately with 20% local content) and possibly an open democracy channel that will cover public institutions such as parliament, provincial legislatures, the courts, the Truth Commission and even public hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the third quarter, six pay channels are expected to be launched general entertainment, family entertainment (with four hours Afrikaans TV as an additional subscription), music, news, movies and sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cost of the analogue package _ decoder, dish and installation is expected to be R1 800 (most dishes are compatible with analogue and digital).  The monthly subscription will be R75 for four channels, an additional R35 for the movie and sports channels and another R35 for the Afrikaans broadcasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SABC projects one million decoders will be sold within three years, of which analogue will comprise 800 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Niddrie defends the public broadcasters decision to go analogue.  Analogue will be around for a long time yet. He notes that Rupert Murdoch will retain analogue technology in Britain to the end of the century. As the worlds largest owner of pay-TV this must say something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He notes that pay-TV sells around movies, sport and pornography. Of these, neither SABC nor Multichoice offers pornography. He suggests SABC will be stronger than Multichoice in sport and feels that in movies the SABC can tie up very competitive packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So when will SABC go digital? This depends when it becomes cost effective to the consumer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Multichoice does not think prices will drop. So this could take some time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Chris Liebenberg, the Minister of Finance, has primed the markets for an overrun on the budget deficit to about 6% of gross domestic product (GDP) this year. Longer term, his aim is to trim it by half a percentage point annually to reach 4,5% by 1999. But, argue some economists, that may be too little, too late to offset an explosion in the public debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given that the government is committed to reducing the national debt and to that end pursuing a cautious and fiscally responsible course, such accusations are misplaced, says Maria Ramos, the deputy director general of finance. By cutting the budget deficit, we are adding less to the overall debt levels every year, she says, so fears of a public debt trap are exaggerated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crux of the argument is whether the governments outlay adds to the countrys asset base or goes on current spending. Investment in education, healthcare and infrastructure adds value; bloated government bureaucracy, however, is wasteful. South Africa, says Adam Jacobs, economist at Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa), must become more productive: we cannot spend more than we earn. And while the government is under increasing pressure to spend now, future generations will suffer if the national debt spirals out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On international comparisons, South Africa, with public debt running at about 58% of GDP, is not the worst offender. The Maastricht conditions for European monetary and economic union set an upper limit of 60%: Belgium, Italy, Greece and Ireland all exceed that by significant margins. But Europes mavericks can take comfort in relatively low short-term interest rates, thereby reducing the roll-over effect on the cumulative debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's debt has increased at an alarming rate: from a level of 38% in 1988 to an estimated 58% this year. Whats worse is the increase ha coincided with a period of strong growth. During an upswing the total debt should decline as the rate of addition to the debt rises at a slower pace than the increase in GDP. That's the theory at least. In reality, revenue collection is poor, so taxation receipts have not improved in line with expectations; and the transition phase has placed an additional burden on the fiscus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peter Hilsen-Rath, economist at Syfrets, believes that as long as expenditure is efficient, with marginal benefits outweighing the marginal costs of debt, it will add economic value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, spending on education, healthcare, housing and infrastructure all add to the public good and the rewards will be reaped in the longer term.  Present government expenditure is on a downward, or even flat, trajectory, while investment is increasing, which augurs well for future productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others are not so sanguine. Edward Osborne of Edey Rogers &amp; Company says the effect of the interest bill growing at a higher rate than GDP is exponential: more and more money must be raised to fill the gap. As South Africa suffers from a constrained tax base, with limited revenue resources, the odds are against the state running a surplus in the short term. And even if the budget deficit were reduced to 4,5% of GDP, the core surplus would not be sufficient to offset the exponential growth of the interest element. The result a public debt trap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the long term, the only way out is growth: greater efficiency, increased productivity, improved competitiveness. The parameters are in place, says Dennis Dykes, chief economist of Nedcor. The government is pursuing the correct policies to attract investment, local and foreign, and to broaden capacity and increase the tax base growing the pie, in other words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramos concurs: The fundamentals are very positive, but our targets must reflect reality we cannot achieve everything at once. Our first priority is expanding economic capacity to ensure that growth does not peter out in the next few years. That does not mean were being complacent about the public debt quite the reverse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Faced with shrinking margins, not everyone welcomes the return of multi-national information technology (IT) companies to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The re-entry of major IT companies is proving to be a mixed blessing for some local hardware and software distributors. Some say that local users might have to start forking out more for what they refer to as the supposed benefit of direct representation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the sanctions era, many hardware and software products were imported unofficially by local companies. In most cases they acted as de facto flag-waver local representatives. But because of South Africas classification as one of the worlds top 10 emerging IT Markets, 1994/1995 saw a dramatic rise in the influx of the worlds top IT companies. Over 20 have opened up local subsidiaries or marketing offices in the past three years, in many cases in co-operation with local stakeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But not everybody is welcoming this increased representation with open arms. The flag-waver distributors have been the hardest hit by a trend towards appointment of multiple distributors for the same products. The formation of a local subsidiary of an international company often brings with it increased pricing, slower shipping of products and complicated support, says Neil Rex, managing director of Drive Control Corporation (DCC). A local subsidiary invariably adds another tier to a companys operations. Customers will have to bear the brunt of paying for the costs of that extra tier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the hardware sector, some sceptics say, product support could be a major problem as end-users are forced to go through an extra link in the support chain, which could mean they do not get results as rapidly as they should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local support policies for hardware products have changed dramatically in recent months: on-site support covered by an average 5% price premium on built-up systems is now the norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the software distribution sector, increases in the number of authorised distributors has meant better pricing for end-users, but depressed margins for distributors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some distributors are also concerned at the challenges posed by direct marketers such as Dell SA, which bypass traditional distributors by selling desktop and notebook computer systems through mail-order catalogues. IBM in the US has also begun selling direct, although it is not clear at this stage whether IBM SA will follow suit. Many distributors see this trend as a major threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are not honouring the (distribution) channel and see no reason to support it, says Dave Rule, marketing director of Hi-Technology Group. It does not do the local distribution industry any good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others, however, including Mustek director Ernest Walker, are more philosophical about the challenge, relying on their dealers for continued support. Our product range is superb and we have a large market share which we aim to increase. Time will tell.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - While Gauteng-based Pepsi is planning to set up at least five new bottling plants by the year 2000 in its bid to go national, market leader Coca-Cola may be looking to consolidate its franchised bottling operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Peter Laycock, regional manager of Coca-Cola in South Africa: There may be changes within the ownership of certain operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says the operation of its 34 bottling plants is highly capital intensive as the plants are not running at full capacity. Were always looking at ways to reduce costs and there may be an opportunity to consolidate operations and perhaps set up large warehouses close to the market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pepsis marketing and new business development manager Alan Hunking says despite the fierce competition between the two beverage manufacturers, South Africa has not yet experienced a cola war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The so-called war is only really likely to get started once Pepsi goes national expected to happen in late 1997. Hunking says plans for new bottling plants will be announced later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, the company, through its joint venture with bottler and distributor New Age Beverages, operates only in Gauteng although a new plant at an estimated R100-million is being built in KwaZulu-Natal and is due for commissioning in the third quarter of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hunking estimates between five and 10 new bottling plants will be built in South Africa by 2000 and says the company is also in discussion with a number of Southern African countries to build plants there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coca-Cola last week announced a 13% increase in its Africa Group operating income and an increase in the continents unit case volume sales of 9% for 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's R6,5-billion carbonated soft drink market is small compared to its major trading partners but there is potential for growth in terms of per capita consumption of soft drinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africans consume an estimated 170 eight-ounce soft drink servings a person a year compared with the United States where almost 700 servings a person are consumed a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A beverage analyst estimates Pepsis total market share at around 8%. In specific areas like Soweto where aggressive marketing has taken place, Pepsis share could be as high as 45%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes with Pepsi s new plant coming on stream, its share of the market could level out at about 20% in two to three years time, with Coke dropping from its present 85% to about 75%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while cola makers vie for market share, many South Africans remain loyal to tea, with some 19 000 tons of fresh tea consumed a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tea Council of South Africa chairman Michael Cherry says consumption per cup has increased, but the number of tons consumed has remained stable. The trend towards tea-bagged tea means less tea is used to make a cup than previously.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - After years of neglect, the African mining industry is attracting unprecedented attention from as far afield as North America and Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was borne out strongly this week as more than 500 delegates from Africa and elsewhere turned up for the first annual Investing in African Mining Conference/Indaba in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reason for this interest was spelt out by delegate after delegate African countries had largely abandoned their various failed post- colonial economic experiments, had knuckled down to serious economic reforms and were becoming less regulated and more investor friendly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They warned, however, that this trend had to continue and had to be accompanied by political stability and a lack of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For their part, African mining ministers said they had heard the message and spelt out what they had done, and would continue to do, to attract investment. About 30 African countries have made significant changes to their mining investment codes over the last 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Financial advisers attending the conference confirmed the increasing popularity of Africa as an investment destination but warned that there was still a long way to go until Africa was as ppular as the booming South East Asian markets, despite its enormous reserves of untapped wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The economic tigers of South-East Asia and the rapidly developing economies of Latin America are likely to remain the investment focus, but the smaller markets and particularly those undergoing restructuring will undoubtably command increasing attention, says Michael Spriggs, director of SBC Warburg in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These included the small, but well established markets of Southern Africa (Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe) and the embryonic markets of Central Africa (Ghana and Kenya).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spriggs said the single largest factor holding back investment in Africa was investor views on country risk. Quantifying this risk was problematical because it inevitably involved subjective judgments but a useful reference was the estimates published by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EIU ranked about 85 countries, with scores ranging from 100 (Bosnia and Iraq) to five (Singapore). Fewer than half of these had developed markets, and not all had significant mining industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spriggs said the 21 countries included from Africa fell into three broad groups:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l low-risk markets of Southern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana) and North Africa (Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l moderate risk markets (Ghana, Zimbabwe and Kenya);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l high-risk areas of North Africa (Libya, Algeria) and Central Africa (Zaire, Sudan).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These rankings inevitably vary with changing circumstances in individual countries, mainly political movements but, as the crisis in Mexico in 1994 showed, economic policies and debt management are also important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other important considerations for investors include: security of tenure, right to repatriate profits, management and equity control and a consistent tax regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's efforts have begun to show some tangible results. A recent review by the Financial Times of the spending plans of 154 mining companies showed that 12% of their combined exploration budgets were destined for Africa in 1995. Planned expenditure in Africa rose 61% to $320-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenge for Africa is to transform these exploration dollars into long-term investment and judging by the many serious one-to-one meetings held between African and Western mining companies and investors at this weeks conference, they might just do it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - This week's parliamentary ad hoc committee debate on changes to the National Gambling Bill brings legalised gambling closer, and accentuates certain problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The enabling legislation provides for the granting of 40 licences, a National Gambling Board (NGB), a national inspectorate and determination of national norms and standards. The NGB will take over from the Lotteries and Gambling Board.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are six major bidders in consortiums that all include black business groups. African Sun International, comprising Sun International, Thebe Investments, Khulani Holdings, Real Africa Holdings, Vela International, and the Women's Investment Portfolio, is the largest and only group with existing casino interests in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other groups are Tsogo Sun (Southern Sun and the Gaming Consortium each own 50%), Casinos Austria, Global Resorts, Karos and Stocks &amp; Stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All can be expected to get a slice of the 40- licence cake in a scenario that could see African Sun International end up with 10 licences and the rest end up with four to eight each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In projects ranging from R25-million to mega- resorts of R1,5-billion, Global Resorts estimates that a total R13-billion or so could be invested in casino resorts by the end of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It estimates that casino revenue of R3,1-billion in 1995 (half earned by Sun International and the other half earned by illegal operators) will reach R12-billion by 2000 or R6,8-billion in todays money (adjusted to net present value at 12%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many problems have to be resolved before these projections can be met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most important, especially for Sun International which has seven licences in both the eastern Cape and North west, is the number of licences a group can have in the same province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The draft bill restricts a single casino operator to two licences per province and forces them to comply within two years of the legislations promulgation. After heavy lobbying, General Affairs Minister Chris Fismer this week suggested this be raised to three licences, and the deadline to dispose of any excess licences be extended to May 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This deadline also demands that provincial governments with casino interests dispose of them. Provincial governments are not allowed to own a licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there is the growing discord between central and regional governments, essentially over who should get the spoils from gambling and how. Provinces have been allowed to proceed with their own gambling legislation before the national bill was passed. Now KwaZulu-Natal and western Cape are indicating that they are not bound by the number of licences granted them. Gauteng is paving the way for VAT on gambling to go into its coffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Potential conflicts of interest where officials are linked to consortia also have to be cleared. The most noted example is KwaZulu-Natal finance MEC Johnny Mhlungu who has links with African Sun International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While there is plenty of serious money to be made in operating casinos, it is not a bottomless pit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Herein lies another fight between government and casino operators.  Government wants to maximise revenue, black economic empowerment and regional development. Casino operators, which consider these to be effective taxes, aim to maximise profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The all-important issue to be clarified before proposed developments can be detailed and licence applications submitted is the licence fee and gambling levy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While all this is taking place the illegal casino operators are continuing unregulated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Thabo Mbeki and his team returned tired but triumphant from the World Economic Forum in Switzerland on Wednesday. The deputy president was well-received, with fund managers clamouring to get a slice of the most popular emerging markets cake.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While nothing concrete in the form of rands and cents came out of the five-day conference of business and political leaders, interest was substantial, says Moss Ngoasheng, Mbeki's economic adviser. South Africa is already a popular haven for foreign investment portfolios; the South African contingents task was to convince the waverers and by the governments accounts, at least, they rose to the occasion admirably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Potential foreign investors cited crime and the insecurity surrounding privatisation as their chief concerns. Reassuringly, however, those companies already operating in South Africa saw crime as separate from political instability in sharp contrast to 18 months ago. Criminal violence was thus considered a different issue requiring different solutions although there is no room for complacency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Privatisation was also no longer a burning issue: the international investment community was not insisting on the wholesale disposal of state assets but acknowledged that the equity partnership route favoured by government suited South Africas development needs. Nor was there evidence of impatience over exchange controls, said Ngoasheng: the commitment had been made and it was only a matter of time before the government felt the climate was right to go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seemed there was no stopping South Africa. Jurgen Schrempp, head of daimler-Benz in Germany, predicted that South Africa could join the ranks of the Asian tigers in a few years, as long as the commitment to stable economic policies was upheld. Ngoasheng admits even he was taken aback at such high praise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa is the fastest-growing tourist destination in the world but this is due more to its flavour of the month status initiated by the 1994 elections than its marketing activities overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a shoe-string budget of R48-million for 1996 down from R56-million the year before Satour is hard-pressed to compete with other long-haul destinations such as Australia, which boasts a budget of more than R270-million purely for marketing the country internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So how can Satour, on its paltry budget, attract the best marketing expertise for the job, most of which is in the private sector?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business thinks it has the answers and last week formed a unified body, the Tourism Business Council of South Africa (TBCSA), aimed at advancing the restructuring of South Africa s tourism industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of its first tasks will be to lobby government to increase Satours funding for marketing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newly elected chairman of the TBCSA David Wigley said the council will focus on the urgent need for infrastructural development to sustain tourism growth, recommendations to reduce crime, international strategies to market South Africa, as well as strategies for working with labour and the community in pursuing the overall tourism vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said tourism, acknowledged as the world s largest earner of foreign exchange, had enormous potential for growth in South Africa where it was only the fourth-largest component of gross national product, at 3%, against an average 10% in the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive director of Satour Mavuso Msimang welcomes the new business council, which he said would contribute to decisions on how Satour markets South Africa. Business councils exist in all the countries that are really serious about tourism and we plan to become fully involved in initiatives of the new council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tourism chief director Mike Fabricius of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism says the Business Council should have an input on how South Africa would be marketed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, private sector companies promote their own interests and there will always be a need to generically posiition South Africa as a global tourist attraction, through a national marketing organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fabricius says the issue of funding is always in the spotlight. It is my firm belief that tourism should receive an adequate budget once the process is finalised. The challenge at this moment is to accommodate visitors coming to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, in the medium and longer term, the interest in South Africa will decrease, and especially then the marketing function will be essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Msimang concurs, adding that the changes in South Africa have opened a small window of opportunity for increased tourism. But we need to market ourselves aggressively if we are sustain and increase the number of visitors to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says growth in overseas visitors has risen from 700 000 in 1994 to an estimated one million tourists in 1995. Satour has set a target of getting 3,2-million overseas visitors by the year 2000, which is achievable if certain changes are implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the first initiatives that Msimang wants to implement is flattening the management structure of Satour from its current pyramid structure of 14 levels down to six levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current public service type structure of Satour is totally unsuitable because it creates long lines of communication and bureaucracy.  You literally have to climb the ladder to get an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This suggestion of flattening management was first made by consultants Ernest and Young, which drew up a number of recommendations for Satour in March 1995. These have been accepted by the new board of Satour but no changes can be implemented until approved at government level and this is the glitch holding up change at the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, government told Satour it would need to consult further with the Public Services Commission before structural changes could be made or Satour could risk losing some its revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our flexibility to reshuffle posts is limited as long as Satour is being viewed through a civil servant type perspective, comments Msimang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But why is Satour looking to make changes before the White Paper on tourism due out at the end of April has been approved? Msimang feels whatever else the White Paper will contain, it will certainly confirm that a national organisation must market South Africa internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether that body is a reformed or renamed Satour is not the point, if we get changes on the go now they will be taking on an organisation in better shape to do that task than it is now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, everyone knows changes need to happen and the longer it takes, the worse the effect on morale, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So what can be done in the meantime? Msimang sees the beefing up of international operations as vital, despite the lack of finance. Were hoping to increase our 14 international offices by making use of the many international offices of Department of Foreign Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also on the cards are partnership ventures with the private sector. Were negotiating with certain businesses as to whether they could sponsor some of our activities in exchange for some promotion of their product overseas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Twenty months after it first convened in Cape Town, what do South Africans think of their new Parliament? Perhaps predictably, opinion is mixed and differs along racial lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Public Opinion Service of the Institute for a Democratic Alternative for South Africa (Idasa) surveyed a sample of 2674 South Africans between September and November last year. The results, released this week, and weighted to reflect the opinion of of an electorate of about 24,3-million voters, show that 53% approved of Parliament's performance (23% strongly), while 36% disapproved (nine percent strongly) and seven percent had no opinion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Broken down racially, however, the picture changes. While 63% of African people approved of Parliament's performance, only 24% of white people did (62% disapproved, 24% strongly). The figures for Indian and coloured people's approval were 47% and 40% respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A key factor influencing perceptions about Parliament was contact with members of Parliament. A startlingly high 31% said they had had some contact during the past year whether personal, at a rally or meeting, with their staff or through receiving mail. In the United States the figure is 40%; in Hungary it's 8%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who had contact tended also to feel MPs did well in staying in touch with people, that they could help them and that, as citizens, they had some influence over Parliament. The survey showed that African respondents ranked higher than other South Africans in terms of contact with MPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Levels of parliamentary approval rated only slightly lower than the 58% who think the Government of National Unity is performing well, but far below the 77% who approve of the way President Nelson Mandela is doing his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of this was much more positive than opinion on the performance of provincial government, where 46% disapproved overall and 42% approved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - THE media are under renewed attack in some African countries, if a recent spate of arrests and bannings, and an apparent assassination attempt are anything to go by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post of Zambia, long a thorn in the side of President Frederick Chiluba, this week came under the strongest censure from government yet, when an edition of the paper was banned, the newspaper offices were searched by plain-clothes police and three editors arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a Zanzibar newspaper has been banned from publishing after it carried a series of articles critical of the island government; a Nigerian newspaper publisher reportedly survived an assassination attempt; and the deputy editor of a Zimbabwe publication came under fire for publishing a story critical of President Robert Mugabe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">T he Post managing director Fred M'membe and editors Bright Mwape and Masautso Phiri were charged on Tuesday for possession of prohibited publications reference to their own newspaper, the Monday edition of which Chiluba banned by presidential decree and for a transgression of the Official Secrets Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before their arrest on Tuesday, M'membe and Mwape told the Media Institute of Southern Africa (Misa) that Chiluba had warned members of the public that anyone found with the Monday edition was committing a crime.  Police were attempting to confiscate all copies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Official Secrets Act charge appears to relate to the reason the paper was banned: M'membe said the Monday edition carried an article exposing authorities' secret plan to force through the country's disputed draft constitution next month. The newspapermen's lawyer said the state was claiming his clients had received classified information for the article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post has carried a string of exposes claiming Chiluba was not born in Zambia and that he had lied about his academic qualifications and parentage. Phiri and M'membe were charged last year with criminal libel after The Post published a story in which a woman claiming to be Chiluba's mistress said she had been tortured by police.<BR>In the other incidents:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The privately owned Zanzibar newspaper Majira was banned by the island's information ministry a fortnight ago. The ministry cited a number of articles questioning President Salmin Amour's political conduct after the elections in October last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Majira editor-in-chief Anthony Ngaiza told Misa he had published, among others, an editorial referring to Amour as a hooligan when members of the main opposition party, the Civic United Front, were harassed and detained without trial. Ngaiza said he believed the ban was an attempt to cover up on the rising tension between the opposition and the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi.  The paper was taking legal action to challenge the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alex Ibru, publisher of Nigerian independent newspaper the Guardian, was reportedly shot in his car in Lagos by unknown assailants last week. He survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trevor Ncube, deputy editor of Zimbabwe's Financial Gazette, was suspended by his newspaper for a month this week after he published a story, but was reinstated on Wednesday. The story was supplied by Reuters news agency, claiming that Mugabe had asked his pilots to jump the queue at Maseru airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reuters Southern Africa acting bureau chief Ian Mackenzie said later: We are satisfied with the sourcing of our story from Maseru.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The R-word hit the newspaper headlines with meaning for the first time this week, after ANC hard-liner MP Pravin Gordhan warned minority parties that if negotiations failed, a referendum would be a reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a time when parties are shaping up to negotiate the worst of the disputes in the final constitution, this statement has jolted smaller political parties out of any sort of complacency, and perhaps that was what it was intended to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic Party's Colin Eglin commented this week that a referendum on the constitution would be a disaster. If you take the merits of the recent interim constitution in Kempton Park, it was seen as a healing document. If this constitution was taken to a referendum to break a deadlock, it would divide society and open up old wounds. To contemplate that sort of action is extraordinary and counter-productive to nation-building.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, it is the interim constitution that makes a referendum a possibility. The Kempton Park negotiators built a referendum into the constitutional text as the ultimate deadlock-breaking mechanism. If parties cannot reach consensus on the final constitution and Parliament fails to pass the constitution with a two-thirds majority, then the interim constitution stipulates that the partially supported constitution should be put to the public for the final say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the public then votes in favour of the constitution by more than 60%, it becomes the constitution of the land. If not, Parliament dissolves and fresh elections are held for a new Constitutional Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the successes of the local government elections behind it, the African National Congress believes firmly that it would win a constitutional referendum with a fair margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clearly though, it is not a first choice for resolving political impasses, but the ANC is not shy to use the threat of a referendum to reinforce its position as the most powerful negotiator in the Constitutional Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A referendum is very tempting, said a senior ANC negotiator. I mean, if smaller parties dig in their heels on matters, we could do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of negotiators from opposition parties say the ANC has never flashed the referendum card in the course of behind-the-scenes bilaterals.  However, they insist that ANC MPs drop the referendum possibility in informal conversations, as an unsubtle reminder to the opposition of what could happen if the process went off the rails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The practicalities of a referendum are mind-blowing. It would cost billions of taxpayers' rands and would probably be run by a body like the Independent Electoral Commission. The pre-referendum lobbying would end up like a bitter election campaign, and the country would once more have to go to the polls to vote for democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, it would probably plunge IFP-led KwaZulu- Natal into chaos.  Given that the IFP is resisting the constitution-making process, it would feel justified, no doubt, in resisting the outcome of the referendum which would result in the loss of the province's autonomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A referendum might also backfire on the ANC in Parliament as it could serve to unite all the opposition parties against the ANC on number of key issues of principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Corne Mulder of the Freedom Front (FF) said: I think that the ANC is making a mistake in the way it is interpreting the mood of the country at the moment as positive, probably due to the recent sporting successes. South Africa still has a long way to go before it is stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In many ways it does not matter if the smaller parties like the DP and the FF squeal at the ANC for its arrogance. If anything, this reminder from the ANC about what it could do to get its way is directed at the IFP, which is still boycotting the process, and the National Party, which needs to be reigned in if they want to get the requisite two-thirds majority consensus to pass the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While some NP members believe that the ANC is threatening them, the NP, through the voice of Constitutional Minister Roelf Meyer, remains civil: We take it that the ANC is committed to a constitution adopted by full or general consensus, and that is our approach too. We presume that the ANC is sticking to that position as it was stated by Cyril Ramaphosa over recent months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - THE SABC's failure to inform viewers and advertisers of what was planned for the new-look SABC because its relaunch was intended as a spectacular and not informative event could cost it a chunk of advertising support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mixed reaction by the advertising industry to the SABC's relaunch and programme reshuffling saw some advertising agencies responding harshly and others pledging support for the corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Young &amp; Rubicam managing director for business development in Africa, Doug Maritz, said the launch would not entice more advertising for the SABC because, although it was spectacular, the extravagance was inappropriate and a waste of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think this (the launch) was a complete waste of money, with anything between R3-million and R20- million spent, Maritz said, adding that the SABC should have concentrated on a television launch for different viewers in a bid to educate audiences on the new programmes and to inform them on reasons for the changes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new-look SABC is confusing, and for advertising agencies it is difficult to plan against the new channels for specific target markets. I also understand that there is a lot of channel-hopping by viewers to find something appealing, Maritz said, adding that the agency's clients were largely instructing it to come off the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The money is going to radio and print, while M-Net is laughing all the way to the bank, Maritz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saatchi &amp; Saatchi managing director William Leach pledged support for the corporation, saying it was making a good attempt to reach more people. We are urging clients to support the medium and to use common sense, Leach said, adding that he thought the launch was impressive and informative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No, it was not a waste of money when you consider that the SABC was trying to reposition something that is twenty years old, Leach said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saatchis' media director Gordon Muller said there was support for what the corporation had done, adding that the SABC was not the villain of the piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In two years of operation, all the IBA (Independent Broadcasting Corporation) has done has been to hand out 90 community radio stations, while the SABC has created some movement in the market in an attempt to be more representative. Their movement should be welcomed and not frowned upon, Muller said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If one ploughs through what hasn't changed instead of panicking at what has, one will see that programmes may be on different channels, but they are still the same, being broadcast at more or less the same times, Muller said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Media consultant to Mashabela Burrows, Nan Jackson said she was going to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. I don't think there are going to be any radical changes on television but, so far, SABC3 (formerly NNTV) seems to be good news, Jackson said, adding that it was the channel to go for if you are targeting the upper income group of viewers. I think it will give M-Net a run for its money, while SABC1 and SABC2 will definitely be a let's wait and see' for advertisers, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The let-down, however, of SABC3 was its restricted transmission, with only about 56% of the population linked up, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I also think the SABC is missing the mark with its promotional, in-house advertising, because it is not inspiring people to watch, Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eurospace media strategist Alistair Duff said he disagreed with a wait-and-see attitude because agencies could not afford to waste time. I don't think we can afford to wait and see but should, instead, be making educated guesses that certain programmes will perform well and attract audiences, while others won't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that his strategy would be to tell clients the SABC situation would balance out because, like any other media, at a time of change there was a period of flux, as was currently happening, but the fluctuation would balance out, particularly in the black market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think SABC1 and 2 are going to prove to be very strong channels, while SABC3, in its current format, with programmes from the former TV1, is no longer as strong an entertainment channel as TV1 was. SABC3's position, I believe, is slightly weakened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lindsay Smithers-FCB media director Tony Banahan said the SABC spent a disproportionate amount of money upfront, instead of concentrating on post-launch education for audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency is recommending to clients that they place advertisements around good and popular programmes, and to do this at peak times. There is an incredible amount of channel surfing and that is when our advertisements go out, he said, adding that clients had to be more programme-specific, because viewers followed programmes, irrespective of the channel they were broadcast on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jupiter Drawing Room media director Belinda Vosloo said the SABC reshuffling was not as disastrous as people made it out to be. We simply have to adapt, and agencies cannot dismiss the broadcaster as a non- viable medium. Where it suits the client and their target audience, we will still recommend the medium, Vosloo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of the day, people watch programmes and not stations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Television critics at South Africa's largest daily newspapers have generally given the thumbs-up to the SABC's new programme line-up on its three television channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Beeld's critic Andries Cornelissen is critical of the continued use of dubbing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the SABC wants to reflect South African society, it musn't look to dubbed programmes. Afrikaans local dramas have always been of a high quality and most viewers would prefer a local programme to dubbed series such as Beverly Hills 90210.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Sowetan's Mojalefa Mashego echoes these reservations: It is ridiculous to have American series dubbed into African languages. Mashego believes the SABC should be looking to other African countries for programmes if it wants to fulfill its promise of becoming a more African-oriented institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most problematic for many black viewers is the current practise of broadcasting news in two African languages. Says one viewer: It is uncomfortable for me, who understands both languages; it must be a waste of time for those who only understand one of the languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many viewers have been pleasantly suprised by the new state of affairs.  Transformation in South Africa has attracted connotations of rigid political correctness and, says The Star's Janet Smith, a lot of people were expecting RDP programming. English programmes have received the most favourable reception, with the high standard of prime-time viewing putting many viewers in the unfamiliar position of being spoilt for choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cornelissen has received phone calls from Afrikaans viewers saying they can't find news or programmes they understand. But, adds another Afrikaans commentator, much of the resentment generated among Afrikaners by the relaunch is not so much the changes in programming, but the loss of power (the relaunch) represents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The SABC's grand relaunch: Was it worth the money? Did anyone learn anything? Will advertisers support the new-look state television station?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jeff Zerbst found the SABC's grand relaunch of its TV stations to be a spectacle loaded with symbolism for the new South Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT was in a spirit of awe and reverence that one watched the SABC launch on Sunday. This veritable phantasmagoria of light and sound was pregnant with meaning and symbolism, and left nobody untouched by its sheer magic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ideological tone was set by those piercing lasers which flashed their way into every nook and cranny of an Air Force hangar near Pretoria.  Here, in imagistic form, was a rapier-like representation of the truth commission. One almost expected to see Magnus Malan hanging from a forklift.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The quintessential theme of flying was introduced before the show even began: a shamanistic warrior on a rock told us that, from now, South Africa, the sky's the limit. This prophetic statement, uttered during the same week that astronomers in California discovered a distant galaxy, 14-billion light years away, appeared oddly conservative in scope. Why should our limit be the sky when billions of miles of space stretched beyond it? Was this the SABC's way of telling us it wouldn't be televising our joint space project with the Russians?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then the point became clear: we should aim high, but keep a ceiling on our expectations. We shouldn't expect too much. Fair enough, I say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The image of the Boeing as a contextualising motif was astonishingly apposite. It was a veritable symbol of the South African nation. After all, it had a left wing and a right wing, and couples were spotted leaving it at regular intervals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No, no, this was not a celebration of the possibility of migration. The big, white plane, sporting the orange, white and blue of the old regime, was a symbol of the South Africa we had boarded in the past and from which we have now disembarked. Couples were seen abandoning it for a world of light, colour, diversity and plurality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And what great people there were seen disembarking. South Africans thrilled to the sight of a glittering array of local celebrities coming down the gangplank into the new world of hope and glory: Paul Ditchfield, Prudence Solomon, Martin le Maitre, Nicky Rebelo, Titch Mataaz ... few nations have seen their equal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, of course, there was President Nelson Mandela, a national talisman of truly business-class proportions. Madiba used a brilliant image which had obvious relevance to the occasion: Today we are shedding another layer of baggage. This statement constituted a reference to the morally overweight parcels we, as a nation, stored in the hold of the great white bird which failed to take us to heaven. It was a moment as moving as any in our history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also spoke at one point about steering the great ship through troubled waters, an image oddly out of joint with the aircraft theme until one realised that here was a moving reference to the Helderberg, which otherwise was not mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, lest readers should imagine that the evening was clouded in sentiment, one should hastily add that it was not. As in all new orders, brutality has its place and purges are perfectly within reason. Several SABC presenters left behind on the runway of history were Eon de Vos, Jan van Niekerk, Clarence Keyter, Dr Piet van Rensburg, Professor Tertius Harmse, Professor Ryno Swanepoel, Norma Odendaal, Adrian Steed, Tim Hart and Estelle de Koning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Eon de Vos, himself a pilot, the whole evening must have seemed like a supernatural nightmare choreographed with his personal humiliation in mind.  But he got off better than Clarence Keyter, whose voice suddenly disappeared as a film clip of Mandela's release from jail was shown. Keyter's image is expected to disappear mysteriously from all old SABC staff photographs during the next few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What these sacked presenters must appreciate is that only one person will now read the news and that weather forecasts will be voice-overs. This smacks of responsible budgeting in a world of gravy trains. How can launches costing between R4,5-million and R9- million be funded unless a few people's careers are sacrificed for the common weal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief criticism of the evening was the presence of black American males as chief presenters and guests of honour. Some SABC staffers, indeed, have had the temerity to suggest that the evening represented a slap in the face of South African entertainment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These whingers missed several key points. Firstly, since Louis Farrakhan a recent visitor here is always telling black American men to shape up, get a life, stop using drugs and spend more time with the family, it was important to prove that African- Americans could stand up straight and deliver a dozen or so lines without running off stage to ingest a prohibited substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, having already placated Afrikaners with a white aeroplane, and the rest of South African whites by parading the cricket and rugby teams, it was entirely unnecessary to include more palefaces. The whole history of South African TV has, after all, been a sea of white faces sprouting lies, propaganda and hatred. It will take many decades before anyone here trusts a white face with moving lips again. A celebratory pageant was obviously the wrong occasion to try the concept out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thirdly, the appearances of Blair Underwood, Malcolm Jahmal Warner, Robert Guillame, Stevie Wonder and Johnny Cochrane reveal that we are now accepted in America, the spiritual home of commercial TV. The coded message here is that we, too, are now sufficiently moral and pure to watch soap operas, sitcoms and talk shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fourthly, we must not cultivate short memories in this brave new democracy. Examine, for example, the following reader's question published in The Citizen: What the hell has OJ Simpson's lawyer got to do with my viewing?  With respect, sir, Johnny Cochrane was one of the finest TV performers of 1995. Did you not watch the OJ Simpson show packaged in the States as a courtroom drama and realise that here was the reason for LA Law's sudden loss of ratings and subsequent demise? Did you, somehow, miss the best viewing of the century?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lastly, and most importantly, we have the rest of our lifetime to watch so-called local talent. Why spoil a good party by forcing us to watch it at an eagerly awaited launch?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some perennial conscientious objectors have claimed the SABC launch was merely surface gloss and told us little about what has actually changed at the SABC. They could not have watched the inserts about Channels 1, 2 and 3 very carefully. These were crisp and informative and, even if they weren't, they were over pretty quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any case, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The launch extravaganza cannot tell us how good our TV is. Only watching it can do that.  My wife tells me you can now see The Bold and the Beautiful in the morning and in the afternoon! She's very happy with the new SABC and we should all be too.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - Text of the address by President Mandela to Parliament on February 9, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Honourable President and Deputy President of the Senate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Honourable Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy Presidents, Ministers and Deputy Ministers;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President of the Constitutional Court;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leaders of our Security Services;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Directors-General and leaders of the public service; Honourable Members of Parliament; Distinguished guests; Ladies and gentlemen: Today, in the streets of Johannesburg, the New Patriotism of our new democracy once again asserts itself as citizens of that city express their appreciation for the feat of our soccer team in the African Nations Cup. This is bound to replay itself in other cities, adding to the crowning glory of our rugby world champions.  Ours sports-persons are performing beyond the nation's wildest expectations. On and off the field, they are uniting our nation like never before, by their determination to do the best for their country.  Such is the true character of South Africans. We do possess the inner strength to achieve excellence. We have the will to persevere against all odds.  We enter 1996, as Cabinet and the rest of the Executive, as parliamentarians, as workers and managers, as professionals, traditional leaders, security forces, students and communities in general, faced with the challenge of bringing these positive qualities to bear on everything we do: to make South Africa a winning nation.  We must bring out the best in all of us; and, like our sports-persons, perform better everywhere: * to expand the economy and create jobs; * to improve the quality of life for all; * to expand the frontiers of freedom; and * to ensure comprehensive security for all citizens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the critical challenges that we face within and outside these hallowed chambers.  In October this year, we shall pass the half-way mark of the present legislature and its executive. The nation and the world will judge us not on whether we mean to do good; but, above all, on whether we have mobilised South Africans to work together to improve their quality of life.  Indeed, Madame Speaker, we can say with confidence that, steadily but surely, the great majority of South Africans do feel that things are improving for the better. We are on our way - South Africa is on its way - to a better future.  Life has started to have real meaning for the hundreds of thousands who now have access to clean and safe drinking water.  The benefits of democracy have a tangible impact for the 400 000 homes which have been supplied with electricity during the course of last year. To the millions of children who benefit from the school nutrition scheme, free medical care and free and compulsory education, not only has the present become better; there is also greater confidence in the future.  This is the case with communities where the clinic-building programme and the district health system are taking root; the workers in Public Works Programmes; the communities who can, at last, feel secure on a piece of land they can call their own; and the families who, for the first time, are benefiting from the farmer support programme and extension of agricultural credit.  At last, millions who had no hope in the future can look ahead with confidence, in the full knowledge that they have a government prepared to work together with then to build a better life for all.  We formally start the third session of the democratic parliament with South Africa's economy healthier that in many decades. The rekindling of business confidence and optimism reflect the solid foundation on which the economic upswing is based. The expansion of the manufacturing sector, phenomenal growth in fixed investments and large capital inflows hold out a promise for a durable recovery and the potential for an even better performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We enter 1996 with no hesitation about the extent to which democracy has taken root in our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The confidence of the population in the democratic process was again shown during the Local Government elections.  At the same time, the institutions charged with safeguarding constitutional freedoms, such as the Human Rights Commission, the Land Commission, and the Office of the Public Protector have been formed. The Constitutional Court has, in its one year of existence, firmly asserted itself as an independent, impartial and authoritative guardian of the Constitution. In brief, South African politics is ascending to the level of normality, where civilised standards of political relations will be entrenched, unmediated by antagonistic conflict or administrative interventions.  The progress we have made, across the board, is a result, in great measure, of the intervention of Honourable Members gathered here and the provincial legislators, in setting the parameters and directions of transformation; in your devoted attention to draft legislation and in your confident interaction with the citizenry.  It is to be expected that critical attention will e paid to the performance of these elected institutions. Our legislatures are, in the first instance, the custodians of the new system, and, secondly, the bodies through which the programme of reconstruction and development, nation-building and reconciliation, can and should be codified and turned into a living reality.  Yes, South Africa is not only on the right road, We are well on our way to make this the country of our dreams. I take this opportunity to congratulate all South Africans, in the public and private sectors - the most prominent in the land as well as the humble member of the community - all of whom are striving to add another brick to the edifice of our democracy. We have set out on this road together, and we should together aim for the stars.  Madame Speaker; If these achievements are something to be proud of, this is because they have laid the foundation to make a real impact on the inequities of the past. For we are only at the beginning of a long journey, a journey we should undertake with expedition, if our consciences are not impervious to the cries of desperation of millions. But this is a journey, too, that requires thorough planning and tenacious industry, if we are to remain on course and capable of sustaining our march.  Let me preface the identification of the challenges of the coming year by saying that all of us, all South Africans, are called upon to become builders and healers. But, for all the joy and excitement of creation, to build and to heal are difficult undertakings.  We can neither heal nor build, if such healing and building are perceived as one-way processes, with the victims of past injustices forgiving and the beneficiaries merely content in gratitude. Together we must set out to correct the defects of the past.  We can neither heal nor build, if on the one hand, the rich in our society see the poor as hordes of irritants; or if, on the other hand, the poor sit back, expecting charity.  All of us must take responsibility for the upliftment of our conditions, prepared to give our best to the benefit of all.  We can neither heal nor build, if we continue to have people in positions of influence and power who, at best, pay lip service to affirmative action, black empowerment and the emancipation of women, or who are, in reality, opposed to these goals; if we have people who continue with blind arrogance to practice racism in the work-places and schools, despite the appeal we made in our very first address to this parliament. We must work together to ensure the equitable distribution of wealth, opportunity and power in our society.  We cannot build or heal our nation, if - in both the private and public sectors, in the schools and universities, in the hospitals and on the land, in dealing with crime and social dislocation - if we continue with business as usual, wallowing in notions of the past. Everywhere and in everything we do, what is now required is boldness in thinking, firmness in resolve and consistency in action.  The message I am trying to convey is that all of us make the national project of accelerated and fundamental transformation of our country very seriously indeed. The achievement of the objectives of equity, non-radicalism and non-sexism constitute the very essence of the new society we seek to build.  In the history of nations, generations have made their mark through their acumen to appreciate critical turning points, and with determination and creativity, to seize the moment. South Africa is well on its way to a new and better life. This we will achieve only if we shed the temptation to proceed casually along the road; only if we fully take the opportunities that beckon.  We must unite in a New Patriotism to achieve the goal of creating a new society.  Madame Speaker; The potential for economic growth and development are better than in may decades. But let us be brutally frank.  Despite the welcome rate of growth, very few jobs have been created. In fact, against the backdrop of new entrants into the job market, there has been a shrinkage in opportunities. We need a national vision to lift us out of this quagmire.  If we do not act together in the public and private sectors to develop and implement such a national strategic vision, the danger is that even the modest growth we have attained, will peter out in a matter of a few years, as the strain of limited capacity, skills shortage, balance of payments and other constraints start to gather momentum; and as increasing unemployment and accelerating poverty bear down on our society.  To move forward with purpose requires that we extricate the public and private sectors from the current comfort zones, and break through the threshold to achieve a rate of growth sufficient to create jobs, and generate resources for rapid socio-economic programmes to uplift the poor.  For purposes of emphasis, let me identify three important investment challenges and attendant difficult choices that have to be made.  Firstly, we require major investment in infrastructure, including such areas as municipal services, housing and construction and telecommunications in order to create jobs at the same time as we improve services to the citizenry. As we enter these areas in a decisive manner, the question will arise, over and over again, whether we can attain our objective, if the profit motive is the only dynamo of our actions!  Secondly, we need investment and restructuring of manufacturing and other industries such as tourism, agriculture and mining, which are critical for export and foreign exchange earnings. Related to this, for instance, is the challenge whether we can continue with the same structure of our agricultural industry given our capricious climatic conditions!  Thirdly, none of the economic objectives we aspire to can be realised without massive investment in people. I refer here to the questions of skills development, adult education, and the overhaul of our entire education system, as well as health and other services, which I will return to later. Indeed, as we struggle to widen the skills base and to absorb more people into the economy, the challenge will continue to face organised labour and the employed in general, including the managers: can we succeed if we premise our actions narrowly on the interests of those who are already economically engaged!  When all is said and done, we return again tot he challenge of a New South African Patriotism; that at the end of each day everyone of us should afford a smile in his or her face, when we pose to ourselves the question: what have I done today to create jobs and improve my skills and those of others!  As Government, we fully acknowledge the critical role that we need to play in realising the vision of growth and development.  I wish to emphasise that, over the past year, Government has moved to a new level of co-ordination that is unprecedented in the history of our country. It is quite clear to us, that success in achieving the growth and development objectives we have identified requires integration of planning and operations across departments and provinces. Important cross-sectoral meetings and inter-governmental forums are being held to elaborate the growth and development strategy and the institutional mechanisms required to drive it.I should personally make the observation that we are finally succeeding in galvanising Government to give effective leadership to economic growth and development. Within weeks, we should be able to make major announcements on the progress made.  In order to improve the investment climate, our monetary authorities are reviewing, on an on-going basis, the timing and pace of lifting existing exchange controls.  For us, it is not a matter of whether, but of when, these controls will be phased out.  It is critical, if we have to promote competitiveness, export and the creation of jobs, that we should have in place the necessary supply-side measures. Already, consensus is being reached in NEDLAC about the required incentives that will help boost training, productivity, work organisation and investment in particular industries and regions. Arguably, the most important measure in this regard pertain to the development of small and medium-sized businesses.  Relevant legislation on these issues, as well as the critical question of competitive practices in the economy, should come before parliament during the course of this session.  I am convinced that the various role-players in the economy have long passed questioning the need or otherwise for such competitive practices, and the long-term benefits this will bring to the economy, including big and small companies. I hope, too, that legislation on employment equity and standards will be passed in this session, with the support of all relevant stake-holders.  This should also be the case with the restructuring of public assets, in order to use them to accelerate growth and development, attune them with modern levels of technology, reorganise them to expand services to all citizens, and reshape them in line with the imperatives of internal democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was to be expected, that such a massive undertaking should generate much debate among the public and the working class, in particular. What is clear, though, is that there was a breakdown of communication, which precipitated unnecessary acrimony on an issue that should enjoy the support of all interested parties. I am happy that the National Framework Agreement, negotiated between Government and the Trade Unions, was adopted by Cabinet two days ago.  Therefore, the government's relationship with labour, from the level of the executive as a whole, to the departments and the management of public enterprises, must be set on a viable footing to ensure co-operative rather than confrontational interaction. We are confident that the restructuring programme will be carried out with due speed- and carried out in a manner that involves and benefits all stake-holders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madame Speaker and Honourable Members; It is the firm view of the Government of National Unity that the growth and development strategy should be pursued in an integrated manner. We do not subscribe to the notion that growth on its own can rectify the backlogs of apartheid in a mysterious trickle-down fashion. In any case, in our skewed social structure, there cannot be growth without development.  Government has to continue paying attention especially to those areas of development that protect and improve our human resources.  Four important areas identify themselves for special mention.  The first area is education. On this the 20th anniversary of the Students' Uprising and the OAU-declared Year of Education in Africa, we face the stark reality that South Africa lags behind many African countries in so far as literacy and other human development indicators are concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We owe it to that corps of brave young people who rose up against the apartheid system to institute further measures this year, decisively to move towards a non-racial, democratic and equitable education system. If anything, the Matric results last year, and the reality of children, in the Northern Province and elsewhere, whose classes have to scatter in disarray at the first signs of rain, are a stark reminder of how far we still are from the goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clearly, rectifying these imbalances will require redistribution of the limited resources among races and Provinces. It will also require even greater commitment to teach and to learn from teachers and students alike.  And I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate them as well as the parents for the stability that has set in, in our institutions of learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two days ago, Cabinet adopted the White Paper on education. The centre-piece of such restructuring should be the establishment of a quality-driven public school system available to all South African children.  Among other things that should drive this, is democratic governance involving parents, teachers and students at secondary level, a curriculum and career-guidance scheme that are more appropriate to the needs of the country, and community involvement. Adult Basic Education and Early Childhood Development will also receive particular attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At university and technikon levels, it is necessary that the debate on transformation starts in earnest in an organised manner, so that policy positions can emerge to guide these autonomous institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As one measure of our commitment to tackle the backlogs in the building of schools, R1-billion has been allocated for this purpose. A further R300-million has been set aside for a student financing support scheme for universities and technikons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The matter of retrenchment of teachers has once again arisen, though in a sensational and unfortunate manner. Today, I once more wish to reassure teachers that this government is committed to re-deploy rather than retrench teachers. Any other approach would not make sense, given the needs in many parts of the country. This process itself will be the subject of extensive consultation, and only in extreme cases, will the possibility of retrenchment be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I hope that this year will see co-operation among all parties in these chambers to facilitate educational reform. Pronouncements about economic growth sound hollow, if they are followed up by attempts to block, by hook or by crook, legislation meant to equip children with the required skills.  Declarations of loyalty to democracy can only be but mere words, if in actual practice, people are seen to defend islands of white privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second important area is health delivery. many steps have been taken to introduce a new health policy based, principally, on greatly expanding the primary health care system. The clinic-building programme often seems insignificant by the standards of those who have resources in abundance. But, in the rural areas and sprawling urban settlements, this is a matter, literally, of life and death. It is therefore of great significance that we have moved from the planning stages to actual implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the course of last year, many ugly incidents took place which brought to the fore the terrible conditions under which health workers operate. Let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to them, for their selfless service to communities. While we strongly disapprove of some of these incidents, we fully appreciate their plight. Discussions are at an advanced stage to formulate a new grading system and avail incentives, especially in rural areas. Like with all other pro with all other professions, we value very highly the services of doctors and other health workers; and we shall do our best to ensure their security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I should once more emphasise the need for a massive education campaign on the AIDS epidemic, and commend the relevant ministries for the work they are doing in this regard. We dare remind ourselves, that all the objectives we outline here, will not be possible to attain, if the AIDS epidemic is not brought under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third area to which we must pay special attention is housing policy and implementation. It is a matter of common knowledge - painfully common to those without housing - that many constraints have bedevilled the proper implementation of this programme. But the staying power of this democratic government is its preparedness to acknowledge weaknesses and strive to rectify them. Such is the quality of the minister and staff, that they have critically and openly examined these problems, and identified corrective measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is clear from their decisions, is that we need, not one, but many integrated campaigns to deal with the housing problem. These include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * greater commitment on the part of financial institutions to allocate resources to poor areas; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * firm indications from communities that the rent and service boycotts have, in the spirit of Masakhane, come to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over and above these issues, we cannot overemphasise the centrality particularly of Local Government in the housing programme, the provision of infrastructure and related campaigns. We also need to examine the pertinent question of the integration of our cities. Too many of the low-cost housing initiatives are mere additions to apartheid's black townships, saddled with the same problems of distance from work-places and lack of proper community facilities. To address this will require a creative approach, among others, to the question of residential densities, which will also help to reduce infrastructural costs, including those related to public transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fourth area pertains to land reform. I am certain that all of us welcome the passing of the Bill on security of tenure and the launch last week of the Green Paper on land reform. When finalised, the policies adopted will form an important part of our rural development strategy. For the first time in centuries, families turned into insecure sojourners in the land of their birth, can talk of real security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soon, the Land Claims Court will begin its work; and we are confident that it will deal with the complex problems in a manner that ensures justice and promotes the agricultural interests of the country. No one has reason to fear; the aim of government is to build, not to destroy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In these four areas of our socio-economic programmes and others, what is required is a partnership among all sectors: communities, government and the private sector. Thus, when we talk of the New Patriotism, we are talking also of efforts of communities to build one another and together build their future. We are talking of Masakhane!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madame Speaker;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question needs to be posed, whether we do indeed have a state machinery capable of meeting the objectives of growth and development!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I should start off by thanking all Ministers, the Public Service Commission and heads of department sincerely for their efforts in this difficult transitional period. Steadily, progress is being registered in making the Public Service broadly representative of society. From a trifle of 6%, today black managers constitute 37% of this echelon. From less than 5%, females now constitute 10% of management. Progress, yes - but not nearly enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Public Service Commission has placed on the table a new salary and grading system, which contains within it the potential to redress past inequalities, stabilise labour relations and promote reform of the Service.  Government supports this proposal in principle, and discussions are continuing on ways of financing it. We are confident that, when finalised, the White Paper and legislation will enjoy the support of workers and managers alike, all of whom will have fully participated in their formulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, all this does not resolve some of the complex and immediate problems arising from the apartheid past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let us remind ourselves of this government's mandate which is to establish a single, streamlined, efficient and transparent Public Service and to allocate more public resources to capital expenditure. Let us be frank and say that the current service is too large, and it has to be rationalised.  There is no other option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, our actions cannot ignore the painful truth that the most affected will be areas that are poor, with low economic activity and little prospect for alternative employment. This means, among other things, searching for creative negotiated solutions that will help stimulate economic activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rationalisation process will not be vindictive. Neither will it be carried out in a haphazard manner. Rather, it will affect all races and provinces. Discussion are well advanced with the relevant ministry to set up the Presidential Review Commission which will redefine the structure, functions and procedures of the Public Service, and relevant announcements can be expected soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the greatest challenges for 1996 is to further build the capacity of government to serve communities. Nowhere is this needed more than at local level, where government interacts on a daily basis with communities. It should therefore be the case that one of the main themes of this year will be the introduction of massive training programmes for the newly-elected councillors and their staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local Goverment must be given the necessary capacity not only to handle finances and render efficient and affordable services. It is critical that accountability and mobilisation of communities should also form part of their ethos. This, elected officials at local level should know, that, in the final analysis, nation-building and reconciliation, economic growth and development, will depend largely on the performance of local councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite predictions to the contrary, the people showed their confidence in the new democracy, and re-affirmed their mandate to the Government of National Unity in the November elections. Our task, at all levels, is to justify that trust and confidence by mobilising them to work together for an improvement in their conditions of live. It is part of that mandate to ensure that there is co-operative governance among all tiers; so that national provincial and local governments complement one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In kwaZulu-Natal and parts of the Western Cape, where local elections will take place in May, we expect, and should work for, campaigns that are free of violence and intimidation; campaigns which promote unity in our diversity. We hope that all the parties, within and outside this chamber, will openly commit themselves to conduct of free and fair elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Honourable Members;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national effort to improve the quality of life of the people means also that each citizen and each community should enjoy security in the home, at work and in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We believe that it has nou dawned on all present here, that dealing with crime and violence requires a comprehensive strategy and hard work, rather than just injunctions from election platforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am happy to announce that Cabinet will soon unveil the National Crime Prevention Strategy for public comment. This strategy brings together the combined efforts of the police, judiciary and prison authorities in an effective criminal justice system. The aim is not only to improve the capacity of police to prevent crime and apprehend criminals; but it is also to ensure that they are dealt with to the full extent of the law, and properly rehabilitated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We commend the business community for the campaign they have launched against crime and corruption. Some of the practical steps that they have taken are starting tot bear fruit; and the many proposals from their Conference will form part of the Strategy we have referred to. Within communities, co-operation with the police is improving by the day, with positive results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one can doubt the commitment of the South African Police Service to deal with crime. And we pay tribute to them for daily putting their lives in danger in the service of their country. Great progress has been made in transforming this institution, integraitng the various services, introducing civilian oversight and ensuring professionalism in their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dedication with which the leadership of the Service has gone about rooting out corruption, and taking the war to the syndicates and other criminals, should be commended. And the abiding lesson from their success is that this can only be accomplished with the co-operation of communities and individual citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We should also remind ourselves, over and over agian, that crime constitutes more than just drug trafficking and car hijacking. When tons and tons of vegetables disappear without trace in a city council depot, this is criminal conduct of the worst order. When billions are siphoned off from companies and out of the country, this is criminal robbery of the nation's resources. When food and funds meant for school children are stolen, this is criminal plunder against our children and our future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A particular feature of crime in our country is the violence afflicting KwaZulu-Natal, the taxi industry as well as bizarre incidents of gang warfare and other murders. By any name and under any guise, this is criminal conduct; and it should be dealt with as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wish in particular to draw Honourable Members' attention to the incidents in the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast, wher individuals have organised themselves to undermine, physically and otherwise, investigations into the murders which took place over the holiday period. Armed with an assortment of weapons, the have taken it upon themselves, in full view of the public media, to challenge the nation's law-enforcement agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am today issuing a strong warning to these elements, that this cannot be allowed to continue. The time has come for our nation to choose whether we want to become a law-governed and peaceful society or hapless hostages of lawlessness. I have discussed this matter with the Ministry and the leadership of the Police Service, and they have assured me that strong action will be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to this, I wish to announce today, that preparations are under way to introduce measures that will prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public manifestations. No one, irrespective of organisations to which they may belong, will be exempted from these measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dealing with crime, violence and corruption requires a new morality for our new nation. Indeed, it requires a New Patriotism among communities, the public and private sectors, and the security services - so that at the end of each day, each one of us can answer in the affirmative the question: have I done something today, to stamp out crime!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The performance of the nation against crime depends heavily on the intelligence capacity of the security services as a whole. On this, depends also the security of our democracy. And I should pay tribute to the unsung heroes in the intelligence community who are contributing immensely to our successes in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I also wish to reiterate the government's commitment to protect the rights of privacy and ensure the security of all individuals in public service as well as other citizens. This is the code of conduct which guides all our security services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, in plying their dubious trade, criminals should not hope to hide behind these provisions of our constitution. The government will use all lawful means to ensure that they do not succeed in undermining our social fabric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Law-abiding citizens can rest assured that there are effective mechanisms in place to prevent and punish any rapacious invasion of their lives. Our security services are committed to follow the rules, because they know, as much as we all do, that anything else is a sure recipe for the decay of our democratic system, for a psychosis of fear and a slide into authoritarianism. The government, including the security services, will not allow this to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tribute also goes to the South African National Defence Force which has distinguished itself in the integration process, in further enhancing its legitimacy in the eyes of our people and the international community, and in assisting the police services to deal with crime and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As should be expected, the new political milieu has dictated that we scale down the resources allocated to the Defence Force. This is a difficult and painful process, particularly for the citizens in uniform. But we wish to assure them, that the aim has never been, and will never be, to undermine this important national resource.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is national consensus that our Defence Force requires an appropriate capacity and modern equipment. We welcome the fact that debate on these issues is now finding rational reflection in the discussions around the Defence White Paper and the National Defence Review. These processes should be completed during the course of this year, so that we can achieve certainty and a national policy to which all of us can pay allegiance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madame Speaker;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If during the course of the past year, South Africa afforded its citizens unprecedented freedom and a human rights culture, the frontiers are bound to widen immeasurably in 1996. The New Patriotism abroad in our nation, is a reflection of how liberating democracy is, for all our citizens in their rainbow colours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No longer is the state a mighty colossus intimidating everyone in its wake. The openness in this and other legislatures, the transparency of the executive and the participatory style of government - all these have given practical meaning to the concept of government by the people, for the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the independent institutions such as the Constitutional Court, which I mentioned earlier, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will help cement democracy by laying bare that which our nation should never again experience. It will entrench justice by affording victims the reparations due to them. It will, through this, and by means of amnesty, ensure lasting reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As with other such institutions, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will succeed only if it gets the co-operation of all of us. I call on all South Africans to respect the Commission's independence and impartiality, its integrity and good faith. The Commissioners themselves have reiterated what the founding legislation pronounces, that the aim of their work is justice and reconciliation, not vengeance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The frontiers of our freedoms are bound to widen this year, principally because the permanent basic law of the land will be adopted by the Constitutional Assembly. A few months remain before the deadline set in the interim constitution expires. We should burn the midnight oil to meet this deadline; and achieve normal democratic principles accepted everywhere in the world. It is also crucial that we attain constitutional certainty, both for ourselves and in our relations with the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many difficult issues need to be resolved. Questions of democratic majority rule, co-operative governance, universally-accepted human rights and language equity are only some of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As in the past, these matters can only be resolved in genuine negotiations, in the spirit of give and take. The new constitution must be inclusive: a basic law of the land to which all sectors of society can pay allegiance. It behoves all members and parties in the Constitutional Assembly, to take full part in the work of the Assembly, and fulfil the mandate of their supporters. And, in all instances, we should be guided by the imperative to make our country a truly non-racial and non-sexist democracy, its citizens united by equity in their diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are the principles which should also guide us in protecting and advancing members of our society who have suffered undue privations under apartheid, women and youth, in particular. Honourable members will agree with me, that we cannot allow parliament to rise at the end of this session, before legislation on the Youth and Gender Equality Commissions is adopted.  In addition to ensuring focused and systematic attention to the needs of these sectors, these Commissions will help mobilise the resources required to implement relevant programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We should also continue paying the required attention to children, senior citizens and the disabled. Besides the other programmes indicated earlier, progress is being made in the Cabinet Committee which is developing a National Programme of Action on Children. And the restructuring of the welfare system in general, and as it pertains to the elderly, are among the tasks that the relevant departments are expected to accomplish this year. We wish to reaffirm this government's commitment to introduce programmes that will ensure that the disabled can realise their full potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we deepen our democracy and make progress in our transformation, it is to be expected that South Africa will be called upon to relate to the international community more as an equal partner rather than a mere beneficiary of solidarity. This we should be proud of, because it reflects the confidence the world has, in the progress we are making towards creating a normal society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to hosting important events of the Southern African region, world conferences on critical socio-economic questions, science and technology as well as sporting tournaments, we have started to play an important role in contributing to peace and other efforts of the international community. This we shall always do, within the limits of our capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our participation at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the United Nations, helped reinforce the voice for the UN to restructure itself in line with the demands of the current age. We are proud that South Africa will this year host the 9th Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Conference on the Information Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We should not tire of contributing our fair share to the building of a better world, if only because such and outcome is in the best interests of South Africa as well. However, we should always be mindful of the limitations we have as a nation, as well as the constraints of the real world we have to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are confident that during the course of this year, progress will be made in the negotiations with members of the Southern African Customs Union, the European Community and other regions, for agreements that will benefit ourselves and our partners. Let us also take this opportunity to reiterate our firm commitment to regional co-operation under the auspices of SADC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In our relations with virtually all countries of the world, be it in the Organisation of African Unity and its member states, the Bi-national Commissions with the United States and Russia, relations with countries of the Indian Ocean Rim, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and the Americas, we have not only come across goodwill, but also immense opportunities for our country.  As to whether we take full advantage of these opportunities, depends on all of us, both in the public and private sectors. We hope that the Discussion Documents being finalised by the Foreign Ministry will generate informed public debate about our international relations, the better to unite all sectors of our population in advancing the nation's interests.  Madame Speaker;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a New Patriotism abroad in our land. Whatever the social stations they occupy, no matter how humble - South Africans are showing a determination to work together and make our country a winning nation. Our task is to harness these energies into a material force for growth and development, safety and security, nation-building and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such are the demands of this historical moment. Such are the demands of the new South Africa.  I am confident that this Session of parliament will measure up to the challenge of the times.  I thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has appointed a former Delmas treason trialist and a leader of the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk as additional members of one of its committees.  Mr Tom Manthata, formerly a fieldworker for the South African Council of Churches, and Professor Piet Meiring, moderator of the NG Kerk's Eastern Transvaal Synod, have been appointed to the Committee on Reparation and Rehabilitation.  This was announced by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairperson of the commission, after a meeting of its executive committee in Cape Town today.  He said the commission hoped to finalise the names of additional members of the Committee on Human Rights Violations on Monday. He also announced that the commission had not yet decided on the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer.  The full text of his statement follows: &quot;I have great pleasure in announcing that Mr Tom Manthata and Professor Piet Meiring have been appointed as additional members of the Committee on Reparation and Rehabilitation of The Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  &quot;Mr Manthata is a former fieldworker for the Dependants' Conference and for the division of Justice and Reconciliation of the South African Council of Churches. He has had long experience of providing relief to victims of injustice. He was convicted in the so-called Delmas treason trial during the 1980s, and spent years in detention before being released after a successful appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court.  &quot;Professor Meiring was elected moderator of the Synod of Eastern Transvaal of the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk in 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is head of the Department of Science of Religion and Science of Mission at the Theological Faculty of the NG Kerk at the University of Pretoria. He has occupied a wide range of senior positions in the structures of the NG Kerk and has published widely. In 1982 he was one of 134 NG Kerk ministers who called the church to task for its justification of apartheid.  &quot;The Commission has the power to appoint two additional members to the Committee on Reparation and Rehabilitation, and 10 to the Committee on Human Rights Violations. We hope to announce the 10 extra members of the latter after a meeting of the Committee next Monday.  &quot;The Executive Committee today decided not to make an immediate appointment of a Chief Executive Officer, but to extend its search before making a final decision. We intend making an appointment as quickly as possible.&quot; For further information, contact John Allen, Media Liaison (27-82) 452-7859</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A feeling of dejection and the cry with abandon over the total destruction of the road network in the city of the seat of government has reached such a crescendo that the citizenry either saunter or drive in and out of it with unparalleled intense trepidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The destruction of the road network has happened paradoxically amidst plenty in terms of abundance of cheap human labour at the City Council, labour office, financial resources from the fuel levy, the donor funds and the sheer availability in superfluity of raw materials such as aggregates of all sizes, cement, lime sand and tar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lately, there was an announcement that the city council was going to spend one billion kwacha to patch up some selected roads in Lusaka. On the face value that came as good news to strangers not familiar with the quality of services the council offers and to the gullible with less than a critical eye to detect the chicanery with which roads are either patched or resurfaced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, a road contractor put up a banner &quot;Men at Work&quot; twenty metres behind a group of human beings in perpendicular and stooping positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out of curiosity to see what was happening, a stop-over was made and after interviews and analysis, it was discovered that in actual fact, it was not 'Men at Work' but 'Kids at Work' professionally, honestly and the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This country suffers from a serious problem of deficient technical, administrative and managerial personnel. It is difficult to understand how some people can continue pouring billions of hard to come by kwacha into systems without starting with the drawing room to design how work is going to be done and set standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One need not be an engineer to know that water and soil do not mix to form a monolithic block, hence, it is imperative that before any road repair is carried out, the drainage system is attended to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A road is supposed to be cambered so that the middle forms a slight upward curve to drain off the surface water down to the side ditches. The road must have a shoulder which is lower than the middle of the road to both drain off surface water into the side ditches and act as a sidewalk and parking lane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sides must not be higher than the middle as it is the case with the roads in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This turns them into catchwater ditches and rivers even with just a downpour of two minutes..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reason why the road should be cambered and potholes properly sealed is simple. When the drainage system is poor and potholes open up, rain water or water from any source is allowed to perforate through and affects the binding force of the subsoil which had been turned into a monotholic block by compaction during construction. This stone-like block must remain so in order to take or carry the designed weight of whatever vessel or static load that may be exerted on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should the water seep in and the cohesion and binding force of the subsoil get disturbed, cracks and breakages of the tarmac start to occur at the slightest passage of any load heavier than the bearing capacity of the section of the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This accounts for the wanton destruction of our road network - the lack of standards in construction and repair of roads. Hence, all the money that the country is generating from fuel levy and other taxes will be wasted for as long as 'Kids at Work' are responsible for road rebuilding and rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But High Court judge David Lewanika adjourned the case of three Post editors to February 13 for ruling whether or not the bail granted to the accused should be revoked as demanded by the DPP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trio, managing director and editor-in-chief Fred M'membe, managing editor Bright Mwape, and special projects editor Masautso Phiri were granted bail after spending two days in police custody on charges of receiving a document or article or information and unlawful possession of prohibited publication (12 copies of Post edition 401 of Monday, February 5 against the wishes of the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Government yesterday admitted it was planning a referendum in March, next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Information minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa claimed the referendum proposal was still a confidential matter of which the public were to be informed later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was a confidential matter on which cabinet was going to deliberate and decide on,&quot;Mwanamwambwa said in a press statement yesterday. &quot;The public was going to be informed of the decision(s) in due course in accordance with government's established procedures.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Mwanamwambwa also called on Zambians to continue speaking, writing and publishing freely any information they may have without fear of being monitored.  He made this appeal in response to local and international reactions to the arrest and detention of three editors of The Post newspapers and the presidential decree banning their Monday's edition 401 which had carried the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanamwambwa said the arrest of post editors was normal because they have allegedly committed a criminal offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Post staff who are facing charges have been arrested for a criminal offence of being illegally in possession of a classified and confidential government document,&quot; Mwanamwambwa said, justifying: &quot;This is a normal and routine law enforcement; democracy is among other things principally about the rule of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He claimed press freedom in Zambia is intact as are the rights and liberties of all citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The MMD government is committed to democratic governance and strict observance of the citizens' human rights,&quot; Mwanamwambwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Zambians should be free and continue to speak, write or publish freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They do not have to look over their shoulders for fear of someone listening and reporting them to the authorities,&quot;he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Zambia Civic education Association chairperson Lucy Sichone has rebuffed Mwanamwambwa's claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What routine is he is talking about when his government is working hard to imprison, before trial, the editors it arrested?&quot; Sichone asked in an interview yesterday. &quot;The ban of edition 401, and the arrest is all full of malice and in bad faith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP vice- president senior Chief Inyambo Yeta, on Tuesday charged that the arrest of the three editors and the ban of edition 401 is a mockery to democracy and a gross violation of the the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We view this action to be a flagrant abuse of the rights of the freedom of expression and freedom of the press which are provided in Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of Zambia,&quot; Chief Inyambo said at a press briefing on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Foundation for Democratic Process ( FODEP) secretary Bishop John Mambo in an interview yesterday said: &quot;It is the same government that has taken the editors to court over what they call classified documents, and it is the same government preaching about press freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And President Chiluba is said to have been let down by security personnel who delayed in executing the ban of the Monday edition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Post managing director and editor-in-chief Fred M'membe, editor special projects Masautso Phiri and managing editor Bright Mwape are again targets of a state search whose news comes barely four days after the first search on Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police sources told The Post yesterday the state was looking for ways of linking the top editors to artificial clandestine activities aimed at creating insecurity in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The idea is to pin something on you which will give government justification to detain you over a longtime with or without trial and use that to discredit the paper locally and abroad,&quot; warned the source yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second search will be executed by officers from the Criminal Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Zambia police force (now renamed Police Intelligence) and may be led by acting commissioner and district intelligence officer for Lusaka, a Musori.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He will be assisted by detective chief inspector Chiyabi from (CIU) State House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An officer from the military intelligence, a captain John Mwaba, and another from the Zambia National Service, a Lt Colonel Mulenga have been named among the officers enlisted for the second search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is expected that during the search the document which is being prepared by a named senior security officer will be brought and presented as having been found on one or all of the editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state has until late Wednesday afternoon this week held in custody, M'membe, Mwape and Phiri on charges of receiving and publishing information from a classified government document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The action came after President Chiluba used his executive powers to ban their paper's edition 401 on Monday carrying a story exposing governments intention to hold a rushed referendum on selected clauses of the bill of rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The expose came in the wake of increased pressure from the public against government approach to matters of the country's Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state has announced publicly that it would call neither a Constituent Assembly nor a referendum to adopt the new constitution. It legally went round the issue by rejecting any amendments to the old bill of rights, which would have entailed a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Zambian constitution, amendments to the bill of rights can not be made without a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But President Chiluba banned the edition carrying this news and criminalised possession of, and quotations from, the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President is, however, understood to have been let down by security officers who are said to have been &quot;marking time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For some reasons they delayed in moving in and confiscating the papers from the streets. By the time they moved the paper had sold and it made the presidential order useless and invalid,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba had earlier at State House, met Solicitor General Sam Chisulo, the Director of Public Prosecutions Gregory Phiri and Police Inspector-General Francis Ndhlovu on the impending swoop on the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DPP also issued written orders that the three be denied bail by any court in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three editors were held for 36 hours without trial before High Court Judge David Lewanika, on appeal, ordered their release on bail saying &quot;government had acted 'in bad faith' by denying the three their right to bail&quot;.</SPAN></P>
